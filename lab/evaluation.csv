0,Don't eat or drink here. Rooms okay but noisy. Parking scary. Bar and restaurant prices and service ridiculous. Wander to find better anywhere but here. Embarassed to think this represents Arizona for visitors.

1,"So so happy that I have it a try. Being dairy free I never thought I would enjoy a gelato shop, but it is possible. The ladies at frost have an extensive variety of gelatos which looked amazing but also offer an equally impressive sorbet selection.. Strawberry Cristal for V-day has to be the show stopper but at $25 bucks a serving I had to pass. The banana/Cabernet combo I conjured was by far the best sorbet I've ever had. All sorbets are made worn fruit (12 bananas in this case), sugar, and water ( or a whole bottle of Cabernet).. Delish, oddly Frost has warmed my heart. my only suggestions would be to play at the alternatives that they offer a bit stronger. Had I not been walking my child to sooth a pre nap tantrum several times and read the small print about the dairy-free deserts I would have never known, or stopped by.. Great work gals, we will be back!!"
1,"I just moved to the neighborhood, and I LOVE this place. In fact, I should probably give it 5 stars, but I haven't had the sushi there yet. I always get a rice bowl, and the crispy tofu is delicious! I've also had the salmon, and I thought the flavor was great, but the portion was a little small. My favorite thing on the menu is the red curry crab bisque soup, which is out of this world! (I just wish they had a smaller portion that wasn't $5 because I feel like I end up buying 2 dinners). \nWe tried the rice krispies rolled in ice cream for dessert, and I didn't think that was all that great - it sounds better on the menu than it actually is. You won't be disappointed here."
0,"I came here yesterday and had great service. Sandwich was great. Service was fast. But today I came here again and when I got to my car I noticed that there was no cheese in my sandwich so I went inside and asked for a couple piece to put on it. Max, a short Hispanic male worker, was at the register and started asking me for my order details then my ticket number. He started pushing buttons on the register for about four minutes, making a few pieces of cheese a huge deal. When another customer came in he told me to step aside and he will have to keep looking for my ticket so he can charge me for the cheese. I told him to just charge me then. He was very rude with every word that came out of his mouth. There were several other employees there that told him to just hit the cheese button at which point he snapped at them and said, \""don't argue with me!\""  I couldn't believe the disrespect, to me the customer and to his coworkers. This guy has no business being in customer service. He should be moved to the back to wash dishes if he can't handle being polite. After he snapped at the coworker, another one put two pieces of cheese in a sleeve and gave it to me. She said she was just going to pay for it.  \n\nI gave I've star for this restaurant based on Max. If he gets removed from here then I will review my rating."
1,"So this was my first time here, staff off with ambiance a+ it's such a quaint intimate setting with really cool decor.. Gives you a home feeling with the table settings! The staff is friendly and awesome ! I ordered to start calamari salad which was fresh and tasty !! Followed by our entrees homemade ravioli meatballs sausage !! It was honestly wonderful and reminded me of home cooking !! For desert we had their tirmasuzy which was good!! I'm baffled by poor reviews it was just a great place!! Def give it a try on your own"
0,"Do not come here if you want fast service.\nA few teammates and I came here for a quick bite to eat, and we only had an hour. At 5:00 in the afternoon on a Sunday, it was pretty dead and we expected to get in and out quickly. After being seated, our waiter was no where to be seen. After 10 minutes, I was forced to notify the hostess that we had not been greeted by anyone yet. It took another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive (2 sodas and a water), and they were not even correct. When our food came out, I was served an entire salad when I specifically said a side salad with my steak. After realizing his mistake when inputting the order (because he didn't write it down), my correct order was put in. By the time my steak was served to me, my friends had already finished and I had no choice but to box the whole thing up because of our time constraint. It took FOREVER to get our checks, and after looking at mine, they charged me for the steak meal AND the salad meal! I paid in cash to hopefully speed the process up because it was already past our hour time limit. When the waiter came back, he told me there wasn't any change left in the drawer and that he had to get the manager to go in the safe to get more change for the register. At this point, I told him to just keep the change and we were out of there.\nForever."
1,"Pizza is mega rad. I'm a sucker for chewy, bubbly crust like theirs. And you can't beat the lunch specials at less than five bucks for pizza and a drink! Salad bar is a little sketch sometimes at this location. I've seen too many young ones duck the sneeze guard and get crazy with the toppings."
0,"I took my cat in to be boarded for a few days and to get neutered. When he came home he was very lethargic and wouldn't eat or drink. He actually wouldn't even really move and would hide under the covers all day which he never did before.\n\nI assumed this was all normal considering all he had been through and we had just moved into a new apartment. \n\nWell, I noticed last night that he was licking at a huge laceration on his lower abdomen. I must not have noticed it before because he has long hair and must've been keeping it clean and had been hiding so much.\n\nI called the vet and all she could say is that it's unfortunate that he was hurt and it didn't happen there. I know it sure didn't happen in my apt bc I literally took him from the vet to the new empty apt that still has no furniture so there is nothin sharp. I only have an air mattress and I've checked to make sure there aren't any sharp objects anywhere.\n\nSo now my poor cat just had his second surgery in 7 days and is so traumatized. I definitely didn't take him back but to another vet. Beware!!!!"
0,Made reservation for 7:45 and finally sat down at 9:10. Offered many apologies and a free desert but who needs the desert. I finally stood up and asked some friends that we're eating to share left overs and the bartender finally came to our rescued. Finally ate and food is good. I need my drinks comped while I waited over hour.
0,"Listen, people: maybe it was waiting until 11:15 PM to be seated, maybe it was the ear-splitting music which forced us to use our other senses, maybe it was purely hunger delirium -- but it was the best steak and sides we've ever had.\n\nNone of that means anything. It's such a low number of stars to give for such a great meal, expertly served. It means that everything else that STK allowed to happen that night negated any strong points they earned.\n\nWhile waiting for a table, we were witness to such a mind-blowingly disgusting display that it prompted a very serious discussion of our group giving up our reservation altogether, going to In-N-Out Burger (no pun intended), and calling it a night.\n\nAt the table next to us was a man who had obviously called an escort service, had them send a couple of \""workers\"" to meet him at STK, and the three of them gave us a floor show of french kissing, gyrating, miming fellatio and cunnilingus, and general dry-humping, that it's a miracle we could keep our steaks down. Management came over (without us even saying anything -- obviously others were bothered, too) and had terse words with the man, which culled the trio's amorous activities -- temporarily, It was only a matter of minutes until they resumed their table-side  menage-a-trois. When they finally left (like the slow fade of a Viagra commercial), our party came to a realization: we were actually *surrounded* by other couples who were very obviously the products of a \""business transaction\"" as opposed to.....actual dates. Gorgeous African-American young beauty in skin-tight scuba dress un-zippered to the navel seated with nebbish nerd, to cite an example.\n\nYou bet we're in Vegas. Anything goes. And we're fully up for that. But when the conduct of certain patrons supersedes the comfort of others ponying up significant sums for their Wagyu beef, or the management at STK does not see the slippery slope of cheerfully opening their doors as a clubhouse for the sex trade, they might as well change the theme to Thai Ping-Pong Bar and be done with it. (or -- as it was suggested by some in the party -- change the name to \""STD\""?)  Hepatitis (or worse?)  on the forks is a legitimate but secondary concern:  how about the group of us simply wanting to enjoy a glorious steak at midnight served by a wait staff who really knows their stuff without having to be witness to a Hustler Letter to the Editor in the making?\n\nStop the Ho's at the door. For the love of Christ, turn down the music. Now you've really got something."
0,"I work right down the street from La Tolteca so many of my co-workers visit here regularly. I finally visited...\n\nFOOD\nThe menu has a great variety and is pretty inexpensive. However, my burrito kinda started to taste funny as I finished it up- almost like cleaning solution--- I didn't get sick so I'm not sure what that taste was. \nI like the bakery and the sweets selection and the salsa is pretty good. \n\nOTHER\nWe also use this place to cater meal for our late working employees. The catered food was a lot better than my burrito. \n \nI will give La Tolteca another chance..."
1,"Trying new restaurants is a hobby of mine, if you couldn't tell. While doing research for this Vegas trip, I came across Andre's in the Monte Carlo. It's Michelin rated, the menu looked great and the location was perfect. After a few long days in Vegas, staying in the hotel on our last night was a great option. \n\nWhen you cross the casino floor to get to Andre's, you wonder if the noise from the party pit will be bothersome, that is, until the hostess opens the doors to the dining room. This was a really impressive room, it's dark and sexy in browns and blues with touches of purples and grays. High banquettes line one wall with tables around the room. We were seated in a banquette and conversations around us were so muted that if we didn't see the staff attending to other tables, we would have thought we were alone.  The room left us with quite the first impression. The music was great too, I think I knew every song, but I've been told I'm somewhat of a music savant.\n \nRoss, our waiter told us that Chef Andre also owns Alize at the top of the Palms. He used to own a free standing restaurant, also called Andre's, downtown for almost 30 years, but that recently closed. The extensive, mostly French wine list and cocktail menu are presented on an ipad. I went with a Willy Nilly, how can a drink with that name be bad? It was delicious. Gramercy Guy had the Bloody O Cosmo, mine was better.  After determining that we'd both go fish, the sommelier helped us pick out a nice bottle of white.\n\nDinner started with an amuse bouche of frois gras in the shape of a club. For me, it was the perfect creaminess and gaminess that I like. Best part was it did get me excited for the meal to come, my bouche was amused.\n\nThe service was exceptional and the food was superb, our only problem was we had a late lunch and then our new friends from Seattle and Puxatony, PA brought us In-N-Out Burger which is my fast food kryptonite so we couldn't eat most of our dinner. Ross even asked politely if everything was ok with our meal and we told him about the late lunch. I'm not sure he believed us.\n\nEnough people know about Andre's, so it can't be classified as a hidden gem, but I will tell you that I think it's a MUST. \n\nFor pictures and more reviews www.gramercygirl.com"
1,"Worth the 15 min. Drive. Creative concept came thru on all notes , well done  generous portions  left totally satisfied   love the  Drink Menu"
1,"This is a newly opened establishment, which occupies where Super Burrito was.\n\nI ordered a Large Bowl of Shrimp Tom Yum to go; this was my experience.\n\nAtmosphere:  Very clean, typical Thai Buddhist interior; clutter free and peaceful.  The smell of fresh cut ginger, lemongrass, and other traditional Thai ingredients permeated the air and made ordering very difficult. I love that their kitchen in small in size; it guarantees your food is cooked to-order and is completely visible to the customer, which I believe builds trust (cleanliness & food handling is top notch!). \n\nService:  The owner kindly insisted on a glass of water with lime for myself, which she kept refilling until I left.  She chatted with me until my soup was ready for pick-up; she's so sweet.  Food was ready in about 8 minutes or so but I wasn't in a rush.\n\nFood:  I'm actually finishing my huge portion of Shrimp Tom Yum; it's as close to authentic Thai as it gets, or at least since the last time I was in Thailand.  The Shrimp are generous in quantity, high quality (tail left on for flavor), and taste like the sea.  The broth is laced with pieces of ginger, lemongrass, tomatoes, garlic shoots, and quartered mushrooms.  The flavor is citrusy-seafood with a beautiful aftertaste of ginger...I can't get enough.\n\nPrice:  My Tom Yum was very affordable when compared to similar Thai Restaurant prices.  For how freshly it was prepared, the freshness and quality of the ingredients, and the service from the owner,  I would gladly come back.  Their menu was loaded full of traditional Thai and American-Thai favorites...can't wait to try more!\n\nI got a delicious Thai Tea; on the house!  The owner is one of the sweetest women I've met; you have to love Thai people.\n\n***I wish they had a website with a PDF menu option."
0,"I may edit this review at some point in time because I've heard a lot of great things about this venue. But one thing I want to really point out is that John and Eric (two short asian guys) are the worst and most unprofessional bouncers ever. First they accidentally let in the wrong girls in with us and left out our other half of our groups, clearly those extra girls who got in with us are obviously not with us, then we let them know, and they don't even own up to their mistake and complain that we are wasting their time and give us 10 seconds to gather our group of 40 people. Are you kidding me? If you can't maintain your attitude and problem solve then find a new gig, don't be rude."
0,"I give this a rating of zero for the head doctor in charge, Dr. Nichols and this is the only reason for the low rating.  The ladies at the front desk and the nurses are caring and wonderful. And I received good care in previous years with Ms.Vierra but she is no longer at this practice.  I also received 5 star dietary care with the dietician onsite, Mr. Valenzuela and he is still there.  If you need help with weight loss, this is the place.  \n\nThe new assistant, Whitmore is very nice but he is working under Dr. Nichols and I have found the level of care to be slipping.  I was in alot of discomfort and it took me more than 3 weeks of trying over the counter meds to get antibiotics for a serious infection.  The other reason I will not be going back there is lack of patience and bedside manner by Dr. Nichols.  When you are already not feeling well, the last thing you need is to deal with a doctor who is impatient, with a very accusatory bedside manner, and also  making incorrect assumptions about you.  I really think he may be ready for retirement and I can no longer recommend this practice only because of him.    \n\nIt is true what the previous reviewer said about how the receptionists are quick to point out you need to go back for another appointment to talk to the doctor even soon after you just had a visit.  It seems some follow up to the previous problem would not be unreasonable for a call back to answer questions.  This only happened once over the course of over 3+ years of going there, I would 99% of the time have to go back for another visit to talk about a related question, so I do back up the previous reviewer on yelp."
1,Had the 3 bao combo + ice tea.   Loved every bite of it!
1,"Located in the heart of chink town, you wouldn't expect to find a low-key, down to earth Italian eatery but this spot is a regular on my rotation. Nora's is great but I like this place better bc of the atmosphere, service, and food. Sundays for coffee and cookies is a must! I also recommend the pizza and all the pastas."
1,Great place. Stumbled on to it and glad I did. Looked at several other places. I liked the quality of the furniture and Joe made me a great deal on some floor samples and delivered that day. Highly recommend
0,"Saba's is gone! All property seized (by building owners?). Place is completely empty, tables, chairs, fixtures...gone. Been here a helluva lot of years.\n\nI'll miss the patio; RIP Saba's."
1,"Omg!finally! !a great taco place close to me me and my sister have been on a hunt for a while. . ..I tried the asada, carnitas.,and the al pastor....they were all good but the pastor with pineapple. ....with the Orange salsa. .omygod delicious!to die for...I was sad when they were all gone....the salsa bar has great options and all the essentials: cucumbers, radishes,carrots.they also give grilled onions and chiles toreados. Upon request.ah...I'm in love and I'll be back:)"
0,"My 2nd time here. And I still think chick-fil-a is 100x better. This place has one item on the menu. Chicken fingers (and a sandwich i don't feel like trying). They only have their Cane's sauce (a tangy, chipotle mayo mix i didn't like) and Louisiana hot cause. The fries are the ruffled ones (too soggy) and the Texas toast isn't good at all (soggy as well and needs garlic or something to make it taste better). All in all the chicken is pretty solid. It's not great by any means - I'll pass going forward unless I am craving chicken and no nuggets / chick-fil-a is around."
0,"Switch lured me in for breakfast last Saturday boasting of $1 mimosas. She forgot to mention they were made with bad OJ (or was it Sunny D?). She also left out the breakfast burrito I was ordering was pretty much inedible.  I got the ham, egg and cheese burrito and it was not blended. So you either got an egg bite or a ham bite. I hate that. I'm sorry Switch but I won't be coming back (unless of course you have $1 Sangria..)"
0,"The buzz was minimal to non-existent, even with the extra shot of liquor for $5. You'll get diabetes before you'll get hammered.\n\nA pathetic knockoff of Fat Tuesday at a designer price."
0,"As many other reviewers have stated, avoid Cancom and get a train to Glasgow instead. \n\nI bought my iPad 2 from them and after having owned it for a couple of weeks, decided I wanted a better case. So I went back to browse their (limited) stock and was pleasantly surprised to find one I liked. I asked one of the employees how it attached to my iPad, but having no demo models without the giant security tags on them he asked for MY iPad to show me ...\n\nSo I reluctantly handed it over, and he proceeded to jam it in there, clearly struggling to get it to fit. I objected and he returned my iPad to me. I later discovered the corner was broken.\n\nGo in, browse, have a play with their demo models, then if you like what you see either order online or go to the Apple store in Glasgow. Don't buy from Cancom."
0,Let me first say ordered for the kids but I was not home when they brought the food my children didn't tip ! But the kids like the food so much the next knight I said well lets order again my daughter goes to place an order the guy told my children they wont deliver because we did not tip the night before ! although on the menu its says they add 1.99 to delivery ! last I herd tips are 100% up to you not mandatory ! So when I call to talk to somebody the kid said to me your not worth our time to deliver ! I ask to talk to a manager he says I don't know but I can take and order now ! Third so called manager I call and tried to see if this is how they run things by telling kids who had enough to buy food but our money isnt good enough he says well mam I don't know they did nothing but make it a worse experience  good food but that kind of business is not worth my money!!!!!
1,Fast and fresh breakfast! I like the simple things for breakfast sometimes and they do a great job at it. Will definitely be back.
0,"Pratt's is a nice local pet store that has a large selection of poultry and rabbits along with a small variety of reptiles and mammals. They also have a large selection of bird supplies.\nI went to the store looking for reptiles and reptile supplies. They had a few bearded dragons*, some corn snakes and a couple of ball pythons. More impressively they had a large collection of sulcata tortoises. Their tortoises are more expensive than most other local pet stores, but they had a larger selection than most other stores, meaning there is a greater variety to choose from.\nBehind the store they have an area with chickens, pigeons, pigs and a goat that was very interesting.\nThis store is definitely worth going to just to look around even if you're not interested in buying anything.\n\n*Edit\nOn my last visit I couldn't see a bearded dragon that didn't have a physical defect. They had plenty of lizards, but each one had either a missing toe or nub tail. This was in December and I haven't been back since."
0,"The spot is really cool looking, a bar nestled up against the lake tucked into a corner of a larger building. I stopped by with a couple friends to have a quick drink. After quite a bit of a struggle to get someone to take our order and get some drinks, we enjoyed the time on the patio and the seats were a little old but still comfortable. \nOnce we got our drinks, we never saw our server again. Once we finished our drinks and were ready to leave, I wandered around trying to find someone to pay our tab with for nearly 10 minutes before abandoning hope, guessing the total of our order, leaving $20 on the table and walking out.\nI couldn't believe it. I read some other reviews now for this place, and it seems like this is pretty commonplace type service here."
1,"Entree was definitely not hot enough but otherwise everything was very yummy. If you're ordering the steak, I suggest Lux Cafe downstairs instead."
1,It was good while it lasted.  I think it's closed now.  Not sure.
0,"Risking my life for a run-of-the-mill haircut....\n\nFirst of all, for those of you going to this great clips from Squirrel Hill: good luck.  Write a will.  Kiss your children goodbye, since making a left turn across Brown's Hill Road is about as safe as playing on the interstate with steak knives.\n\nGoing to this Great Clips is a little like playing haircut roulette: you never know what you're going to get.  I've been twice now, and once I got a pretty decent cut, and once, well, I kind of looked bald.\n\nThis last trip was actually pretty bad.  I went at about 10:00 and they had a line of five people, with two stylists.  They said it would be about 20 minutes.  It was actually about an hour.  And the sad thing is several people came in after me, and at one time, the line was seven people long, and they always said it would be 20 minutes.  20 minutes seems to be the standard answer, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nWhile I was there, I did see one nice thing: they fix bad haircuts for free.  An old lady came in unhappy with her cut, and they got her in right then.  (No waiting in line for re-do's, apparently.)  The stylist was very sweet with her and fixed it for free.  I kind of wish I had known they fix bad haircuts, but then again, there's not much you can do when your hair's so short it looks bald.  Eh.  It grows out, right?"
0,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. The best three words I could use to explain the service, quality and accountability. Bug guts galore still left on my car and when I confronted the head of the \""finish line\"" he wiped it a little and that was it. I could easily wipe the bugs off with a finger, and the cherry air freshener smells like cough syrup. I purchased the supreme wash and the service at the front was impeccable and friendly. Thoroughly disappointed with the quality of the wash and UNWILLINGNESS to fix their mistakes. WILL NOT return here and will be sure to suggest no one else comes. Great atmosphere. Unsatisfied with the finished product."
0,"We went here about a week ago. It was a nice atmosphere with decent decor, friendly service and seemingly fair prices given the location inside the upscale Tivoli Village. Both the inside and outside seating areas looked nice, well-lit with good ambiance. We opted to sit outside... which was a mistake. It reeked of smoke coming from the cigar shop next door. No matter, two drinks (each) later and we didn't care so much. The guacamole was very good and that's about it. We ordered chorizo tacos, chicken enchiladas, and vegetarian enchiladas. All three dishes were extremely greasy. Like, grease with a side of food greasy. The enchiladas looked like something from a gas station. The chicken dish tasted fine but the vegetarian dish was not good at all. I did not try the tacos because I personally do not like chorizo, although the person who ordered them did enjoy them. The vegetarian in our group did not finish their food but both of us carnivores did. This, again, was a mistake. I'll spare you the details but thanks to all that grease and possibly in part to the cigar smoke, we both were very sick the entire next day. At first I thought I had a fever but it was very clearly food-related. Yuck."
1,"I took my adult daughter here for her birthday. We both loved the Aria! It is clean, modern, new, and it doesn't smell from smoke. They have some kind of nice smelling fragrance in the air. All of the employees have smiles and are extremely polite and helpful. The management must have a top notch program because you could definitely tell that each person that works at the Aria is finely trained in their jobs. The room was gorgeous, with comfortable beds and a large bathroom. I liked that everything it high tech. You can control the temperature, drapes, wake up calls, etc. all from the television! We appreciated the security downstairs controlling the entrance to the elevators. We had a view of the strip and at night it was impressive. We had two closets and plenty of drawers. Don't touch anything in the mini bar because it is all computerized and you will be charged. Wish there was more room in the mini bar to put a few of our own bottles of water. By the way, you can't find a cup of coffee or a bottle of water anywhere in the hotel for under $4.00.  Plenty of nice restaurants to chose from and many shops to walk through. We didn't use the pools, but we did walk out to see them and there are many to choose from. We ate breakfast at Cafe Vettro which was good. Had a dinner at Lemongrass, the Thai restaurant. That was awesome, but as with all of the restaurants in the Aria, a little pricey. $20 for fried rice....really? \nSpeaking of pricey, I understand room taxes at hotels. But they charge a resort fee of $22 per day. What do you get? Free Wifi (don't need it with an iphone) a free newspaper which is not delivered to your room, and use of the fitness center. When I asked about taking that off the bill I was told that they couldn't, so now tack that on to the room taxes and the price starts to rise. Other than that issue, I would stay at the Aria again. No one told us that there is a free monorail tram from the Monte Carlo, Aria and Bellagio but we figured it out on our last day. The whole city center area is new, sleek and modern. Stay there, you will love it."
0,"Will give Echo & Rig another try because our steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and flavored. Unfortunately, the service was not up to par. We dined downstairs, early dinner. We watched as one couple left because there was no server in sight. When  one popped up, we seemed to haven disturb her. Took our order, no follow up, just the check."
0,"Dreadful, rude service- borderline bullies, poor selection, and they severely mark up their prices!!! Both my friend and I found a dress that they have at other stores for a fraction of the cost. Unacceptable. What a joke, really. Not at all what you want to have to endure while planning the most important outfit you'll ever wear! So upsetting!"
1,"no this place isnt \""top of the line\"" but id hafta say.. i love staying here.\n\nits in the middle of the strip.. prices arent bad if you're staying with a big group and don't mind rooming together. (you know you get some bitchy ass friends that come along and \""ugh i dont want to sleep on the floor\"" or \""theres too many of us for one bathroom\"") STFU!! ITS VEGAS! its not like youre going to be in the room 247 GEEZ! \n\nthe only rooms we get here are the NORTH tower grand suites. do it!"
1,"Ah, the mythical Kay's bar. Said to appear only when the moon is full, the temperature is in the 9-11 degree region, and you recite the words to Sunshine On Leith backwards. In Spanish. It's an alcoholic Brigadoon.\n\nOr, it's off the beaten track and people can't be bothered walking that far. Not sure.\n\nIn any case, it's a great little local bar, with a good selection of real ales, and a fine selection of whiskies along the top gantry. It's also small and red. RED. LOTS OF RED. ALL THE RED. That's not a complaint, just an observation of the redness.\n\nIf I was a local in this area, I fear I would never leave here. There would be no need for me to go anywhere else, as this is a damn fine establishment.\n\nOne of Edinburgh's better kept secrets.\n\nEntirely visible at all times, too - despite what you might hear..."
1,"Vegetarian Pho and Lemongrass Tofu...amazing!  Trying to eat low calorie and low carb, so I ordered these dishes without rice or noodles, and they were still sooooo good. \n\nThe pho broth is the best I've ever tried, with complex flavors and the ability to modify per your tastes (lime, jalape\u00f1o, sriracha, chili oil). It came loaded with soft tofu and veggies - cauliflower, broccoli, carrot, green onion, celery, mushrooms, bean sprouts. You can get crispy fried tofu if you prefer. \n\nThe lemongrass tofu and vegetables was sweet but great.  Next time I'll add sriracha, but spicy is my personal preference.  We basically licked the plate clean. \n\nThe Vietnamese coffee was such a treat. A glass with sweetened condensed milk is brought to the table with the coffee dripping down into the glass from a French press-type of contraption on top. The coffee itself is  strong and harsh. Went down like burnt rubber for a newbie coffee drinker like me. But once the milk is mixed in, it's delicious. And even better once it's poured over ice. The calorie heavy sweetened condensed milk makes it an indulgence I'll try to resist in the future, but I know now I'm likely to fail. \n\nI can't stop thinking of this place."
1,"Food was very good and it came out quickly.  Only issue was the waitress, had to ask for two menus, then we ordered two beers but only got one, then getting enough to go boxes was challenging."
1,"I'd almost give them 5 stars other than the barber made me bleed with the straight razor haha. Nothing crazy, but they did a really good bald fade. I was worried since I just moved here from Michigan."
0,"What can you expect from airport food? Granted, they do have a good selection. Prices are high per usual but there is ample seating and they give you ice water instead of redirecting you to a fountain. The food was so-so. But again, what do you expect?"
1,I called Waterboy Pool Services for an urgent Pump Motor Replacement. Ryan happened to be in my neighborhood and was at my house in less than 20 minutes. He took excellent care of me and got my pool up and running in no time!! Thanks to Waterboy Pool Service and Ryan!!!
0,"I feel so sorry for people that come here as a tourist or with out of town guests.  Folks, this is as bad as it gets.  \n\nLiving in Las Vegas I can deal with having a crappy restaurant experience and paying too much because sometimes you just don't know or have a choice.  Unfortunately, I had never been here and had a couple of out of town guests who googled Italian food on their phone and this one popped up and was close to their hotel.\n\nI tried to steer them away from this place as restaurants on or near the strip are usually incredibly overpriced and the food is usually at best mediocre.   Well my attempt at steering them to a known commodity did not work.\n\nBattista's it was.\n\nI'm not going to get into details on this place as they have been discussed ad nauseum on Yelp.\n\nThe food in this place is not only unpalatable but is probably dangerous.  Chemical tasting food that I can picture being cooked up in large tubs in the back is what this place serves.\n\nThe 'wine' they serve is not quite up to the same quality someone on food stamps would buy to use as cooking wine.  Don't get me wrong I don't mind cheap wine but this stuff was not fit to be consumed by humans.\n\nTo top it all off they serve a Nescafe Corn Syrupy type chocolate drink at the end.\n\nThis place has a cozy ambiance according to other review but that's where the positives end.  This place preys on unsuspecting tourists who don't know any better until it's too late.  I can't imagine anyone ever going back to this place.\n\nThis place treats its customers like cattle, well, maybe worse actually.  They could care less about your experience and possible return business since they are located in a spot that see's a few million new visitors each year.  This restaurant wouldn't last 3 months in another city that must rely on return customers and positive word of mouth.\n\nPlease people do not go to this awful place with these awful people.  This restaurant represents everything that is wrong with the Las Vegas dining scene."
0,"Most of the negative reviews here are pretty accurate. However a lot of the people writing them are contradicting themselves. It makes no sense that people are complaining that they had to wait in line too long, but then went on to say that the club was overcrowded. What else did you expect? Let people in and make it more crowded, or make people wait in line. They can't do both.\n\nAnyway, you're better off spending your money at another club on the strip.  My GF and I went to Haze in March 2010 on a weeknight, got there around midnight. I know for the most part couples are generally frowned upon by nightclub bouncers, but nonetheless they're making money off of us too. There was literally 5 other people in line and they made us wait for a pretty long while. After about 30 minutes of waiting I slipped the bouncer a 20 and he finally let us in (normally if the line was crazy I'd tip the bouncer $25 per person). We were being polite to the bouncers but they were still being major stuck up douches, absolutely no need for that. On top of that we paid the ridiculous cover. The club wasn't too crowded, but the drinks were way overpriced. Yes it's Vegas and it's to be expected to spend some cash, but there is something wrong with paying $45 for two redbull + jager drinks. Also what's with the guys with the flashlights thinking they're so effin special? They shove through the crowd yelling \""MAKE A HOLE\"" as if they're escorting President Obama out of a brawl. Most of the times they do this it appears to be for no reason at all. It makes the clubbing experience even less enjoyable when you're getting pushed around like that.  There is really nothing special about Haze that makes it stand out from the other clubs. There are clubs here in San Antonio that have better service, sound system, design, lighting, atmosphere, etc. for a fraction of the amount you spend. For being in a nice place like Aria you'd have much higher expectations for a club. Don't ruin your night by going to Haze."
0,"Worest frederick's of Hollywood I have ever been in. No selection, and unhappy and unhelpful sales people. The one sales girl was just sitting on the floor behind the register like she didn't even want to be there, the other couldn't help me find what I was looking for. Don't go to this one, use the fashion show or boulavard location!!"
0,"Service is awful, even for Chinese people (I'm Chinese, so I am socially qualified to make that statement.) Food is good occasionally, but I question their hygienic standards.\n\nFor example, I know that Peking duck is not supposed to taste rancid. It tasted rancid twice in my frequent visits, and I eat there mostly because my in-laws like the place. \n\n\""The duck tastes off.\"" I said.\n\n\""No it doesn't.\"" said the waitress without missing a beat.\n\nOnce, while dining with my toddler son, my wife asked if they had anything for him to drink along with his water. We asked for milk or orange juice, both of which they had none. \""What do you give kids, then?\"" asked my wife. \""Just give him soda.\"" said the waitress. My father-in-law decided to have the Special of the Day. \n\n\""We don't have the Special of the Day.\"" said the waitress, her deadpan face never betraying the dripping irony of the statement. The manager came out soon thereafter. \n\n\""Sorry, we don't have the special of the day today, sir. Can I get you the wonderful fresh cod that we're known for? It's steamed with traditional spices for half an hour and served on a bed of greens-- a delight to the taste, especially with a splash of light Pinot Noir.\""\n\n... is what he never said. Instead, the cap-and-jeans dude looked irritated and said, \""Get number 44. We don't have special. Get 44.\""\n\n\""What's 44?\"" \n\n\""It's good.\"" And he walked away."
0,Feels just like a college bar. Ridiculously hot in there... Everyone had sweat dripping off their forehead! Please turn up the AC!!  Sound system is also TERRIBLE!  The Instruments so loud that no one can make out the vocals. Lot's of girls except that 50% are lesbians!  $6 dollar cover charge for locals too and it's not worth it.
1,"Surprised I saw such bad talk about this place. I almost did not book it.... Luckily, I did. \nIt was very nice, the staff was so helpful and went totally out of their way to help me..\nBreakfast was pleasant, but what can you say for a continental breakfast?\nEasily accessible to the  highway, walk to eat some dinner or if you need to head to \nWalmart it's a short drive away."
1,"There are a lot of detailed reviews here so I'll just list the main points:\n- HUGE club, indoor and outdoor.\n- Plays Top 40\n- Drinks are Vegas priced\n- Line up early @ 9:00pm to get in without a super long wait.  The line will be LONG.\n- Lots of azns (^_^).  That's kind of a no-no for me.  Don't get me wrong, I'm half Chinese, but I like to hang out with a more diverse group of people than the attention whoring Asian chicks and the rice rocket B-Boy crew.\n- Gets extremely crowded around midnight.  You won't be able to move.  Seriously.\n- $30 cover for men, $20 for women\n\nOverall, it's one of the best clubs I've been to and my husband, who hates clubs actually liked this place too, so have fun if you're deciding to come here while you're in Vegas!"
0,"It takes a special kind of evil for a corporate giant like Microsoft to step on local small business owners while putting up a fake veneer of community involvement.\n\nTyler B. is the Community Event Liaison that works for the Microsoft Store in Scottsdale and she was impossible to work with for organizing a community event.  She refused to take or return phone calls, wouldn't answer questions in emails and even failed to share the dates and times of the event in which I was supposed to participate.  How is that supposed to work?  She made it impossible for our studio to contribute by refusing to communicate or cooperate.\n\nShe made it abundantly clear with several emails that she was too busy to be bothered.  Phone calls forbidden.  We only communicated by email where she was extremely condescending and all she was able to do was to say NO!  Furthermore, the information that she did manage to share turned out to be false.\n\nI told her that I didn't think the Microsoft Store was the right venue for my open-source software lesson and she told me that I didn't have a choice.  I had to go and give the presentation because they listed it without my details, approval or knowledge.\n\nTo resolve this she insisted that I come to the store and meet with a techie that could make things work.  I did this and the gentleman was kind enough but really didn't seem to know what to do so instead wasted over an hour of our time until I finally had to present the simple solution that I suggested from the very start but that Tyler told me was not allowed.  Typical run around to waste time.  Turns out it was allowed.\n\nWhy would Microsoft employ someone as a Community Liaison if that person refuses to communicate, gives false information and wastes a whole month of time to accomplish absolutely nothing while maintaining this mean person agenda?  Did I deserve this disgusting behavior because I am a Linux user?  Apparently these are the games that the Microsoft Store teaches their employees to play with small businesses that don't use Windows.\n\nMicrosoft should be ashamed to employ such a despicable person for Community Outreach.  When I declined to participate the second time due to Tyler's continued lack of communication she wrote unfounded, nasty [slander] things about a person and trashed [libel] a business that she never took a moment to learn about simply because she failed to do her job and communicate.\n\nI'm sure Microsoft can can do better by finding a person that actually wants to communicate and do the job.  Tyler B. is obviously not the right person to organize Community Events and if Microsoft really wants to connect with local businesses and the community then they need to make things right.  Stop playing games and send Tyler walking."
0,Horrible place. The service sucks!! The wings are not even that good. We tried all the sauces and they sucked! They tasted like they came out of a jar. I do not recommend for foodies. Just like a chain. Two thumbs down!
1,"This was a rare find! I'm a gluten free vegan and it was great to be able to order anything I wanted on the menu! We actually ate here once on our trip to LasVegas and came back the next day to pick up a dessert to go. For our dinner, I had the Beet Burger and my  boyfriend had the Enchilada. We loved both of them! The avocado \""fries\"" weren't really to my taste, but the burger more than made up for it!  For dessert the first time, I had the \""cheesecake\"" I was a little disappointed because it was not made in the store, but prepackaged. It tasted fine, though. The second dessert we got the  next day to go, was \""fudge\"". It was good, but the name is misleading. The \""fudge\"" was made with oats and nuts. It was good, but not fudge like. Also, the staff was not sure if the oats were gluten free, or not .This place has the typical health food store atmosphere that I love and will definitely come back again!"
0,I've been here before and it was better then.  The burger was average go and nothing to be excited about.
1,"This is my \""impressor\"" restaurant. Whenever I have friends or family come in from out of town, this is where I take them. Service is always top-notch and the food is amazing. I highly recommend making a reservation - they will take you very quickly if you do. I've never had to wait more than 5 min. if I made a reservation; going in on a Friday night without a reservation was about an hour wait. That's to be expected. You usually wait longer for a patio table, because of its excellent views, but I say skip it if you've seen the fountains - the inside is usually quiet and calm, so it makes for a much more relaxing meal.\n\nYou hungry after that wait? No problem. They're going to bring you a fresh baguette with an amuse-bouche that you'll dream about for months. For an appetizer, get the brie and put it on that delicious bread. They only give you four crostinis with the brie, which can seem a little chintzy, but with the bread there, you have plenty of carbs to put your brie on.\n\nI've taken vegetarian friends and carnivorous friends here alike and they've all found something delicious on the menu. I highly recommend the filet mignon in merlot butter - it comes with crispy chipped fries which are the perfect combination of fry and potato chip. \n\nHonestly, I've never made it to dessert, because I've been so stuffed after savoring every last bite of my filet. I've even taken my culinarily-non-adventurous parents here, and they LOVED it. This restaurant's safe for all tastes and though it's a Strip price (about $60-person) it's worth every penny."
0,Called to order chicken wings and fries from the lady doing the orders from the phone she was rude and kept putting me on hold when I started ordering. Then the wait which was suppose to be 45 minutes turned out to be longer then that because the driver couldn't find my address despite me telling him the cross streets.  Finally get my food and the chicken wings are dry and there is more bone then meat on the wings and the fries were overcooked I threw it out I can't believe I wasted 30 bucks on that with the mozzarella sticks which was the only good thing pathetic avoid this place at all cost.
1,"It's been a while since I've been to On the Border. I think it was when I was in college when I first went and it was pretty wack. It was beyond wack... I couldn't believe this place existed. I guess they did an overhaul on the menu... perhaps I have the restaurants confused... oh well... This day! Kat made the experience and food great. Sometimes when the food is okay, the staff makes the people come back. Kat hooked us up with extra and gave us tips on the food. I've been here a couple times but this time was the best. I customized my fajitas and got the pulled pork and grilled chicken. I put the saut\u00e9ed onions, peppers, guacamole, sour cream, refrained beans, queso, shredded cheese, and salsa. \n\nYea... I'm one of those people who puts a lot of sh*t in my eggs... But I like it. Chips and salsa are good. Definitely coming back to this location, especially if Kat is here."
1,I just have to add that this place is so good I ate here two nights in a row.....this is in the city with a million restaurants as well.\n\nJust thought I'd add.
1,"This is a very basic Mexican restaurant in one of the oldest strip malls in Goodyear. We have been going here for about 7 years now. It is one of those places one goes when one thinks about it. The food is almost always good, but has missed its mark a few times. In this miss it is usually because the food is just not warm enough. But this is not the norm. Working here one earns the money and it is done with a smile and efficiency. SO if you are ever in the neighborhood give them a try."
0,"To sum up Dollar @ PHX in a few sentences I would say,  they are the type of place that works hard to fee you and upsell items through fear, omission of facts and deception.  You should read the bad reviews here and BELIEVE them and if I was you, no matter how cheap of a rate you got, just move on.  In the end it will end up costing you money, time and add to your stress level if you rent here.  \n\nSo here is my story.  I used airline miles to get a free rental at Dollar.  I read the Yelp reviews just before we left and knew some of the \""gotchas\"" to watch for (I wish I had done this before I booked).  Honestly, if it wasn't such a headache to change the reservation (since I used miles) I would have, but chose to stick it out.  \n\nWhen we got to the counter (after what seemed like a 20 minute shuttle ride) I told them I had a reservation and my name.  The attendant asked why I was visiting and I told him for Spring Training.  So here is where it starts, he looks at me and my husband (and our 1 suitcase) and says that we will never fit us & the suitcase in their compact car (what we booked) because they only had  tiny 2 door compacts with a hatchback.  I tell him we will be fine, we drive a mini regularly and I can't imagine they are smaller than that!  He grumbles something and moves.  \n\nNext he asks, do you want FULL insurance or MINIMAL insurance.  The catch here, I want NO insurance and he doesn't give that option.  When I say, I want NO insurance he says, well cars get really beat up at Spring Training if you have a problem and the car is out of commission we are going to charge you a hefty price all the days it is out of commission.  Yes, because I am obviously going to park the car the baseball diamond and let people have at it.  Ridiculous.  We move on.  NO insurance.  You are covered by your own car insurance and we have additional insurance via our credit card, so it really is a useless added on fee. \n\nThen he asks if I will pre-pay for gas or fill it myself.  I choose the latter.  What he fails to tell me and what I knew from Yelp and the receipt (because I searched it out), was that they  REQUIRE you to have receipt when you return the car proving you filled it up within 10 miles of the return location.  If you don't, they charge you almost $10/gallon!!! So at any rate he grumpily tells me where to get the car and when we go down there are literally 20 cars that are all 4 doors and pretty spacious compacts (we got a Nissan Sentra). I guess between me signing and getting my car all the tiny hatchbacks got rented? Yeah.   Oh and when you leave they make you show them your driver's license again, which was annoying since I had packed it all back in my bag and had to dig it out. I am sure this is because they charge you for each driver and since we only had one on the contract they did a double check.    \n\nWe returned the car and made sure we were not charged anything, but it was a kind of nagging annoyance.  A company should just be up front about their charges and policies and let the consumer decide what they wish to do.  This cat and mouse game of deceit and gotchas is just unprofessional.  I will never use Dollar again. Unfortunately, I think it is Dollar's way of doing things, check any other airport and you find the same complaints!"
0,"I was expecting an outstanding spa experience in Vegas, only to be left feeling disappointed with the services. i expected to pay a little more for the service than at home, but the spa was just dirty. There was hair clogging all the sinks and shower drains, the robes were raggedy. I couldn't believe the conditions of the slippers and robes. The drinks consisted of water with apple slices and they had oranges and apples for snacks for the women, but my husband said he didn't have the fruit on his side. One of my services was a 25 min facial. Nothing specials, no extractions, just massage and cream. The only other services that were part of the spa was a steam room, a whirlpool and a cool water pool. Very disappointed with the whole scene especially since it is the only thing I look forward to doing when coming to Vegas.\nI think I would be the extra money and try a spa at another hotel on the strip."
1,"I love buffets. Period. The only downside to my dinner visit was that I was already sort of full from a late lunch, which meant I couldn't fit much into my belly :( Sad, I know.\n\nSo my bf and I came here Friday night for dinner and it was pretty crowded. Not too too crowded where you have to wait your turn to get food or when the food runs out and you have to wait for it to be replaced. I've been to the Hokkaido in Long Beach, CA and this was pretty similar to that one. They had a pretty good selection of sushi and sashimi (salmon, octopus, and something else I forget). There was lots of steamed crab legs that never ran out and some pretty (unusually) huge cooked clams. See my photo. They were huge! The food was good and the buffet was clean. However, the service was spectacular! The waitresses were extremely nice and always had a smile on their face, which was a pleasant change from the typical Asian buffets where the waitresses seam to dislike taking the plates off your table.\n\nDessert selection okay. I did like how they had about 8 different ice cream self-serve flavors. The other desserts didn't really stand out to me. The only downside to the dessert section was the chocolate fountain. The bottom level... um... seemed murky (kinda like the dirty water that gets caught in the side of a lake) and definitely needed to be changed. Let's just say I did not touch that chocolate fountain.\n\nOther than that, I had a good dinner. Only wished I could fit more in my stomach :)"
0,"place was a bit dirty in my opinion\nfruit fly in my water and received a dirty dish to use for our appetizers.\nprobably wont be back, rather drive to Lindo Michoacan which is maybe 5 minutes away\nbest thing about this place was the food runner, he helped us more than our actual server."
0,"Review for second experience only.\n\nI had such an amazing experience at Lawry's the first time I was there that I had to reserve to dine again for my birthday this past weekend. The second time around was not as satisfying as the first.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\n- the bread was cold\n- the waitor did not informed the party about added charges beforehand\n- ordered medium rare prime rib, but prime rib was nearly cooked and chewy. I only had 4 bites and was immediately sad that it did not taste like the first time around.\n- I was in love with the salad, but didn't taste as good as the first time\n- it felt like the waitor was in a rush\n\nSplit charge is $15... Seriously? I come in a high end-high end restaurant, expecting to pay good money for good food but there were unnecessary charges. $15 to cut a piece of meat and put it on another plate is unreasonable. I could have done it myself. Secondly, the portions are big and could be fit for two people... But my party was charged $8 per plate for a measly salad.\n\nIt was my birthday, but was also charges $8 for dessert. I'm not saying that it should be complimentary but as a known high-end restaurant, you want to accommodate to your customer's satisfaction so that they can come back and spend more.\n\nSo basically.. 3 split charges.. $15 each coming out to $45, plus the two salad plates $16, and the cheesecake $8. Coming total to $69 in charges (almost 1/3 of our bill). I was so disappointed that I am not sure if I want to come back. The bill was $306, but tipped the waitor $35 because I thought it was nice ENOUGH. It would have been more if there weren't so many added charges.\n\nComparing this to other high-end prime rib/steakhouses... Lawry's loses to Flemings, Ruth Chris and Morton's by miles. As a high-end restaurant, added charges should not be one of the concerns - makes the customers feel like you are more about making that extra money, rather than making them happy.\n\nNeedless to say, birthday dinner was a big disapppointment."
0,Dave. Henderson.  I love the place but. I am never ordering a burger there again. The burger was a defrosted thin mcdonalds Big Mac style single patty. With less taste. Where's the beef. I ordered a venison chili burger but there was so little chili I had to call the waitress to show it to me. She lifted the bun with her hand touched the patty and said it was between the cheese and the patty. I still couldn't find it. She took it back and brought the same one back. And said that's the way they make it. The manager brought a dinky little bowl of chili but no spoon.  Service was not good. Too bad
1,"Excellent food, excellent service.  It's hard to find good food in Vegas without heading to a five-star restaurant.  I'm a big food critic, and this place is absolutely excellent."
1,"I like the trendy low key feel of this place. And the few isn't bad either of the Palazzo and T.I\n\nPhilly cheesesteaks in a potsticker? Unique. Girls ask for the cotton candy kiss.\nThis place gets 5 stars for the uniquenss of the menu and drinks. It's hard to stand out in the restaurants on the strip but this place does a fantastic job of it. Also I tried their duck and was great. \nOh yeah You get a free pretzel, eh, but a nice place overall."
0,Mediocre food. Very poor service.
0,"I cannot believe how a business can afford being gone for so long. Oh well, seems like they are back now. We were super excited to go and have some ribs again. mhhh The ribs were burned and they had a different sauce on them, not the usual rib sauce but some vinegary disgusting sauce. Was so disappointed."
0,"Most Unfortunate! This was our first time in Zupas, we drive by all the time and they always seem busy but now we can't figure out why. The clean and modern decor mixed with the larger than life posters of their food and the word \""Perfect\"" contrasted greatly with the actual food we ordered. I tried the Tuscan white bean soup and my wife tried the cauliflower. They were both so salty we couldn't make it through half the bowl, there was no garnish on either soup and little to no flavor. We split the ultimate cheese sandiwich - also underwhelming, salty and reasonably bland. The beverage selection was poor unless you like soda and the staff seemed oblivious to anyone or anything around them. The best part of the experience was only having to lose $12 on the ordeal and the highlight was leaving. \n\nWe won't be back and suggest you stay away unless you're into poorly constructed, bad food for cheap."
1,"Lancasters has some of the best BBQ around, but if you don't like Eastern NC style BBQ, its not the place for you."
1,"This place supplies a bunch of Montreal's cafes with their pastries, and there's a good reason why - they're fantastic.\n\nMy favourite is their chocolate croissant, but the cookies, muffins, and everything else I've tried is great. I haven't yet tried their bread or savoury options, but that's because I just can't stop buying their sweets.\n\nThe store is on a back-street in St Henri - the kind of location you would never run across by accident, but I guess they cater to a more commercial crowd. That being said, it's a cosy little store, with some table and chairs outside that would be nice in the warmer weather.\n\nIf you're not from St Henri, are in the neighbourhood, and have a sweet tooth, you MUST come here. If you're from St Henri, you've got no excuse."
1,"For a great Medieval time, get to the Tournament of Kings!\n\nThe show has been in town for years and has always been fun.  I have seen this show several times over the years and have always had a blast! You can go in and leave adulthood at the doors and let your inner child run free!\n\nWhen you walk in to the theater, you are transported to a medieval castle.  You are seated in a King's section, whom you will root for during the tournament. Merlin is out and about during this time and is entertaining the crowd.  He also teaches you how to act during the show.  Hazzah! The show starts and you will just have so much fun from there on out.  I don't want to say too much and spoil the show for you!\n\nDinner is decent as well.  You get a bowl of soup, a Cornish hen, some veggies, and a dessert.  The fun part is that there aren't any utensils.  Embrace your inner caveman and eat with your hands.  Yummy!\n\nThe price is also a good point.  The tickets are usually about $50 and you can find coupons if you look around.  It is a fun show that you can do without breaking the bank.  It is also a must see if you have kids."
1,"The most enjoyable moment in Edinburgh: on a Saturday afternoon, the rain stopped and sunshine appeared, you walk through the meadows seeing that young people were playing tennis and jogging, parents with their kids were playing, grannies just sat on the bench enjoying the sunshine. Everything was peaceful."
0,"Blech.  I think I must have been at a different buffet than these other reviewers, because this was horrible.  When we walked in, it was like we were in the South Pacific.  Seriously.  The thermostat must have been set at 90.  A nice change from the 40 degree weather outside, but after about three minutes, it was the worst.  Maybe that's for atmosphere, but it was not enjoyable.\n\nTo make the experience even less appetizing, the place is cramped and the staff does not help at all in this regard - they are constantly in the middle of the aisles, writing tickets and getting drinks in the middle of the walking areas and the like.  Again, they could be going for atmosphere, and having the staff constantly around is nice, but with overbearing heat and little room to move it's not good.  It's bad.  Really bad.  If you don't like personal space, you're good.  Really good even.  Otherwise, it stinks.  Literally.  I've been to restaurants in big cities, where rent is outrageous, that have more room to move than this.  In Pineville, there ought to be all sorts of elbow room (Schoolhouse Rock anyone?).\n\nYes, there is a sushi bar where a guy makes it in front of you.  Let me first tell you that I'm not really a sushi guy.  I like California rolls and those little rice cakes with shrimp on them, and a few other things, but none of the more exotic stuff.  But this was nasty.  He would take a big fried thing and plop it down on a plate and squirt some heavy mayo-like sauce all over it.\n\nThat's not too bad, right?  Well, once the rolls were gone, he'd do it again - without cleaning the plate.  That's right, there was a buildup of this mayo on the platter.  Several varieties, all right there under the lights.  It was pretty sickening.  Like a sushi hog pond.\n\nOn the regular buffet, it wasn't too bad, but it wasn't that good either.  If you want a Southern food buffet (meat, rolls, corn), it's okay.  But the Chinese food was just average.  Add that to the place, the staff, the price - go elsewhere.  China King and Dragon House aren't far away, and Tin Tin is just up the street (though I'm not a huge fan of Tin Tin either).  You'll have a much nicer experience."
0,"With my Groupon about to expire I made my way across town to check out Taiga. My experience reminded me why I rarely buy Groupons anymore -- the restaurants usually aren't very good.\n\nThe interior is chic and sexy with some really comfortable chairs. That's pretty much the highlights of the place. The cuts of fish that made up the garlic tuna nigiri were ample, but the quality was poor and stringy. The tuna in the tuna maguro (tuna tuna?) was the same quality. There was plenty of cabbage with the dish but it was drowning in dressing that drowned out the flavors of every other component in the dish. The Tiger roll was the best item we had but still not that memorable.\n\nNo matter how good the interior looks or how good the menu might sound the poor quality of the ingredients doomed this place from the beginning. Another Groupon, another disappointing dining experience..."
1,Ok so the atmosphere was good the service was good but the pollo fundido is probably the reason i will go back..That thing for 11 bucks...ya sign me up for 2.
0,"I like pretty much any shopping opportunity, but this collection of outlets intermixed with a few 'regular' stores, cell-phone and lotion kiosks, was just...  depressing. \n\nWith a few exceptions, a majority of the retailers seemed to sell very similar merchandise (I counted 5 shops selling baseball caps) or things that were just plain strange (a chain-mail suit!?).  I suppose that would be great if you wanted one for an upcoming renaissance faire.\n\nI am sure there were amazing deals to be had, but they simply eluded me.  Maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind to dig through mountains of merchandise.  I may return when I am feeling more 'adventurous'.\n\nI add a star because it had A/C and my friend did find a very good deal on t-shirts.  Otherwise..."
0,"It's a good thing we got groupons for this and didn't have to pay full price. Bottom line is that it's not worth the experience.\n\nDon't come hungry to this event...they feed you very little, and the food itself is cafeteria grade.  The breadsticks were stale, the eggrolls were soggy, and the main dishes were terrible: the salmon was overcooked and dry, and the sides were simply steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes likely from a boxed mix.  The other main dish, stuffed chicken, was also dry, and the stuffing was a mixture overwhelmed by creamed cheese. The highlight of the meal was a dessert was a chocolate cake that was moist and creamy.\n\nThe show itself was somewhat entertaining, if you're willing to dumb down your humor and lower your overall expectations.  Many lines in the actual show were stolen from popular movies, so they were funny but unoriginal.  The story dragged on for too long...started at 6:30 and ended at 10.  Dinner wasn't served until about 8/8:30.\n\nThe host took every opportunity possible to point out the bar in the corner, which charged $8 for a mixed drink or cheap wine.\n\nI've always wanted to try one of these detective dinners, and now that I have gone, I won't ever go back or recommend it to anyone else.  Maybe it will entertain a group of children, or a group of conservatives who think that these things are an adventure. Even with the groupon deal, this \""show\"" wasn't worth the money.  Save your cash and go to vegas for a real show, or go try a couple of quality restaurants instead."
1,We love Earl of Sandwich. Our favorites are tomato bisque soup (with croutons) and the tuna melt. Their baked goods are also very tasty. Breakfast sandwiches are good but small.
0,"Walked in and stood at the counter for 6 minutes. No one ever came up, 2 people walked by the register.  No one said one word to me, so I walked out. Its 9:20. There was 2 cars total in the drive through and no one eating inside. No excuse for piss poor service. . I walked right next door and ate at Mcalisters."

1,"I'd have to say that in the course of five minutes I spent five dollars, gained five pounds, added five inches to my waistline, and took five years off of my life.  But I knew that going in and did it anyway.  Where, you ask, can you also clog your arteries and love every precious minute of the experience?  Lucky Boy is the place.\n\nWe ordered the quarter pound Lucky International with fries.  I added bacon, green chili and cheese to mine.  It was pure heartburn; I mean heaven, at first bite.  All of the Lucky Boy burgers include lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions, but you can hold any or all of the included condiments.  The Lucky International also includes 1000 island dressing. Was it messy?  Absolutely!  Would I do it again?  Absolutely!  The fries were amazing.  Real cut potatoes with the perfect amount of salt and crispiness.   I also had the small shake, which was really quite large.  They were really good.  You can mix up to two of the 14 flavors for the same price.  But I'm a purist so I stuck with chocolate.  They also have hotdogs, corndogs and grilled cheese for the little ones.  If you're really in a hurry, you can always order to go and they have a drive-thru as well.\n\nThere are three reasons why Lucky Boy only gets four out of five stars.\n\n1.  Every little thing you add is an extra, including refills, but it's so inexpensive it's not really a big deal.\n\n2. It was very warm inside.  No A/C.  Maybe that's why the prices are so low. (*Edit to add they do have fans and evaporative cooling so it wasn't too terribly bad.)\n\n3. No restroom to wash my hands afterwards.  These burgers are very messy!\n\nIf you ever need a cheap eats night, this would be a great place for it."
0,"Place is pretty big with no vendors.  Alot of spaces are open and the building has horrible smell filling the air, almost like a combo of body odor and century old clothes.  I was here to get info on vendor/renting space but there is absolutely no shoppers and experience was awful.  I am get the idea that building owners/management of the swap meet must be pretty bad with all the spaces open and no renters.  \nMy personal first time experience...while walking up to the office to get info  I witnessed something that no shopper or person should have to go through.  So There was middle eastern lady that was working or managing in the office yelling horrible things at a shopper who lost a child about how horrible a person she was and that she was not going to take her child until the police arrived. Whoa! Little kid was ok and mother was in tears!  I totally felt bad for the mother because we all have had that horrible experience of losing a kid in non familiar place and just want to comfort your child.  I was almost about to say something but totally shocked when security with turbans  started harassing the whole family all the way out of the building.  PRETTY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE AND WILL NOT GO BACK TO SHOP OR SELL WHATSOEVER!  i am sure that poor family won't be returning either and must I say DON'T LOOSE YOUR CHILD THERE. GEESH!"
0,"Worst experience I have ever had getting a facial! First off she put a cream on my face that started to burn, I advised her it was burning and she took her time taking it off. Then she was on her phone (texting) majority of the time. My appt. Was for an hour she was done less than 45 minutes and most of that time she was on her phone. She put a lotion on my face and told me I was done. I felt like I was getting punked! That's how bad it was! I would never ever recommend this place for a facial!"
0,"I've been going to Pink Lotus for about two years and the quality of the service has decreased finally to the point of deciding never to go back there. I used to go for nails, but decided to stop that about a year ago when I kept having to have them fixed ever few days.\nSo a couple weeks ago I went in for a pedicure. I sat down and the girl who usually does an incredibly lackluster job on my feet started in. i was allowed to dip my left foot in the water, but not soak it before she started ripping cuticles from my toe nails. three of my toes ended up bleeding and it just went downhill from there. the polish was uneven, and I ended up developing ingrown toenails in two toes after the so-called pedicure. \nNEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!"
1,Awesomely good

0,"After I booked the room, I've been harassed by its marketing phone call every day even though I'm on the Do Not Call list. I called back and asked them to remove my name from their list, the agent told me that legally they have 30 days to do it! Ridiculous!!\n\nThe room was just OK. Nothing fancy about it. The good part is it doesn't have an casino full with cigarette smoke.\n\nI came here during CES and I wanted to call a cab to head to my meeting. The bell boy told me that no taxi is available for the next 30 minutes but suggested me to take a shuttle that they arranged for CES attendees and the fare is $10. However, the next day, he gave me the same speech but the driver asked for $15 instead. I'm wondering if Polo Towers getting a cut out of it.\n\nI asked for late check out. The front desk told me that I have to check out by 10:30 AM! \n\nI've stayed many places but never heard of late check out to be that early. Usually around noon or after noon."
1,"Super tasty breakfast spot just off the strip. Their menu is like a newspaper and is a couple pages long so there is something for everyone! Our server, Karla was very friendly and the service is fast!"
0,This place is horrible!!! The groomers were so rude and unprofessional when I walked in. Then to top it off a groomer by the name of Allison chopped the hair on my dogs ear off. Did not even say anything to me about it until I got my dog home and noticed it. If she cut just a little more she would have cut the tip of his hair off. For 50$ and to be in Tivoli Village (nicer Las Vegas) it was not worth it! service grooming and groomers suck and the place it self is not even up to par. I would NOT recommend anyone to take there dog here. I only ranked it one star because I had to if it was up to me NO STARS.
1,"Amazing On Tuesdays, great wine tasting. Staff is friendly and knowledgable. Everything that I had (bruschetta and crab cakes) were above average."
0,I have seen other cirque de sole shows and this was not cirque de sole. We did not enjoy it at all. The acts were nothing special and it was not a show. Save your money and go see a real show. The O or The Beatles were amazing. I didn't mind the nudity it just wasn't a show that impressed me. Save your money!!!!
0,"I have nearly been hit by these buses, probably about a half dozen times.  They are assholes.  I've also seen them run red lights at least twice and not the whole \""yellow...yellow...red!?! aw crap\"" kinda running.\n\nThe last time I rode the bus someone must have shit their pants.  I blame the old guy across from me.  It was amusing to watch everyone get off at the next stop, but extremely inconvenient to walk the extra distance to class.  I haven't been on since.  \n\n*ASU has free bus passes for all students, which is the only thing that makes it worth riding.  Go to the bottom floor of the towers where you buy parking passes and get yourself a semester pass."
1,"In the city of excess, some jasmine tea and a steamy bowl of pho is a very welcome thing.\n\nIt's not cheap - I think my bowl of Vietnamese Seafood Pho was about $18 - but it was soothing, aromatic (lots of cilantro, just the way I like it), and delicious (and huge, with large chunks of fresh seafood).  It was actually one of the best bowls of pho I've had (mind you I live in NYC, which is notoriously lacking in solid Vietnamese cuisine, but still).  The shrimp and pork shumai ($9) were gorgeously plump and tasty - an excellent way to start the meal.  And the Fresh Young Coconut ($8) was a terrific way to end.\n\nService was a little slow, and my waitress wouldn't serve me congee because she didn't think I would like it (I beg to differ, but no sense arguing with the person in control of preventing you from passing out from hunger).  The menu is vast, not for the indecisive, and a little schizophrenic, drawing inspiration not from one country, but four (Thailand, Japan, China, Japan).  Simply decorated, it is not flashy or fancy.  We were there early afternoon, and there seemed to be more executives on their lunch break than hotel guests (a good sign?  I think so).  Overall, a solid choice with great food.  It lacks the razzmatazz that personifies so much of Vegas, but offers a nice, simple hunger solution following several days (and nights) of gluttony."
1,"I love Chelsea's Kitchen. It has been my favorite restaurant ever since I moved to Arizona. This atmosphere is so great, it feels like home! Please try this restaurant, I know you'll love it too."
1,I'm addicted! Everyone there is so freakin nice. And Maui dogs are delicious.
0,"I didn't want to give a not-so-stellar review...but it was too easy. EVERYTHING fellow yelpers say is true. SLOW service. We sat at our table for over 15 minutes before I stopped someone to find out who our server was. ANNOYING. I am a server so I'm pretty lenient, but this was unacceptable. The fish tank? GONE! Might wanna put that in somewhere on the website. The whole reason we went there and my nephew was heartbroken :(  Ice cream for 4 kids and 1 round of cocktails for 4 adults....$$$$$$  PASS!"
1,"This place is probably one of my FAVORITE places to get breakfast!\n\nMy friend brought me here for the first time a few years ago and I loved it! Everything on the menu is amazing! The last time I went I got the Banana nut bread french toast. It was delicious. One of my other favorites is their corned beef hash. But my other recommendations? Everything! I've also tried their Pecan pancakes which are delicious. I really want to try their crepes and that fried egg bagel next time I'm in or even their lunch menu sounds really good. \n\nThe only downer for me is that it's quite far for me, but well worth the drive! &  If you go on the weekends there's going to be a wait since it does get pretty busy. I might be writing another review for it once I try their lunch menu. =)"
0,"I have been in here 3 times in the 13 years I have lived in proximity to it.\n\nFirst time to replace a rear tire that had been stolen from my bike. Turns out it is way cheaper to buy a new bike than replace that tire. Nonetheless, they were pretty aloof about the whole thing.\n\nSecond time I was looking for a nice cruiser with gears and grip brakes. They had one...but not cheap at all! They were pretty uncaring as well.\n\nThird, my buddy's Schwinn was stolen on my watch. This was the time that they were the nicest to me. However, he decided to get a different bike. The replacement was expensive.\n\nI have not had reason to head back there...don't know that I ever will. One not so bad time does not make me loyal."
1,"I eat here because I work down the street, I like this mexican food more than any other place like it. It's just very good and authentic tasting. I have had many friends come with me to this place and they agree, the food is very very good and is better than any other place like it."
1,I took a trip to Long Beach recently and tried Cambodian food for the first time in Cambodia town. I came back home to Phoenix and had to get some more! Reathrey Sekong satisfies the longing!  I always get the katheaw noodle soup and one of their amazing boba drinks.  I'm so glad I found this place!
1,"Crepes are not the best, but they are quite good and at a reasonable price.\n\nI tried two kinds when I visited: the nutella/strawberry/banana, and the peach/almond\n\nI added condensed milk to the peach/almond. You can add extra \""add-ons\"" for 50 cents."
1,Stopped here for a bite last Monday and loved everything about it. Off the beaten path so a spot for regulars instead of the tourist eateries around the corner. highly recommend Vallier Bistro.
1,"The Room:\nNice, clean and modern standard. The ends of the wooden hangers can be sanded slightly more. Cozy king bed which I've woken up in different positions. It had hints of smoke, despite being a non-smoking room (some guests, I tell ya...). They offered to try the smoke scent removal machine a few hours; I declined. Easy climate controls.\n\nThe Service:\nCheck-in was nice and friendly. Check-out was a smidge longer than I thought. There was an extra charge in the room and I didn't even use any extra service. It took the dude awhile just to figure it out and fix.\n\nExtras:\nThe guest fitness room was great. You can do just about anything in there from dips to pull-ups to jogging. Also stocked with towels, water and TV."
1,went there on my 21 st BD  it was so fun the girls were good looking go drunk they dont serve alcohal.
1,"In need of something with very sexy fuel economy because there are two gas guzzlers in my garage, I make the rounds at the used car departments at large dealerships in Tempe, Scottsdale, Phoenix and Peoria.\n\nI've got a cash deal to offer for something cheap and economical and I want to be around $13k out the door. \n\nBait and switch at one dealership. Astronomical retail prices at another. Nothing in the inventory w/ under 100k miles in my price range at another place. Trying too hard to convince me to finance when I have cash and lying about attempting to run a credit app at the last dealership I visited. Private party deals prove to be flakes, want to trade vehicles or total BS.\n\nAfter two weeks of searching, I was discouraged. Then I researched Hertz Car Sales program. I did A LOT of reading, looked over a ton of information and customer feedback and decided that it's the best option for my particular needs.\n\nThey price their vehicles for a no-haggle deal. They offer coupons for $300- $1000 off the purchase price online. You get enough Hertz Gold points for a week's rental if you buy here, too. \n\nScott was great from the start of our email communication to when I drove off of the lot with my new (new to me) and very miserly 34 mpg average car. \n\nHe still owes me some floor mats and a small interior trim piece that were missing from the car at the time of sale, so I will be following up this review with that outcome, but I was shocked at the great selection of cars and how easy this transaction was.\n\nHertz should work well for you if A) you want a no-frills second or third/fourth car B) you don't mind a car with (relatively) higher mileage C) you hate the nebulous pricing and car salesman/woman games D) you have your own cash/financing."
0,"I go to this particular Rita's 1-2 times a week and I usually have great customer service with the exception of one employee named Ashley.  She in not pleasant at all and has horrible customer service. She even rolled her eyes and shook her head upon me entering the store yesterday,,,,,Totally Unacceptable! I don't understand how the owners can allow this type of employee to continue this horrific behavior, especially with the reputation of Rita's. I have written a complaint as well as called the owner to see if she can speak with Ashley about her poor work ethics so that I can continue to visit this store and have an enjoyable experience. I will let you all know the outcome."
0,The past office itself is okay but some of the employees there are morons. I hate having to interact with them.  Why after 6 years would you ask a regular customer whom you know by name for id and make you sign back of your cc? It makes no sense and is irritating.
0,"I just received horrible service. The lady who did my nails dug her own nails into mine as she roughly drilled my nails down. Even after the first two times that she painfully nicked me with the electric drill she stared off at her phone and nicked me twice more. When I asked for a color suggestion, she just stared at me and told me to figure it out and said she couldn't suggest a color. And my acrylic looks half done. The worst experience at a nail salon. I have no idea what went on in her day....but she took it out on my nails."
1,"I was thinking there was no way I'd find good pizza in Nevada (at least since Cosa Nostra gave up its casinos). This pizzeria proved me decisively wrong. It's some of the best true New York style pizza I've had. The slices was large and foldable with excellent crust. The fresh mozzarella was great as was the pepperoni. Everything had a strong & delicious taste. \n\nThus, down a hallway on the third floor of a Vegas shopping center, I found the best pizza I've had outside of New York & Italy."
0,So I had this when I just visited back to Vegas. Tried the Baby Back Ribs and the Mac and Cheese. I didn't love it. It was o.k. I really enjoy TC's RIB Crib more.  Nice place inside and friendly staff.
1,"I love this salon!  I used to go to another one, but ever since my hubby got me a gift card for my birthday last year this has been my go to salon :) Everyone is so nice and friendly. They always make me feel so welcomed, and I've never had a bad experience with any of their techs :)"
0,"Not anymore.\n\n20 minutes to check out, as only the self-checkouts were open and available.  5 people cruising around in front of the closed \""person-operated\"" registers but no manned register opened for over 15 minutes.   25 people waiting in line behind 6 who were at the self-checkout?\n\nWTF?  \n\nIt's Sunday evening, too many people in line and whomever is in charge does not have someone open a register?\n\nBy the time I got to the self-checkout, the ice cream I came to get was pretty much a waste.  I paid for milk, OJ and broccoli, but left the ice cream.\n\nWhile you are the closest to home, you are CERTAINLY not the best.  You have lost my business."
0,"Sunday brunch sucks... No macaroon, lousy dishes, and weird tastes shrimp. Worst lunch buffet ever."
1,"Since we always stay at the Venetian when we go to Vegas, I've hit this spot many times. Food in consistently good, there are a few items that are really good (spicy ying nan noodle, beef rice noodle (add a little soy sauce) and the dim sum). It's also conveniently located close to the poker room. Good hangover food. \nThe service is also consistently slow. It's your typical Chinese restaurant service, so when you need something you just need to be vocal!"
1,"Knowledgeable and helpful staff.\nHUGE facility with everything you could want by way of aquarium (saltwater and/or freshwater) equipment and supplies, as well as a huge selection of fish.\nAlso a decent reptile section.\nThe Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated has a couple huge aquariums. The freshwater is set up and has had some fishes for years. The saltwater is notably bigger - and not currently set up. He wanted some new fishes and some plants for the freshwater tank, and this is his store of choice.\nHe chose plants and a couple Baal sharks, and suggested I pick a fish I liked. I don't know much about fish, but really liked the shape and grace of the black angelfish, so he got one for me.\nLooking forward to years of fun and lots of leaning about aquariums - and happy to know Ocean Floor is nearby for all the fishy needs we may have."
1,"Went here for a Spring Training game on Saturday, not one complaint!  Parking was only 5 dollars, we got great seats for only $20 a piece.  Everything was clean,  the food was great.  Next time maybe I'll venture further than a hot dog, but it was a great hot dog at that!  \n\nWashing it down with a nice cool budweiser on a spring afternoon, it doesn't get much better than this...."
1,"The place is always packed during lunch, for great reasoning, their food is amazing even during the lunch rush, they never drop the ball.\n\nThe people taking your order are very friendly &I always get your order right. Even though they have so many orders rolling in at once & they have to move quick the quality of food is still great!! \n\nDefinitely recommend if you want great noodles during lunch. The Japanese pan noodle with tofu is great."
0,"The reviews are so glowing. Unfortunately, my experience wasn't so great. It might have been because my emotions were all over the place that day.\n\nThe veterinarian was good; she was told me ahead of time how much the x-rays would cost for my cat. I obliged to the cost as well as set up a payment plan for them. It turned out my cat had broken his leg, and the surgery to fix it would cost $2500+. She gave me time to think. I just sat there and cried. I couldn't afford to do this, even with payments.\n\nThe vet tech came in with my cat's prescriptions. She didn't ask, \""What's wrong?\"" even if it's obvious I'm upset over something. Instead, she just went through the motions of telling me how to give my cat pain medicine and demonstrated how to draw it up in a syringe. She left the room without saying anything else. I cried even more. I'm sure the staff has seen these kinds of situations many times, but wow; she never even looked at me.\n\nI went to pay at the front desk, and the vet tech came out, said \""He will be OK\"", looked down at the cat carrier, and then walked away. No, my cat didn't end up OK. I had to give him up to the humane society because I couldn't afford to give him the help he needed. \n\nI'm in healthcare; when I see someone upset or crying, I at least acknowledge their feelings. I can't always do anything about it, but even an open-ended \""I'm sorry\"" would have helped some. \n\nThe surgeon spoke to me over the phone, telling me my options. He sounded like he cared, and he never even saw my cat like the other staff did. \n\nThe staff is competent; but aside from the surgeon, they lack basic customer service and compassion."
1,"Awesome place to stay.  From the reception at the desk to the breakfasts and dinners.  The people are awesome!   I can't wait to come back.  Michael, Amy, Alma, Angela, Mike,   You all ROCK!!!!  Oh yeah also they help you with any of your questions.  Kind, professional, and fun!   Great location."
1,their $5 carne asade torta has a full avocado in it and great bread!\n\ni don't care for their elote--it's served as a gloppy mess in a cup instead of on the cob!
1,"I have been to Distrito 3 times now. And every time their food is some of the tastiest I've had. Their service however, leaves the customer often a little puzzled. The servers seem disenchanted and as if you're putting them out by dining there.  It's odd because they have a good knowledge of the menu, and will advise you on your order if asked, but with zero enthusiasm. It's just strange. I've had the pleasure of being greeted by a manager once and the head chef came to our table one evening, both were incredibly pleasant and appreciative of the business. Why don't they hire happier servers?? Anywhoo... \n\nDrink-wise, I'd recommend their house margarita and red sangria, but skip the specialty cocktails as they are pricey and did not impress.  Their guac is really good, but be prepared to spend $10 and share; it's a lot of guac! Food-wise, I recommend their mahi tacos and the queso fundido... Fan-freakin-tastic!  For the mahi tacos, house made tortillas are topped with a lovely piece of fried mahi mahi, slice of avocado, pickled cabbage and a dollop of spicy aioli. It is an explosion of flavor. The queso fundido is truly one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. Their ribs are also fall-off-the-bone amazing and the nachos are everything nachos were meant to be. On their sides menu, I'd have to push the corn as it was different from any I've ever had before. \n\nUpdate: They have a happy hour now!  House margs, guac and a couple other things marked down to around $5 every day from 3-6pm.  Definitely a steal deal!"
0,"Nothing to rave about in the way of their smoothies.  Also make sure to check the nutrition label before ordering a lot of their smoothies are loaded with calories, don't assume it is healthy because it has fruit. I also think they are very pricey.  I would rather go and get a fresh juice for the prices.  They do stock a lot of other healthy snacks and such which is convenient, not sure you would need more calories after the smoothie though.  I didn't look at the prices of the snacks so I can not comment on that.  \nWhen I went they were having a special on one of the add ins and the girl forgot to take the discount off my order before charging me then seemed like it was a hassle for her to have to fix the mistake.  \nI wouldn't go back here for the smoothies."
0,"I was super stoked when I realized there was a BBQ joint close to my office... too bad it's just \""OK\"".\n\nI couldn't really tell the difference in taste or looks between the pulled pork and the brisket.  Seriously.  It was weird.  The spicy BBQ sauce is garbage and literally looks and tastes like Ketchup with hot sauce added.  Bunk.  The Lemonade was, surprisingly, very watery and bland.  The side of beans was OK, nothing special.  Next!"
1,"This is such a LARGE buffet!  Probably the largest I've ever seen so there are lots of options.  That being said, the food was acceptable but not outstanding.  The good thing is that it was fresh, not old.  The bad thing is that it was average tasting.  There's nothing wrong with that when there's so much!  That's why 3 stars.  \nWe got the Champagne brunch, not a bad value for $32 per person.  Our waiter was on the refills too!  \nOur server was fantastic!  He earned this place a whole additional star, bumping it up to 4 stars.  :)  He was very nice and responsive to our every want and need.  I would definitely recommend this place, just don't expect gourmet food."
1,"Nice local beers on tap, good wine and great mac and cheese.  My burger was well above average.  If you're in the airport and looking for an adult beverage and some bar food, this is a great option."
0,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Elara because his best friend of 20 years was an owner with the resort. His bestie (an investment banker) booked the room for us. When we arrived, we were so impressed with the location of the resort on the strip and we were also originally pleased with guest services at the front desk, concierge, and the timeshare desk. (The good experience only lasted for one day.) Between my boyfriend and I, we make over $200k. We were genuinely considering purchasing a timeshare with the resort so therefore we booked a presentation with the staff. The next day (day of presentation) my boyfriend forgot that he had an important business-related conference call. I contacted the sales staff to explain that we have to reschedule the presentation. (By the way, we gave them a $20 deposit which we agreed to lose if we didn't attend the presentation.) Later that day, we went to concierge because we were looking to book David Copperfield tix. (Let me explain that we already attended the Michael Jackson One Cirque Du Soleil-which was amazing and we only had fine dining the day before and were planning on going to Gordon Ramsay's Steakhouse.... So we weren't too concerned about spending money, but that doesn't mean we don't search out deals.) The man at the Concierge desk appeared to be very annoyed when we approached his desk and he asked what he could do to help us (with a very smug attitude). My boyfriend stated we were interested in going to the Copperfield show and asked if Concierge could assist with any deals. Before my boyfriend could complete his question, the man cut him off and said, \""We can do 7th row for $107/person and that's all I got for you Sir.\"" So then my boyfriend proceeded to ask another question and was again cut off with a response of \""That's all we have, we want you to have good seats.\"" Again, he had such a smug, condescending attitude. I politely stated that we would think about it. My boyfriend and I looked at each other like wow! We also went the gift/convenience shop located in the lobby where I wanted to purchase a shirt I observed on display. I saw a pink shirt for $17 but realized I wanted the gray one instead (the exact same shirt just different color). First of all, when we walked into the store, the woman behind the counter gave us a very cold look. When we approached the counter, she was very nice to the customer in front of us, but when it was time to service us, she came off very rude, cold, and awkward. Anyhow, I gave her the grey shirt and she said that'll be $32. I was surprised and explained to her that I thought it was $17 because the pink shirt was $17. She rudely showed me the price tag instead of explaining the difference. \n\nMy boyfriend is normally the calm one that let's everything go. Not this time... He was so disgusted with the Concierge behavior as well as the store clerk's behavior that he decided to call the front desk and ask to speak with a supervisor. The woman at the desk asked why we needed to speak with a supervisor to which he responded, \""I'm so disappointed with a couple of the services we received and their condescending attitudes toward us. I think it's ridiculous to treat people this way especially when these people are genuinely considering becoming owners.\"" The woman placed him on hold for about 3 mins (which is kind of a long time if you really consider it). After 3 mins, she came back on the phone and said that the manager was assisting other guests and would call us back. By this time, my boyfriend and I were ready for dinner at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. We waited two hours before making reservations so that we could speak to a manager who NEVER called us back. We were so done and we will not purchase timeshare with this place EVER!! We also read other \""bad reviews\"" of this place and it's sad that our experience also falls in line with the other unfortunate ones. My boyfriend can't wait to tell his bestie about the service of this place! If you could help it, don't stay here!!"
0,"Our order:\nSml Caesar Salad---$8\n\nMy daughter said \""it did not taste good.\""  It was a Caesar Salad; so, the dressing or something else was off.\n\nRoot Beer---$3.50\n\nComes from a bottle.  Pretty high mark up for a regular bottle of root beer.  Really?\n\nHot Chocolate---$2 (x2)\n\nOkay hot chocolate that comes in a paper cup and plastic lid.  Pretty expensive for instant hot chocolate.\n\n2 Seared Scallops & 4 Shrimp (they do not tell you how many you get) w/ mac & cheese and garlic mashed potatoes---$24\n\nShrimp had pretty good taste, and the scallops had a nice sear, but the main course was really skimpy.  Both sides were very bland.\n\nSalmon with Crab (sides were Garlic Mash and Braised Mushrooms).  \n\nFish was bland.  Garlic Mash bland. The mushrooms were atrocious. \""Absolutely disgusting\""\n\n*they charged me $2 for a soda/tea I did not reviece.  With horrible food like this, they need that $2 more than me.\n\nWe will never come back here again.  \n\n\""We should have gone to 5 & Diner instead\"""
1,Everything about our meal was great. The pizza was delicious and there were lots of toppings options. The service was also great - they called us when our table was ready and our waitress was friendly and had helpful recommendations.
1,"I came here with no intent of buying a mattress, just lay on a few. Faith was a huge help and wound up selling me one. Got a killer deal, and same day delivery. If you are looking for a mattress, come see Faith!\n\n--update--\n\nDelivery guys were on time, quick, and even set up the frame so we were ready to go. To my surprise I found my frame and the mattress protector for half price on the Mattress Firm website. I would think that the website and stores would be in sync, but they aren't. I will be going back to see if they can make good on that tomorrow, I do not foresee an issue but if there is I will surely update. Called around to a few other mattress stores and I got my mattress and box springs for around $600 less than everywhere I called quoted on the phone. I feel I got a great deal on that part, just not stoked about the $150 extra cost in the add ons. \n\nI am out of here, time to go get a good nights sleep on my new Stearns and Foster!\n\n--update 2--\n\nManager promised to credit the difference in cost on the add ons. After calling a couple days I felt that he was avoiding me as he kept giving me excuses of how busy they are. On the fifth or sixth day I went in as it is harder to avoid someone face to face. He seemed to be avoiding again, but I got him to give me a dollar amount to be credited. He said it was posted on the second day after purchase but may take two weeks. When I checked my account the following week it was there and sure enough was sent on the second day after purchase but took a few days to clear. I am unsure why he was acting so dodgy when he had already posted it. Point is, they keep their five stars. I would not hesitate to deal with them again in the future."
1,"It's always Delish!! The pancakes are The best!!!  My mother flipped over the grits, and we ate from NY!!  LoL. Enjoy !!"
0,"Worst customer service ever! asked me to wait for 30 mins, after a long wait of 1hr they asked me wait another 1hour and also suggested us go to another restaurant.. And the reason they gave is \""technical issues\"". Wish yelp allows me to give a 0.25 on review."
1,"This past summer i attended the stadium and have to say it is really nice, the roof retracts and that was pretty cool to see and experience, the staff is really nice and the facility is very clean. A/C was freaking awesome since PHX heat is a bit too much to handle on some days, at least my time while in Phx.\n\nSeating in my section was a bit weird, seats were in a angle and sorta tight, i am sure there may be other areas much more comfortable, but time will only tell since i am sure this will not be my last time i attend this ballpark... \n\nGo Dodgers!"
0,"This place is HORRIBLE! Too pricey for the lack of freshness of the sashimis! It's actually laughable how this place garners customers. Their sashimi special is nothing special; slices are thin and small, and definitely not fresh. Granted, it's on the strip, but it shouldn't suck this much my goodness. Servers weren't attentive and also not knowledgable with their menu. Horrible horrible horrible."
0,"This place is mediocre, it's the typical salon that's found every half block. When they say the wait is 5 min, they mean at least 30. Most of the time I'm satisfied with the end result. One time I showed up a few minutes before they opened, as do some of the other customers, and when I asked for a fill,  they put my name on the list, told me that they had another person on the way in, and then a couple minutes later they told me that they weren't open yet however there were already people getting pedicures and manicures.  Cash is a little less expensive. I keep going here because I haven't found a better place."
0,"Unfortunately my husband and I never even got the chance to eat here. We called about 5 days ahead to make a reservation for Saturday and were told the restaurant was booked. That was understandable; we waited a little too late to call as it was a last minute trip to The Strip. When we got to the Paris hotel, we decided to walk past the restaurant to check it out. My husband is in culinary school and is impressed with Gordon Ramsey's high standards of service. The line for us happened when we were outside the restaurant looking in. A couple walked past and the hostess at the stand outside asked them if they'd like reservations to eat there that night, on Saturday, when this couple didn't even approach the stand. With such high standards, we did not expect to be denied a reservation when they obviously had space available, as evidenced by the hostess asking passers by to eat there! Left us with a bad taste in our mouths; my husband was very disappointed. Won't be going to a Ramsey establishment any time soon. Ate at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar instead."
0,I have to say I'm very disappointed at this restaurant... Came here because I used to watch Guy on the food Channel all the time and wanted to give it a shot.. We order the famous Mac&Cheese burger and the chicken taco.. The Mac&Cheese burger just tasted weird I think it's because they didn't cook the Mac&Cheese right.. I can barely taste the cheese and the meat didn't get any taste to it either.. The price is higher than it deserves.. I learned my lesson now that if I want to get a burger I'll just go back to Gorden Ramsay Burger in Planet Hollywood.. Tastes so much better and actually cheaper.. The chicken taco is just ok.. Not something I would be coming back for.. I give this place a 2 stars because the server was pretty nice and that's about it.
1,So delicious! The creme brule crepe was amazballs! They even have gluten free batter for my wife! Yum!
1,This is a small but good location close to home. Love the Rita ice!
1,"This place is great & is 24/7. I love their Pot stickers, spring rolls, egg rolls and their  Luc-lac steak. Plus their plain rice noodle Pho. Yum and I've never had bad service so that's a plus and our waiter Brian was excellent."
0,"Not a great variety of food. A majority of the people that dine here are the elderly. The menu outside is just sad. Resorting to listing sauces/gravy/rice as food items to take up space should be a sign. The main ethnic food here is Mexican followed by Chinese. I just stuck with the Chinese food, which isn't great at all. The deep-fried pork pot stickers are the closest thing to authentic. Beware, prime rib is an additional cost! The hot meats available were baked ham and roast beef. The roast beef wasn't too shabby and the ham was sort of acceptable. Desserts are the generic cakes. Lots of sugar-free options. i decided to try the rainbow sherbet ice cream. The lady scooped me 3 scoops of it and by the time I was back at the table, a layer of liquid has already emerged at the bottom of the bowl. Melted ice cream is gross, but tasted ok. \n\nService was slow. I had to get beverage refills constantly myself. Good thing the machine was steps away from the table. Restrooms are located outside of the buffet behind where the cocktails are served inside the buffet (hope that makes some sense)."
1,"I came here years ago on a whim driving by and was kinda excited to find this place again after moving to this side of town.\n\nIt is a Kosher restaurant so the hours are not what we are used to in our normal daily Vegas, however the food is worth the wait and the drive.  Kosher is a BIG meaning and covers a lot of knowledge. I will not begin to explain but a bit of reading on the subject wouldn't hurt.\n\nThe food here is amazing, I remember asking my Man if we could drive the 30 minutes to go get the \""Shawarma\"" no go.  So when we moved in this direction and I found it again it has kinda become my cheat day, not that is is bad for you but OH So Good!  I believe the Shawarma combo is the best for me I love the long roasted meat shaved into your sandwich.  I also really love the falafels buy a couple for 50cent a piece with a bit of Tahini, amazing fried goodness!  \n\nThe service is not really quick everything takes a bit to cook (because it is Kosher) and the prices are bit high, but most really great places like this are and there is a reason.  The reasons are prep, time, seasons and accountability.  I feel the safest place to eat in the world is here because they take it so serious.  \n\nSo the portions are huge that makes up for the price, the price isn't bad I thought... The meat is moist and delicious and plenty of sauce and veggies to make it all rhyme.  ask for the hot sauce but if you are weary about it ask for it on the side I ask for it lightly and I like heat if that says anything! LOL"
0,"While staying at the South Point Casino, I decided to go to the Garden Buffet for breakfast.  To my surprise, they were already closed for breakfast at 10AM and were preparing for lunch!  Are you kidding me??  This is Las Vegas.  A good chunk of people don't even role out of bed until after 10 in Vegas!  Determined to try the Buffet, I made it back there the next morning.  Just making it in time, I got to try it out finally.  They did have a nice selection and the price for the buffet breakfast wasn't bad.  However the food was nothing memorable.  Overall, 2.5 stars."
0,"The baguette had a great texture, but the flavor wasn't there.  I wasn't a big fan of the macarons either (but I don't know what good macarons taste like...).  The croissant was good, but I've had better.\n\nGood seating area upstairs though."
0,"Worst customer service! I don't know if the guy that was helping me was managment, but he decided to carry on a conversation with an off the clock employee while taking my order and got it all wrong. Went one more time a few weeks later and ordered their chicken fried steak special for $2.99. I know it's only $2.99 but the chicken tasted like it had been sitting a little too long and there was not enough gravy on both the chicken or mashed potatoes. Will never return to this location again!"
0,"Pasta was terrible, pizza was horrible. This is a place that uses tourists ignorance and charges an arm and leg.  Stay away."
0,"If you like sugar and bread combined then this is your kind of place.    Stopped in for lunch recently with my husband since we were craving a good sub sandwich and was hoping Firehouse would deliver.  In my opinion it failed miserably.   I ordered the \""Firehouse Hero Sub\"" which includes smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, roast beef, melted provolone.  Hubby had the \""New York Steamer\"" which includes corned beef brisket, pastrami, melted provolone.     We ordered both subs \""fully involved\"" which includes mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a dill spear on the side.    When my sub was delivered they forgot the mustard.    The sub looked good but that's where it ended.   The quality of the meats was just terrible.   The Virginia honey ham was so sweet I thought I was going into glucose overload.   That's all I could taste of the sub.  SUGAR!!   Granted a honey ham can be a little on the sweet side but not like this.   Husband's sub had no flavor.   Simply poor quality meats all the way around.   You can get a better sub at Fry's or Basha's using the Boars Head meats.   I would not recommend this place."
0,"Garbage, garbage, garbage. \n\nWhy does everyone hate their cable company? Because the american cable companies have a monopoly and no reason to care. What are you gonna do? Switch to DSL? LOL! -that's what cox thinks. \n\nI've had cox cable for YEARS and consistently horrible service. I won't be surprised if I get disconnected while writing this review. \n\nA year ago cox claimed (as they claim with every customer) that it's your modems fault. It's NEVER on cox's side. So I bought a new modem. Same problems. \n\nTV service is spotty, glitchy. Shows random pixelated pictures every few minutes. Just this morning I turned on the TV and it was like a remix of the show I was watching. Just d-d-d-d-d-d-d-do it. Literally. \n\nI think I might give century link a try. Too bad verizon doesn't offer unlimited wifi with their jackpack. I'd love an alternative. Why is it so difficult to just get reliable internet?"
1,"Cheap, Authentic, Delicious. Thats all you need to know! Great place to get your produce and to have some real mexican food! I love Cardenas!"
1,I love this place. My wife & I visit here every couple of weekends. One of our favorite places. The food is flavorful & will not disappoint. The staff is always friendly & the environment is welcoming. By far SOME OF THE BEST MARGARITAS IN LAS VEGAS!!!
1,"Probably one of the better buffets in Vegas. But maybe just 3 3/4 stars at most. \n\nQuite a drive away from the strip, but I think it's worth (the drive) it. I remember the days when weekend seafood brunch/dinner was 30ish. My recent visit it was up to 40+ already. Geez. At least there wasn't a line, but that might also be because of the new price point. \n\nI only really go in for the snow crab legs. They're precut now, sliced in half, so it's a little different. Not as fun and gratifying than cracking the legs and having to work for in in my opinion lol. But it does make it easier. \n\nThey have an awesome dessert bar, most of the desserts are okay - mind you they might have been sitting out for a while. My go-to is usually creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and gelato."
0,"I have tried the majority of chinese restaurants in Montreal, and as a taiwanese born, i have to say that my family of 6 did not enjoy the food here for it being overly heavy on salt and spices. We ordered water boiled fish, cumin beef, pickled vegetable chicken, seaweed, garlic pork and EVERYTHING was way too spicy despite asking for mild spices. The service is acceptable as in most chinese places, but poor by caucasian standard. Needless to say i will not be going back."
0,"Granted I just got off a 6 hour flight from Hawaii, but I wasn't so jet-lagged that I could not help noticing the hostess on 11/01/14, circa 0930 hours, so OBVIOUSLY DISCRIMINATING against us. \n\nUpon being led to a 2-seater table in the middle of the walkway in the restaurant, I politely asked if we could sit in a 4-seater on the side of the room. The restaurant was not filled. The young brunette hostess told us that she is \""NOT ALLOWED TO SEAT 2 PEOPLE IN 4-SEATERS ON A SATURDAY MORNING.\"" Being that I was with my 78 year old non-confrontational Asian Mother, I did not persist in asking for another table. Our server was very sweet, as all the servers have been in my past 4-5 visits to Egg Works. \n\nAs we filled our stomachs with hot coffee, I became more and more lucid and then noticed that the 4-seater tables to the left of us and behind us had two people at each of them. I then observed Miss Hostess bringing another couple to a 4-seater across from me. The restaurant NEVER filled up while we were there. \n\nYeah, the banana muffin is pretty delicious after a long plane ride, but I'll think twice about going to this Egg Works next time I'm in town and go some place else--hopefully, where I'm treated like everyone else."
1,"I have been Vegan for many years, and I appreciate any place that has an all vegan restaurant, especially in tourist areas that are usually lacking. The food was very good. As far as other posts about the service, you have to realize the food is made fresh and is not processed food that can be ready in minutes. If you need faster service you need to go to the fast food chains where all you get is pre-made and processed foods. I will definatley go back when in the Vegas area. Beats all the crap food on the strip!"
0,Food was tasty but portions were small and pricey. My wife did not care for the seared Ahi.\nBottom line=you can do better
1,i dont go here that often because there are other theatres that are closer but i actually like going here. Their theatres are nice and spacious and i love the convenience of having trop. smoothies right there so i could sneak it in the movies;)\n\nbuttt the people that work there really need to chill or something. They look like they hate the world while doing their jobs. SMILE! at least fake it lol.
1,"It's in n out. If you like it, you like it. if you don't, you don't. I like it. It gets crowded though. I go during nonlunch/dinner hours."
1,Such good food!!! Not cheap. I had the duck confit mushroom risotto and it was THE BEST. Also the bread dip they give every table is Sooo yummy.
1,Another example that you can get great food in Las Vegas. Brought my family to Argana with 6 and 11 year olds. We all loved it. We got there at opening. Service was great. Started with every appetizer to get a tasting. That would have probably been enough food for dinner. The flavors are amazing. We live in the SF Bay Area and have yet to find a Moroccan restaurant with food this good.
1,"Having read reviews, we decide to try this place.  The chicken wings,  beef on weck, macaroni cheese were all good.  Husband had even the genesee beer.  Have lived in Buffalo, they even had Salemn hotdog during the weekend.  \n\nStaff was friendly, yes we will be going back again ! Parking would be a pain."
1,Have loved the fountains since I saw them 8 years ago. Beyond amazing. I love the different shows during the different times. I seriously watch the fountains and have no interest in the casinos. It is always hard to walk away knowing that in a few more minutes another show starts. Well worth the wait if you get there right after one show ends.
0,"Nun warte ich schon \u00fcber eine Stunde einmal angerufen soll nur noch 10 Min. dauern bin gespannt. \nUm den Beitrag nun zu vervollst\u00e4ndigen: Die Pizza kam dann nicht nach 10 Minuten sondern nach 35 Minuten. Insgesamt waren dass dann mal locker 1:35 h.\nBei dem Anruf wurde mir versichert dass gerade sehr viel los ist und die Pizza unterwegs w\u00e4re. Mein pers\u00f6nlicher Eindruck ist folgender:\nIch hatte die Pizza \u00fcber das online Portal http://www.pizzeria.de/ bestellt. Dort hatte ich schon zweimal bestellt einmal an meinem Arbeitsort Gie\u00dfen, einmal bei einem Event in Karlsruhe und nun ganz privat zu Hause. Die Bestellung klappte auch ganz problemlos, so wie immer.\nBei meinem Anruf in der Pizzeria Pizza Sofort (hatte mir die ausgesucht weil sie am n\u00e4chsten dran war) war wohl meine Betsellung untergegangen, das konnte man aus der Konversation der Telefonistin und des Pizzab\u00e4ckers heraush\u00f6ren. In diesem Fall h\u00e4tte die Lieferung 35 Minuten nach Bestelleingang gedauert was an einem Samstag Abend durchaus akzeptabel ist.\nDer Anlieferer hatte eien Flasche Cola dabei, die aufs Haus ging aufgrund der Versp\u00e4tung. Das fand ich als Entschuldigung Klasse. Der Pizzafahrer erkl\u00e4rte: es w\u00e4re gerade so viel los.\nZum Objekt meiner Begierde: \nBestellt hatte ich eine Pizza Hawai, 40 cm, f\u00fcr 11.50 EUR. bekomme hatte ich genau dass was ich bestellt habe. Qualitativ bleibt festzuhalten. der Belag war \u00fcppig und meiner Erwartung entsprechend. Der Pizzaboden leider nicht so ganz. Er war nur 3/4 fertig. Man hatte sich also sehr beeilt meine Bestellung so schnell als m\u00f6glich fertig zu machen. Schade da h\u00e4tte ich gerne noch 5 Minuten l\u00e4nger gewartet. \nFazit: Wenn die Bestellung termingerecht in der Pizzeria aufgenommen worden w\u00e4re glaube ich h\u00e4tte das echt gepasst. Dann w\u00e4re die Pizza eben erst nach 40 Minuten eingetrudelt, der Boden w\u00e4re ganz fertig gewesen und mir h\u00e4tte es auch geschmeckt.\nAber h\u00e4tte, w\u00e4re und wenn ist eben nicht das Bewertungskriterium.\nSo bleiben mir nur zwei Punkte zu vergeben, denn es war eindeutig zu sp\u00e4t nicht so schmackhaft wie es h\u00e4tte sein k\u00f6nnen. Drei Punkte w\u00e4ren drin gewesen, wenn man mir gesagt h\u00e4tte, wir habens verschwitzt und der Boden w\u00e4re durch gewesen."
1,"I like this place, a lot.  So sue me.  Good, urban location, yet plenty of parking for us mis-placed suburbanites.  I don't think the prices are too out of line, given the upscale nature of the place.  We have fun trying to figure out which movie they're playing on the TVs, what is the best way to sit on the oddly-shaped stools at the bar (who would think straddling them is the best? so uncomfortable!!) and pretending to have never tasted the White Rabbit drink (sugar-tastic).  Usually a pretty good crowd here, always a good time.  \nDownsides: no real food, Pandora playlist then there's no dj (that works great for work, but kinda iffy at a bar), the line for the men's washroom.  seriously."
1,"I found the waitstaff a bit pushy, but the food was great.  Really a good deal for the amount and quality of food you get.  Love how you are able to choose from a selection of very unique tacos.  The three plate taco deal is the best.  I especially love the backyard BBQ taco.  I keep coming back to this place, although the margaritas could be a bit stronger!"
0,"The spa needs a serious upgrade.  It was not very relaxing with brighter lighting than I'm used to for a spa environment.  My massage was not at all what I expected.  I got the hot stone massage and I've had it many times before at other spas but this one was just not up to par.  It didn't even match the description in all of their brochures.  My masseuse made a ton of noise, too which made it really difficult to relax.  My friend also got a massage and said she was offered the choice of four different oil scents.  I was never asked anything about oils. \n\nMy manicurist actually did a pretty good job on my nails so that was nice...not nice enough to ever return or recommend this spa to anyone."
1,"We had a small wedding reception *12* on Sept. 10th 2010.  The staff was amazing.  Very attentive.  The show was awesome.  They even cut, plated, and served our wedding cake.  They went above and beyond to make sure we were treated special even though we were sitting with the rest of the bar patrons.  We loved it and can't say enough good things about this place.\n\nIf you are ever in Vegas, stop by TI and visit Kahunaville...ask for the Big Kahuna...but take a cab home.  JUST SAYIN."
0,"This single location has completely turned me away from Einstein Brothers.  On the several occasions I have been there, I have encountered mediocre food and an incompetent staff.  If you are a fan of this chain, avoid this location."
1,"I don't really like giving chains 5-stars but I think Buca deserves it for several reasons.  First off the servings are huge, which allows you to order a few things for the table and have your party pick a large variety of tastes.  \n\nSecond- the price point is not bad for the amount of food you get with entrees ranging in the $15-$30 range (depending on serving size).  if you sign up for their e-mail club or coupon clip you'll see a $10 off purchase of $20 or more.  Get a small pasta and two drinks and you've got yourself a very reasonable date!\n\nLastly the food is very good.  Maybe they don't have the bread sticks or salad like Olive Garden, but the dishes themselves are very good.  As you'll see with my other reviews of Italian places, I use Buca as my \""base-line\"" to compare other maybe fancier places."
0,Before  I rant... the Manager did take one of the plates off our bill...so that was a plus. \n\n\nWe looked up the best BBQ places in Vegas (Google) and this place was at the top. Looking over the reviews on Yelp we figured it was going to be good. \n\nI ordered the pork sandwich with potato salad. My wife ordered the brisket plate with mash potatoes and collard greens. \n\nMy meal... it's hard to describe... the pork at no flavor at all...it's topped with coleslaw and BBQ sauce. I added salt...magic dust...and two kinds of BBQ sauce to get some sort of flavor going. The potato salad tasted store bought. \n\nMy wife's plate.  Brisket.... brisket should be fork tender... no knife should ever be needed. It lacked flavor as well... and was tough/chewy.  She thought it had the consistency of boiled meat. The greens tasted like they were from a can... no flavor/seasoning. The mashed potatoes...straight from a box.  (her meal was taken off the bill as she didn't eat 95% of it.) \n\nWhen you walk in to the place... you see the grand champion signs from 12 years ago over the doors... maybe this was a killer BBQ place back then... but... I can't say the same for it now. I would not recommend this place off the experience we had. I'm sure there are many more BBQ joints in Vegas worth trying...\n\nWill not be going back.
1,"This is the first time that I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory and I am a fan! We started with the spinach and artichoke dip and it was pretty good. The bread that they brought out was I think dipped in a whole vat of butter, the complementary bread they brought out was actually better with the dip. For the main dish i got the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and it was awesome. The flavor and the crispy topping brought everything together. The veggies and the chicken were plentiful and covered in the sauce. I brought it home because i couldn't finish it all and it was just as good reheated. The wait staff was very polite and knowledgeable."
0,"I live in Brookline and have wanted to visit for months, finally I got the chance.  Let me start by saying that I am a discerning foodie.  I like good food and good service, but I also want to see new places move forward.\nPiatto is located on the Blvd next to a bar/pub in a heavy foot and car traffic area.  Parking is easy to find.  The dining room is very pleasant, linen table cloths and a nice renovation of an old house.  A nice place to have a meal.\nI arrived at 7:30 on a Friday night.  There were maybe 8 tables and 7 were full.  By the time I left at 9 p.m. the dining room was empty.  From 7:30 to 9 only one additional customer came in.\nService was friendly but ungodly long.  One server for the whole dining room.  She took the orders, served he food, cleared the tables, ran the bar and collected the money.  It took 75 minutes for two dinners and no dessert.\nThe meal:  \nI had linguine with shrimp and scallops.  It was prepared in a red sauce.  The pasta was soft, far from al dente. I really had to search for the shrimp, first because there were so few and second because they were frozen and petite.  The scallops, well Im not even going to go there.  The sauce was overwhelmed by oil!  Yes, oil!  In fact I sent it back to drain the oil off the plate, it looked like broth. See pic.  When it was returned, oil was still sitting on the plate but it was spiced up with sprinkled cayenne pepper now.  Ugh, what up?\nMy diner companion had chicken saltimbocca - layered prosciutto  saut\u00e9ed with marsala wine and mushroom sauce.  Sounds good, right?  My dinner mate noted that it was low on flavor and disappointing.  \nThe spice of the evening was cayenne.  It is put in salad, garnished on plates and added to sauce.  Ive never seen such all across the board use of cayenne anywhere.  The table guests next to us kept coughing and fanning themselves as they tried eating their dinner salad laced with cayenne pepper.  Defining difference?  I think its a deadly mistake.\n\nTwo meals, one glass of wine, plus tip, $58.00\n\nThe chef came out to greet the tables.  Affable young entrepreneur for sure.  I would suggest asking the guests how to improve the flavors of the food he is making would be a good next step.  He is cooking to his tastes and in my opinion he is missing what I come for.  He apologized multiple times for what was wrong from stock, to stove to plate.  That is not a confidence inspiring action.  I wish him luck, there is alot more to do here.\n\nI won't be returning."
1,"As with many others, my first experience of Rita's was back east.\n\nYou definitely cannot complain as far as the customer service here is considered. Behind 100% satisfaction! The older gentelman even came to our car to tell us thank you for visiting his location. \n\nOnto the goodness...\n\nI was in the mood for custard so I skipped the Ice but man oh man...it was so lickin' good!!! It was sweet, creamy, full bodied and simply delicious! \n\nI can't wait to go back and get a Gelati. I just hope I can find georgia peach the next time I am there."
1,Love the food here. So far everything I've tried has been good. Inside the restaurant could use some improvement. Whenever I eat from here I take it home because I don't like the inside but the food is great.
0,"Staff here are great. Thanks, guys. \n\nNow we come to the game-changer for me. Recent renovations have resulted in two things happening: \n\n1) A table is now thoroughly unstable. Staff knows but no one has replaced the faulty table. Hot coffee on this table will immediately spill. With Banner next door, this won't be pretty. \n\n2) I can no longer sit in the chairs here for more than an hour. They hurt!\n\nI'm going to move my [$70/month] coffee business down the road, to a pre-renovation location."
1,"We made a last minute reservation with Executive for our return to the airport from Treasure Island.  The $6 cost per person was a big savings over the $30 we paid for a taxi when we arrived and the least expensive of any of the shuttle services.  Our driver was extremely friendly, the coach was brand new and we were able to pay in cash when we boarded and didn't have to reserve with a credit card.  Plus, the driver used the back roads behind the casinos to avoid heavy traffic on the Strip.  We were totally impressed with the service and will use them again anytime we travel to Las Vegas."
1,"Kiku was so effing good I took one bite and then accidentally punched my friend in the shoulder w my excitement while saying, \""This is so effing good!\""\n\nWhy do I ALWAYS forget about Kiku?  \n\nYou must understand, I love sushi and it's not because I love drinking a whole bunch of sake before I eat the sushi, during, and after.  I go for the sashimi bc I'm not effing around w the rice.  If I'm dining w friends who say they like sushi but won't stray beyond a tuna roll, then I'll just eat regular nigiri w the rice but...bring me raw fish, on a wooden boat, and I'm a happy girl brandishing chopsticks.\n\nI am SO very tired of people talking about Umi.  Umi is spectacular and I love it, but there is other sushi to be had.  I've DONE Chaya and Sushi Too and Sushi Kim and Ginza (RIP) and Kotobuki and Ooshi Bento...  But I always forget about Kiku, and I think it's because its tucked away in station square.\n\nNewly rediscovered, I recommend you dine here.  Its beautiful inside.  They have one of the most sushi restaurant expansive menus in Pittsburgh.  Will sushi make your friend gag?  Bring them here anyway, there is so much to choose from, sushi or otherwise.\n\nThe pricing is reasonable.  The place does not smell like fish.  You'll leave full, and happy, and you wont feel like your wallet has just been raped.\n\nThere is a reason that Kiku has been around for so long, and that it has been nothing but consistent.  Good service, great food, & good atmosphere.  If you haven't been to Kiku in awhile, pay them a visit.\n\nNow I'm craving sushi and I just had some...."
0,I came here to check out a New Mexican spot I was seated quickly but it took a while for the server to take my order. I ordered the supreme nacho special and made it vegetarian by taking off the chorizo. I thought it came with refried beans but it came with black beans instead I asked my server kindly if she could put refried beans on top of my nachos she acted like she didn't understand and for what I presumed was the manager I apologized about misreading the menu asked him the same thing he had an un pleasant demeanor the server brought out the refried beans the server never checked back on me during my meal the nachos were good but the service was poor. And on top of all that they rang me up for the wrong price...
1,"Friend recommend this place to me over a year ago and I love it. It's a small bar in Henderson. Best pizza in town I think. Always packed but I've always have great service. The owner or manager comes out once on a while and ask how everything is. Bartenders are really nice, chit chatting with everyone."
1,"Everything we ate was awesome, especially the bacon-wrapped filet mignon. The only caution to you is remember that this place is awesome, but not cheap. We paid about 70$ per person last night once you factored in drinks, tax, and tips, but it was worth it."
1,"an AMAZING show!\n\ngreat music (speakers on every seat and in front of you)! great for everyone, whether youre a beatles fan or not (but c'mon how could you not be?!) There is so much to see. Visuals up, down, below, everywhere along with a great cast and great music, you cannot go wrong. You will be surprised and in awe..guaranteed! Such a feel good performance. \n\nOh yes, and not a bad seat in the house. And yes, I was all the way at the top!\n\nCreative genius. A must see in vegas!"
0,If I'm paying you for event I damn well better have an options on music. The music sucks balls the owner is a total asshole times ten and the food wasn't all that great. Oh this was my First Lady and only visit I wish I never visited. Awesomeness
0,"We were excited when we found that we could add George and Sons to our delivery list.  The food is good, not great, but it was a great option on lazy nights.  Tonight when the food was delivered it seemed like the price was a bit high.  There wasn't an itemized receipt attached to the credit card slip so I said to the delivery guy this seems high.  He gave no explanation so I tipped as usual.  Well turns out that there is a $4 delivery charge so this guy made a pretty big tip for driving down the street. I have no problem with delivery charges because there are some crappy tippers out there; I just hate having extra charges slipped onto my bill with no explanation. This will probably be the last time we order."
1,Our Pink Jeep tour of the Hoover Dam was just amazing.  Our tour guide Randy was exceptional and very knowledgeable in pointing out all of the interesting and historical spots along the way.  Randy even took a slight detour to show our group an area of big horn sheep coming down a mountain and into a residential park area which was fantastic.  Our group took a short boat ride on the river below the Hoover Dam that provided us with a different perspective and knowledge of the Dam that not everyone is able to experience.  The tour of the Hoover Dam was great and provided us with the History and construction of the Dam that was unbelievable.  We would highly recommend the Hoover Dam tour with the Pink Jeep Tours to anyone and if you are fortunate to have Randy as a guide it is just icing on the cake.
1,"Hawaiians rejoice!  Another great place to get some ONO local food!  Those in the know are aware that the food at Ross J's Aloha Grill is very similar to the food at Aloha Specialties in the California Hotel because they are both owned by the same family (the last time I checked).  So the food you see at Ross J's for the most part you will see at Aloha Specialties.  This is good for the folks that live in Henderson that don't want to drive all the way to Downtown for some mighty good Hawaii-Style grub!  Save gas...save cash!\n\nI love me some Calrose rice and macaroni salad when my diet allows me!  I hit this place up whenever I get to this side of town.  All their dishes are local favorites so I never have a hard time going wrong.  Popular of course are the Kalua Pig, Chicken Katsu, Chop Steak, Beef Tomato, Garlic Chicken w/ Brown Gravy (super ONO), Loco Moco (Hawaii STAPLE, duh), Teriyaki Butterfish, Meat Jun, and the Teriyaki Chicken.  Each of these plate lunches and more come with two big scoops of rice and a big scoop of macaroni salad.  Even better, all of their favorite dishes and Teriyaki plates are in the $7-$9 range!  So cheap for so much food!  They also do Menehune (mini) plates, and combination plates to satisfy everyones appetites and wallet.  Beefy on a budget!  Sweetness.\n\nRoss J's also has gread noodles: Saimin, Won Ton Min, and Fried Noodles.  Always selling are their Bowls as well, my fav is the Teriyaki Chicken bowl.  I almost always get this with servng of mixed vegetables, and a Teri Burger and macaroni salad on the side!  Funny enough, this is my same order at Aloha Specialties as well.  Their Teriyaki sauce is addicting!  They also do burgers, and Spam Musubi too.  \n\nFor breakfast, they got you covered!  Eggs with Portuguese Sausage or Spam, and rice?  Pork Fried Rice with Eggs?  Loco Moco for breakfast?  Sign me up, son!  Hawaiian Hearty at it's best!  \n\nFood is excellent, service is quick and friendly, and prices are good.  Visit Ross J's Aloha Grill and taste the Aloha Spirit!!  In the food, in the food...please do not taste the staff!"
1,Only place I could eat every single day! I always get the same thing...Greek salad with chicken kabobs. The  pita that comes with the salad is hot and delicious. I also love  their French fries!! Everything I have ever ordered here is fresh and very tasty! The owners and servers are very kind. I like dining in and getting togos. Oh and  when I get wine it's always a nice big glass. A+ all around!
1,"Jaime was great.  She was patient with us, being first time customers.  Love the beer selection.  Ordered mac and cheese and fish and chips on her recommendation.  The mac and cheese was awesome. The fish and chips needed some salt and was good.  Also had a Reuben sandwich, which was great.  Some might not agree because all the fat wasn't trimmed off.  Got there early so it wasn't busy. As it got closer to 7pm and trivia time, it got busier and we had to wait for our server to bring us the check. Will be coming back."
0,"This was a first meal in Montreal.  We were underwhelmed.  We started with the lobster bisque.  The wife is a big fan of lobster bisque.  We've have a lot of lobster bisque in a lot of places.  The wife was not happy with the reddish saltwater we were served.  Not much better after that.  I had the mussels and frites which were good.  The girl had pizza (not so good) and the boy had chicken fingers. He didn't like them, because strangely, they tasted \""weird\"".  After trying them I told them that was because they were freshly breaded and fried and not frozen.  In other words, I told them that's how chicken is supposed to taste.  He thought I was crazy.  At that moment I couldn't help but wonder if maybe I really was a bit off my rocker if I thought we could bring teenagers to a place without a McDonalds.  Where's that Tim Hortons?"
0,Don't DO IT! They ARE HORRIBLE!! Stay Away!! LOOKS are deceiving...
1,"I've never been to Latin or South America so I'm definitely no aficionado on the food; however, regardless of authenticity, the combinations of ingredients created a flavor profile that was entirely new to me.\n\nWe arrived early and spent the better part of an hour at the cantina bar, chatting with a very friendly bartender who created a delicious lemon ginger margarita. We went during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week, which means we missed out of some of the \""fan favorites\"" that bring return customers back to Alma. But the foods we tried were all expertly prepared with fresh ingredients. I had:\n\nPlatanos maduros\nRipe plantains, fried and tossed in sugar with a spicy black bean sauce\n\nEnsalada de quinoa\nQuinoa salad wrapped in thinly-sliced cucumber, with pickled vegetables\n\nPollo Adobo\nBraised chicken in an ancho chili sauce, served with black beans, rice and tostones\n\nBiscochito de chocolate\nWarm chocolate cake with a sweet center, served with cinnamon ice cream\n\nWe plant to return to Alma to sample some of their regular menu items."
1,"What a great place. We went late on a Saturday night and got seated right away. The waiter was attentive and quick, our water glasses were always full and we always had fresh bread and sides.\n\nThe buffet portion of the meal was lovely, with lots of fresh salad ingredients, cheeses, and interesting items like asparagus and fresh mozzarella. The cheesey rolls they bring to your table are like crack for your tastebuds--you just can't stop eating them. \n\nThen of course, the main event: The Meat. Waiters come to your table offering whatever they have on their skewers and everything we tried was fabulous from filet mignon to New York strip to lamb and pork ribs. Every bite was heavenly and we ate until we couldn't move.\n\nThere's nothing truly unique or fancy, but if you like quality meat, in massive quantities, for one set price, with lots of side dishes, this place is for you!"
1,Only been here once but the Italian Hero on a garlic bagel was very good...  they price was perfect for the quality and quantity.  I will go back.
1,"These guys are the best.  They know the products inside and out, and are kind, informative, and fair in everyway.  Take the guess work out of your repair, and let them do what they do best.  I have had many Mercedes, and do know them well, but these guys have so much experience, and knowledge, and I could not recommend a more trustworthy source then the great people at MB Motors.\nYou guys Rock!!!"
0,Make sure you have a reservation and are dressed nice otherwise you will be seated in the bar area to be ignored by the wait staff. Oh and you only get menus if you ask for one instead of being provided with one when seated. It takes 20 minutes from getting seated to getting some water. Wait staff has serious attitude problem. When I ordered an ice tea out waiter let out a sigh and rolled his eyes.
1,"A very nice Casino as your entering Nevada from Arizona, they have a great selection of slot games and table games We didnt go to any of their restaurant options here, but the staff was very friendly and helpful.\nIts a nice place to stretch out your legs if your coming from Phoenix, and has some great scenery here!"
0,the restaurant is NOT open for 24/7!!!!!!! Who wrote that?!!!!!!!!! And I took a taxi just for a closed restaurant
0,"And the owner left me a message insulting me and insinuating that I don't undertand smog laws after I reported the shady way I was dealt with!\n\nThis is what she wrote, \""In the future, please know the laws of the city you live in before leaving a derogatory comment suggesting my employees break the law for you.\""\n\nThey failed my car, saying the vacuum lines were improperly routed, and they are bone stock. It passed the smog sniffer with flying colors. Passed for the last two consecutive years no problems without changing a thing.\n\nWhat arrogance, instead of fixing the problem, attacking the customer for pointing out the problem."
0,"This applies to ALL Starbucks worldwide. Starbucks customers and future customers (their children) are some of the most pretentious individuals on this wonderful planet. Only in dire straights will I buy coffee (just coffee, not a  fancy \""grande mocca with a shot of vanilla soy based non fat carmelyate bullshit\"".

0,"Drop off for my hotel (Flamingo) was two blocks away. I scheduled a pick up from my hotel to the airport at 11:15. There was a shuttle there at 11:15 but they were only dropping off not picking up (and there were no other passengers on the shuttle). When I called at 11:25, I was told the driver was running behind (duh!) and that he would be there in 5 minutes. He did arrive at 11:30. Overall, I just wasn't impressed with the service."
0,"It was our first time here today and we've heard that it's one of the best -- \n\nservice was below average - our server is not friendly at all and is not very attentive. we had AYCE and ordered 6 long rolls and some nigirl.\n\nordered hot tea and took our server 10 minutes each time she had to refill our tea. she passed back and forth and once checked if we wanted to order more and if there's anything else we wanted.\n\nsushi was room temperature and is not the freshest. \nat almost $30/head for dinner sushi -- we were expecting more both from the service given to us to the quality of food being served.\n\nunfortunately, this will be the first and last visit we'll have at this joint,"
1,"Had a wonderful dinner at this resturant two nights ago. The service was very good, and our most attractive server very helpful with suggestion. We sat outside with lots of other people, a very cozy neighborhood atmosphere. I  had the best soft drink of my life, \""iced mint lemonade\"" unbelively good, lots of crushed ice, and vibrant, fragrant mint cut up very fine and of course the lemonade. Served in a attractive tall jar.\n\nWe had a rio of mezes, babaganoush, fresh cheese, olive oil, and spices and a new one on me Sunna squash with a dash of maple syrup and hot paprika, very good. And of course nanan. We,then had oven roasted leg of,lamb covered with spics and a thick tomato sauce, grilled vegetables and basmati rice executed perfectly. \nWorth a try if you like middle eastern food."
1,"Last year, I stayed here for a conference ... and I loved it!!\n\nThe location is amazing and the amenities at the hotel are fantastic.  I really love the lazy river and I was amazed that they could give special attention to every guest at the hotel when we had nearly 400 people at our conference.\n\nThe fire pits at night are a great place to hang out while enjoying a cocktail or two.  I can't wait to go back!"
0,"I usually get descriptive in my reviews, but this one is easy - OVERRATED.  The decor is trendy - with different rooms and different music including the pussycat dolls lounge, but don't be confused by the wait in the lines - it may take along time to  get in but they don't turn anyone away.  It was packed with greasy folks and I found it incredibly hard to enjoy myself while I was being pushed in every direction.  There are so many things to see and do in Vegas - definitely pass right on by here."
0,The only thing nice about this place were the gold fish.  I have never been to any Chinese restaurant that charges for handful of rice.
0,I called in to get a fill and pedicure i arribes about 10 minutes late to my appointment. Once i arrived i showed them what design i wanted which was fairly simple. The receptionist told me that the tech (Nina) wouldnt be able to do that design but the tech insisted she was able to give me the design i wanted. I got my pedicure first and i asked her to cut my nails shorter and she didnt do much except file the nails a bit shorter she made the excuse that i she couldn't make them shorter when clearly i know my own nails and they can be shorter than what she had left them at.\nAfter came the full and the color/design. She did a good job on the fill but when it came to the design wasnt able to do the design i wanted. I felt lied to by the tech when the receptionist clearly asked her if she was able to do the design. I ended up with nothing i wanted and felt like the tech just wanted my money and business. I dont know if i will be going back to the salon but i felt very deceived by this tech she shouldn't have lied and said she was able to do the design when the receptionist said she wasn't able to do the design. Dont visit the tech Nina (asian lady).
1,This is not your typical Vegas hotel.  It is located on the strip and has 2000 rooms but gives you the feel of a boutique hotel.  The service is very good (although I think it is strange that no one wears name tags).\n\nI would have given the hotel 5 stars but I was not a fan of the amount of children in the hotel.  They need to discourage kids from staying there and encourage couples and singles to come and get away from kids.\n\nAll and all we had a blast!
1,"Super-fast, super-friendly, and knowledgeable, they sized my new watch perfectly in just minutes and at a very reasonable rate."
0,"Overpriced for what you get.  Roll was fair, a little spongy.  Meat was pretty tasteless and an odd texture.\n\nThis place would never survive in my native Philadelphia."
1,"Went here on Saturday the 6/28/14 . There were no big DJs or special guests but Dayum! This place is crackin! red bill vodkas, pools, people having a great time. Everyone was in a good mood. Seriously could not have had more fun in one day. Will be returning for sure. A must visit place if you visit Las Vegas. If your a large group of dudes, get a VIP host to walk you in. Well worth $$$ spent."
0,"We were excited to try this place out.  I doubt we'll go back now though. The zingers were awesome.  Service needs a lot of work. Appetizers came 40 minutes after we arrived.  It wasn't that packed either. As soon as we could (shortly after the appetizers arrived) we asked the waitress to not wait on bringing out the food. She said she had just placed our main dish order 5 minutes ago so it could take a while.  This is about 30 minutes after we placed our order. We were a little pressed on time to go to a play. They brought out one wrong order, never apologized, and charged us for it.  They didn't even give us plates to put the pizza on. Overall, disappointed.  Not even a single apology for the delays, wrong order, missing plates and utensils, or anything.  What should have taken at most and hour took 1 1/2 hours with wrong orders and poor service."
1,"Came in to have a very early morning breakfast (or late night snack, if you will).  The host seated me quickly and provided a menu.  Table service was decent though certainly not as prompt as I would have expected.  No overall complaints on the service provided, though.  I just find when I'm by myself having breakfast that I prefer bar service (not available here) so that I can get in and out a little faster than standard table service (a little slow).\n\nI'd originally hoped for the prime rib they had advertised but they had already run out for the day (which is completely understandable - it was about 4am in the morning after a busy Saturday night).  So instead I ordered the steak and egg breakfast combo.  The steak's flavor was really delicious - cooked perfectly (medium rare on my order) and seasoned very well.  The downside to it was that nearly half of the cut was extremely sinewy and nearly unable to be chewed.  The eggs were ordered sunny side up and delivered perfectly.  The order came with a side of toast and their breakfast potatoes which were both done just right.  Beverage service was pretty good about refilling my glass when it was empty.  Pricewise, the meal was very reasonable and I think that had I taken the time to get a member's card at the casino, I could have even saved more money on the purchase.\n\nSo the overall rating I provided is lower due to lack of service efficiency and the tough, chewy quality of part of the steak.  To be fair, I did not request a different cut of meat - I didn't want to wait for it, so I didn't give them a chance to correct the error, hence I didn't give too low of a review score, either.  I'd recommend going here and based on some of the other Yelp photos I've seen, I will likely be back to try stuff out.  Maybe the prime rib next time..."
0,"I have must of been here on an \""off\"" night. I was not impressed. The place is decorated like a Claim Jumper.  The service was good, however I was told the specials and the aged 28 day steak sounded good. When it came out there was so much pepper rub on the steak, I couldnt taste the meat. The pepper rub was so overpowering  that I couldnt eat but two bites. I let the server know my feelings about the steak and he said no problem we can just box it up for you. What?!?.  So anyway he proceeded to take it away and box it up. The real surprise is when I got the bill $78 dollars just for the steak!!! Last time I take the special without finding out the price. It was not worth the $78 dollars. Anyway, I pay the bill and chock it up to a lessoned learned"
1,"You have no idea how badly I wish there was an Earl of Sandwich location closer to where I live.\n\nThese sandwiches are wildly delicious. And, it is an awesome choice to save half of the sandwich for later on in the evening, when you're returning home, drunk and starving, from the clubs. Plus, I believe this location is open all the time. But, of course it is -- it's in Nevada.\n\nThe only thing that made me sad about Earl of Sandwich was that I waited in the huge, long line through Planet Hollywood, dreaming of the Italian sandwich I was about to eat (made with salami, capicola, roasted ham, mortadella, mozzarella, tomato and Italian dressing), only to discover that they were out of these ingredients and couldn't make me one. At the last minute, I went with the plain and simple ham 'n swiss ($6.99).\n\nI wasn't sad for long, though, because the service was very efficient, and the sandwich was amazing. The ham was warm, the cheese was melty, and the bread was crisp and hearty. The ham 'n swiss is simple but so, so effective.\n\nI fantasize often about just driving the 32 miles to Downtown Disney in Anaheim solely to reunite with Earl of Sandwich."
1,"We had an awesome dinner here! \n\nThey seated us right in the window on the strip. Great view!! Fabulous service!\nThe food is really good, classic italian. The best in the city? No, but a great place to go, especially if you have friends visiting and staying on the strip and want to meet up with them. They make it really easy, valet right in front of the elevator!\n\nMake a reservation, it gets really busy!\nAnd ask your waitperson for food guidance. They know which way to direct you through the big menu!"
1,"Want to go to a bar with a younger more upsacle crowd? This is your place.  If prohibition was high school, then you would move on to Dandelion Market  to hit up college parties.  The people here are generally better looking and more mature. \n\nThe Food\n\nThe food here is awesome.  The calamari is some of the best I had in Charlotte.  One night though, it wasn't done so well.    The mac and cheese is my favorite although some people may find it a little too rich.  I think its perfect.  The lamb lollipops are bomb ass.   Soul has them beat on their lollipops, but they are a close second.  Dandelion's whole menu seems tapasy which is fine and its not overpriced at all.  I think you get a decent amount for what you pay. \n\nBar\nIf you arrive before 10pm during the weekend there is a giant table upstairs that lifts up into the celing to create a dance floor.  The DJ plays a good mix of hip hop, old school, and top 40.  There is great energy in this place. The drinks aren't too bad and their is always a special such as $5 bacardi anything etc.  If its too much upstairs you can always go downstairs for a more relaxing mood. \n."
0,I was excited to try Nom Nom Burger as I've read some great things but I'm sad to report that I was very disappointed.  The restaurant was pretty empty - there were maybe 3 or 4 tables the entire night (we were all outside) - but the service was slooooow.  The server was a nice enough guy but definitely did not have a sense of urgency about anything (or even a sense of 'that table may need a drink refill').  It took about 15 minutes for us to get our bill and pay which was surprising considering there was virtually no one in the restaurant.\n\nThe food was our biggest disappointment.   I ordered the Nom Nom Burger but felt there was nothing nomtastic about it.  It was...boring.  I felt like there was no flavor or anything interesting going on inside the bun.  I was hoping for a little kick or spice but found it rather plain.\n\nMaybe it was just an off night or maybe my expectations were too high but Nom Nom just didn't do it for me.
0,"This place looks like a strange drs office. It's oddly decorated and it's huge yet there are only 2 chairs. It doesn't make any sense. \n\nThe staff is unfriendly. Nobody greets, you you just sign in and sit down. When it's your turn they call you up and there is no interaction at all. You can tell these women don't like their job and they don't care about customer service. \n\nI wasn't even asked how I want my eyebrows she just went to town and I'm so mad because they're sooooo thin and uneven!!! Biggest mistake of my life. They looked fine before I only needed a touch up. She went so fast she ripped so much out and she didn't seem to care about being precise. Now my right eyebrow is further right than it should be and who knows how long it'll take me to grow them back out again. \n\nI tried this place because it's right by my house and I didn't want to drive to summerlin but wow being lazy did not pay off. Biggest mistake coming here!!! Don't do it!!!!!! Go to Diva Beauty."
1,"I'm always skeptical of buffets, the Yelp reviews helped my decision to give it a try. Loved it. And they keep bringing hot garlic naan to the table. \n\nWish they would label the foods with a few English words. Though almost everything I tried that was unknown to me was delicious. \n\nNot wild about Indian desserts, though the rice pudding was a hit."
0,"Nous avons fait une r\u00e9servation de groupe et puis, disons que nous en sommes sortis tr\u00e8s d\u00e9\u00e7us du service.

You're killing me LVH with your restaurants, Benihanas was the only awesome restaurant. We are going elsewhere right now for dinner."
1,"We decided to throw my son's 1st communion reception at this Komex location and it was the best experience. You wouldn't think to throw a big group party here, but Linda and the staff made hosting my party of 40 people a breeze. Linda made the reservation and ordering process so simple. She answered EVERY question I had and made sure I was well taken care of throughout the whole party. The staff was so helpful and the food was fresh and ready to serve when I requested. They split my appetizers of bulgogi fries into proportionate servings so that I could spread it out amongst my guests and they set up a buffet-style area to serve the main dishes. They even allowed my to drop off my cake to hang on to until serving time and provided a knife and plates for that as well. I was worried about the expenses of drinks since they only sell by the can or bottle but they provided pitchers (actually fancy serving bottles) of filtered water to offset that cost tremendously and I just ordered non-water beverages for whoever wanted it. They set up the tables in rows so my party can all sit together, and they also covered the tables with tableclothes for a more elegant appeal. I also appreciated the complimentary salsa and chips to feed my guests until everyone arrived. Thank you all so much for such an amazing experience and I can't wait to go back!"
0,"My family and I stopped in for dinner and overall, I am glad we did because it is always good to avoid a chain restaurant experience.  Some positives here:\n\n1.  Home cooked food.  \n2.  Portion sizes were fair.\n3.  Menu was good American style dishes.\n\nSome down sides that I hope they will work on to survive and thrive as a business in the area:\n\n1.  Service (we've only been here once so maybe what we had was not representative of their typical)\n2.  Food temp (some of our dishes were inconsistent)\n3.  Service.  (yes, it is important enough to mention again.)\n\nHere is hoping to marked improvements at Liberty Station.  It is always nice to see a non-chain alternative in Surprise!!"
0,"Pluses: \n-Good central location, as opposed to some airports that are quite far away from the city they serve. \n-Easy to get out of if you are being picked up at the curb (although driving through the airport is a slow process)\n-Rental car facility is fairly new and quite spacious, but...\n\nMinuses: \n-Rental car parking facility is far far away. The shuttle bus to go from the rental facility to the terminal is 12-15 minutes, so plan accordingly for your outgoing flight.\n-Baggage check and Security lines can be quite long, especially at the SW terminal (C) in the morning. Here's a tip -- if the Gate C security line is very long, try the Gate D entrance. You will have to walk over to C but the reduced wait should make it worth it."
0,"I really wanted to like this place.  Since I moved to Phoenix I have been looking for a nearby local bike shop.  Bike Barn is right around the corner from my office.  It seems like the tendency is for anybody that deals in specialized goods is to become really cliquish.  As you can see from looking at the reviews under \""bicycle shop\"" it is definitely something that goes on a lot with bicycles.  When I  first started looking for a shop I took some time off and went to 5 in a row.  I would go into the shop and look at their stuff.  No one said anything to me in the first 4 shops.  That seems to be typical of bike shops in Phoenix.  If you aren't in the club they don't have time for you.  I suppose it doesn't help that I am not young, pretty and particularly fit, but when I was all three I raced bikes, worked in a bike shop, and lived the life for years so apparently I have unrealistic ideas about what service can/should be.\n\nUnfortunately Bike Barn is a typical Phoenix shop.  I have gone twice.  The first time I talked to a semi-informed unfriendly mechanic .  The second time I sought help in getting the right fit on my bike (with an appointment paying for the time, mind) and it was clear that the person had better things to do.  Don't know what, the store was empty.\n\nSo...if you are part of the club, or the staff is having a good day...good for you.  I won't be back."
1,"Davinci's is one of the best pizza spots in Charlotte.  Not sure why they have no reviews but the pizza is NY style and very good!  They have sandwiches and pasta also, but the pizza is the star."
1,"Being so close to the other Grand Lux in the Venetian, I was surprised they built this one too.  But I'm really ok with it.  One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  The choices are extensive and the quality of the food is quite good.  I haven't had a bad meal yet.  The combination plates are fabulous and way to much to eat, as with most of their meals.  Make room for the Red Velvet Cake, the best desert ever."
0,"The service was great. We had kids and everyone was super friendly and extremely attentive. (We were the only ones there on a Friday night at 5 though.) \nFood is where it goes downhill. We got the crab cakes which were only mediocre. The ones I make are better and they don't cost $24. My husband got the surf and turf and it was not good. Again, I make better shrimp and better steak and it's not $26. I think Applebee's makes better steak and shrimp to be quite honest. The veggie bean burger that my kids got was decent, and the spinach artichoke dip was ok. Would definitely not go back here and would not recommend anyone else waste their money."
0,"The only reason my husband and I had dinner here is we had been up and down the Strip, gambling and drinking since 10 AM, and the line for the Avenue Cafe was too long. We didn't wait very long, and our food was at least hot and flavorful when it came out. Husband had a pot roast, I had some type of pasta that was a bit too spicy. The tomato-basil bisque was good. Prices were ridiculous for what you got. VERY loud and yes the waterfall will get you a little wet. I'm thinking if I'd had three less margaritas we could have stood in line at the other cafe. In short, probably really great for kids, but then who brings kids to Sin City? Apparently plenty of people, as we saw the week we were there. Whatever."
1,Great deal (it's free!) and quite the collection. Loved spending my lazy afternoons here as a student and young professional.
1,"I could be that I'm the oldest person to ever go to CYC Fitness in Madison based on the reviews...and possibly the only male.  Look at my other posts, I'm a serious fitness enthusiast.  I love indoor cycling in all it's forms.   I was in Madison for a meeting and followed the advice of a friend to attend a CYC class.  The studio sign in area, lobby, and locker area is large and comfortable.  The studio was loud, but I've been to louder.  The work out was tough, no doubt.  I was soaked after 45 minutes, which for me, is the measure of a great workout.  The instructor introduced himself, sought me out as new to the studio, assured I was set up correctly, and checked on me at the end of class.  I was super pleased with the experience.  I frequent some of the best studios in Chicago.  The amenities at CYC are second to none and I was pleased with the post work out shower facilities.  \n\nDownside, the bikes are just a little close.  I felt that it would have been better to have had a few more fans in the room.  It was hot, and not just because I was getting my butt kicked.  It is definitely focused on co-eds.  Of course that's a major focus of the studio since if is located on University Ave in the middle of Madison.  But, there is a larger market in that area and they should try to expand their reach.\n\nI really enjoyed the experience and I'll definitely go back!"
0,"Pfft. If I wanted to pay for overpriced burgers and fries, I'd go gourmet. Instead, I'll drive down the street to In-n-Out for something worthwhile.\n\nOnly drunk college students head here late at night."
1,"I always enjoy having coffee when it's not from the green lady people and Rush does an excellent double espresso. Just as good? The lemon cheese pastry with a side of sweetened cream cheese. Delicious!\n\nI sat here at Rush for about an hour and used a good amount of their wifi while drinking my coffee and eating that pastry. Mostly decent music played and there were several interesting conversations going on that kept me entertained.\n\nCold morning, so the outside seats weren't occupied and there were still a couple of two-tops available inside. I liked this place!"
1,"This is my go-to Pho place for several reasons.   It is super close to my house in comparison to all the other pho places in vegas.  It is never over crowded, and the service is good.  I usually order to go and it is always ready when I get there.  I get the number seven, just the simple pho with the raw meat that cooks when I throw it in the broth. The serving size is GREAT, I feel as though I almost get more when I order to go? But I'm not sure. They don't skimp on the meat, I think it is the perfect amount and there are always lots of the veggies and such in my to go box, I love it.  I do always ask for a side of sriracha, I can't eat pho without it.  Great flavor over all! And a huge serving, I'm always extremely full after and thats saying something for me.  I have sat down to eat several times and enjoyed it.  They do charge by the can for sodas which is a little annoying, but makes sense since it is a small non-chain restaurant. I can understand that. The lady at the front is very quiet service wise but I get the feeling it is just because of language differences etc, to be blunt (not because she is unfriendly or anything).  Great pho place near summerlin, definitely worth a visit!"
0,"If this were a few months after it opened, I would have given five stars.  Now this place is a shadow.  Service is poor, prices are super high, and they have no clue how to cook meat.  Last two times everything comes out rare, regardless of what you order.  I always order medium well, last two times the meat is pretty much purple/red inside.  Sent it back both times and they returned with charred bits.  The second time I asked to speak with a manager, after expressing my displeasure with the porterhouse and he said that my party had eaten enough (roughly 2 pieces between 3 people ~10-15%) to be charged and they would do nothing about it on the bill.  In my 30 years of eating out, I have never felt compelled to not leave a tip.  I not only left no tip, but the remainder of the destroyed porterhouse.  Don't mind overpaying for a quality meal/experience, but Carnevino is not worth the hassle.  Give me a break Mario."
0,"Came here on a Friday afternoon around 2... no dim sum carts..its okay..we ordered from the menu and also ordered a chow fun entree.. there were only 3 tables eating(including ours) at that time.. Food was just okay and service was horrible!!! How can you not provide service to only 3 tables in the restaurant..Don't you want to make money?  \n\nThe food took a very long time, considering we ordered the most common dim sum dishes such as the shu mai, dumplings and some other plates..After our first round of dim sum orders, we asked about our chow fun.. She had no clue..because she didn't put the order in! She didn't even check up on us and our food took such a long time.  Guess this place is only good on weekends with carts or something but I will definitely NOT coming back here, there are other places around Chinatown where I would gladly eat at."
0,"the woman who i think is the manager is a major b**ch.  i don't have a student id anymore b/c i've already graduated.  i went back for a sorority reunion and they wanted to charge all of the alums without a student id $15 cover.  i asked why they would do that when WE'RE the ones old enough to buy alcohol.  finally they relented,  but the woman at the door snarked, \""You could at least thank me for letting you in.\""  oh my god, thank you for letting me in to your establishment to spend money here.  \n\ndrinks were WEAK and service a bit slow.  bartenders were friendly at least.  they have large booths, so it's good for groups.  expect to see a lot of dry humping, which is unfortunate since this is comparatively a really well lit bar."
0,"Hands down, the worst cleaning ever!  They sent two of the laziest women who seemed annoyed that they were bring paid to clean a house. I was paying for a deep clean as the home had been vacant and they basically vacuumed and that's it but somehow it took them 3 hours to finish the job. I pull up to the home and they are sitting in their car yet I'm still being charged for their time.  I tell them I want to check the finished results and I couldn't believe what they called a deep clean!  I wish I could post the pics of urine still on the toilet, black paper towels from their failure to actually clean in the drawers(which was specifically asked for), stuff on the carpet as they don't vacuum all the way to the wall, dirty light switches, and they ruined a portion of the new tile upstairs.  Spoke with their manager and she did they would stay on her dime as long as we needed unfortunately they stood there watching me on my hands and knees cleaning the cabinets, etcetera. Was told by manager she would call and not charge me but upon checking my credit card she immediately charged the full amount.  Their owner Mark called a week later and refused to believe his people did not do quality work, if only he would read all these reviews.  He was one of the brashest human beings I have ever spoken to and very combative.  He told me to dispute the credit card charge if I was unhappy with their work. Molly Maids does not stand behind their work and if you want to pay money to have to reclean your home once they leave this is what you get.  RUN from this company!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"The ambiance in this tiny place is so adorable, on that lil patio that is kinda in between what looks like a main dining room and a hookah lounge.  I came to eat with a friend who'd been craving Mediterranean food. I was so shocked that this spot was still open, after 10PM. They have a full bar and a nice lil hookah bar.  The food is bomb and the service comes with a smile.  I can't remember our server's name but he was so nice.  He described how the dishes were prepared and let me know that it was possible to make lil changes if necessary.  Their lentil soup was so good. I think it might have been the best that I have ever had.  This one had what seemed like a cotija cheese on top.  That made it so delish.  I know that lentil soup isn't all that exciting but let me tell you, esp coming from someone who doesn't like lentils all too much, this lentil soup is fab!!! I'd come here just for that and the warm pita!! The schwarma plate is huge. Sorry I'm sure I didn't spell that correctly. Anyways, the portions are large and really could feed 2 people.  The prices are right and they are not shy about refills on drinks and things. Awesome. I can't wait to bring some friends here, when they are in the mood for something other than a buffet or pho on spring mountain. haha. Oh and before I forget to mention, they even have an all you can eat pasta option for about $10. Good deals."
1,"Super great atmosphere, has the NFL package, great drink prices... If only it wasn't absolutely filled with cigarette smoke inside."
1,"Every time I've been here the food has always been delicious and the service has always been very exceptional. My go to is the Laredo burger and the Mac n'cheese as a side. They Mac n' cheese is absolutely wonderful if you like garlic! I've had a few other menu options as well that have been superb. The beers on tap are always great. My newest favorite is the First! Pumpkin Ale. \n\nOne thing I really appreciate about Rock Bottom is that they aren't one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when you're done eating. The food comes out fast (which is great when you're starving!) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions there's never any rush. I was just at Rock Bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didn't start until 11pm. We got at the restaurant around 7:30, ordered drinks, ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to Walk over to the cinemas. It was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped ordering.\n\nMy only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. Medium often turns into medium well, but that's not a huge problem for me. I also don't think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that's more of a corporate complaint since Rock Bottom is a small chain. \n\nOverall I definitely recommend eating here if you're in the Waterfront!"
1,"It has been a a while since I have been to a restaurant that has great service and amazing food at the same time. I been to tons of fancy restaurants in California and all over America. \n\nThe evenings specials were all unique to the original menu. I went with the 20 ounce rib eye and the gf went with the Chilean Sea Bass. The steak was cooked to perfection and the side of rustic potatoes were crispy thru the end. \n\nI tried her sea bass, and I can honestly say that it was the best fish dish I've had in my life. The fish had salty roasted peppers on the side and it perfectly complimented the delicate fish. It was literally melting in my mouth. My steak was perfect, but I could not stop eating her Chilean Sea bass. \n\nThe service was one of the best I have ever experienced. I am not just saying this because the food so good it blinded me. The service was really top notch.\n\nOur waiter, the older bald gentleman, sorry I can't remember his name. Was really attentive and genuine with his speech. He wasn't over bearing or overly friendly to the point where it annoying. Straight to the point and very prompt with everything. \n\nI been to  masteros and it is one of the most pretentious places on the planet. I am pretty sure masteros gave my gf a usda choice cut of steak and charged us for prime because they thought we are young and wouldn't notice the difference. I have a feeling a lot of high end restaurants do this. They have cheaper cuts on the side for suckers that they think won't notice the difference.  \n\n\nAnyway, forget all other restaurants, I will recommend all my friends to Ferraaro's. Don't be fooled by the plaza. Go in and try the sea bass"
0,"Cute disney steam punk theme with shitty bartenders n shitty drinks n TGIF food. Female bartender was cool but dudes were all hipster steampunk douchebags thinking I'm so serious I have to read the cocktail recipe moving my lips. Hostesses are hot. Classic bait n switch.  You ever seen those animatronic pirates on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Disneyland?  That's what these bartenders reminded me, automated and slow.  In fact, I think you could program those robot pirates to mix faster and better cocktails, then they would scoot along their tracks to the next customer.  I mean even the dude bringing me my food talked to me about the food and seemed to take more pride in the food than these guys did in their \""cocktails.\"""
1,"This place is ridiculously amazing. I went in and couldn't decide what I wanted. it all looked way too delectable, so I had them pick out some items for me. Was not disappointed. I'm hooked. Very friendly staff, and you can tell they love what they do. Left with a smile, and was even happier when I got home and stuffed my face. Thank you, arai pastry!"
1,"Nulook really knows what they are doing! I had searched all over vegas and got quotes from many different vendors, but i felt that Apollo was overall the best.  He was very reasonable with his pricing and his team always met deadlines.  My home now looks beautiful with the natural maple floors and brand new cabinets.  Apollo was a definite pleasure to work with and I recommend him to anyone looking to remodel their home."
0,I would give a zero star if given the chance. These guys are scums.  Try to sell me intake clean and other useless crap.  They also tried to add 30 for labor on a basic oil change. \n\nAVOID at all cost
1,"Good spot. The store is pretty vast for a Princes Street spot, and offers a comprehensive selection of camping and hiking goods. One of our friends was getting ready to embark on a week - long solo hike and needed camp stove equipment, which he found.\n\nPrices were quite reasonable, with lots at 2-for-1 and other specials.\n\nService was very friendly. I bought a passport holder for a lousy \u00a33, and upon finding a small flaw, the clerk went out of her way to make sure I got a perfect one instead."
1,"I love the ambiance and decor here. The booths are spacious and comfortable. The service here is magnificent. Everyone is very attentive, friendly and helpful. I'm not sure if this happens often, but we kept getting free small samples. Our server brought what I think was a small pao de queijo and two pieces of chocolate throughout the dinner, which was really nice/neat of them. We had the golden apple salad, which was refreshing and light. We also ordered the tuna tartare which did not seem very fresh and I would not recommend. While they offer other entrees, their steak selection is glorious. They have wet aged 21 days, dry aged 35 days, cows from all over the country and even from Australia. Personally, I think wagyu beef can taste too gamey so i don't really prefer it as much (I know I am weird). I really love a good bone-in rib eye so that is exactly what I ordered. Because it was wet aged and bone in and prime, it was super greasy and juicy. The meat itself was cooked to perfection. Slightly charred on top and very juicy medium rare prime meat on the inside. I didn't order a side, but I think this is where you should get potatoes to soak up all the juice or you save your bread to eat along with the steak because the meat itself and the juiciness can actually be too much after a while. I ended my meal with the chocolate souffle which was very rich. I really enjoyed my meal here, but I wouldn't name it one of my top favorites only because I didn't really care for much else on the menu. Steak alone great, everything else ehh."

0,Even though we had a reservation we were made to wait for a car. If they're going to overbook cars they should offer free upgrades to get people on the road. I'd look elsewhere.
0,Staff is a joke and don't know what they are doing. Only good thing about this range is the gun selection..other than that i can say this place is ran by a bunch of clowns!!!  Please choose a different spot save yourself some cash and frustration. Will not be coming back...ever
1,"I'm in the process of preparing my place for a new puppy and went into this store with a ton of questions. Not only was the staff very knowledgable on the products they carried, but also helped me work within my budget.\n\nThe staff was not only knowledgable, but very personable and courteous. I wasn't treated like a noob or ridiculed for saying the wrong thing. \n\nThe prices seemed reasonable, especially for the quality of product. I feel much more prepared and will definitely be returning to this location again!"
1,"A vacation kitty favorite! 5 stars! *Casino review only: If you like craps, this is the place. $3 limit offering 100x odds. Dealers are awesome. Very friendly and entertaining. Some are absolutely hilarious. The bar is awesome. $1 Michelob bottles and frozen margaritas. Bartenders are attentive. Other drinks are of course offered at a reasonable price. Cocktail service is good. Comped beers are draft in cups. Be sure to hit this place in the early am for it's entertainment value. The drunks are passing by on their way home and the hookers do a shift change at the bar ~5:30am. This place is awesome!"

0,"The worst dining experience I can remember. Brought friends from Washington, DC.\nWe were only people waiting to be seated - 2:00pm. No one to seat us. People waiting at front desk to pay.

No wait staff present.\n\nAfter 15 minutes I went to a waiter filling up salt & pepper shakers. He said he was going off duty. I asked him to find someone. Another 15 minutes and he comes back to take order. Had to talk 'slow' so he could take order.\n\nOrdered \""Siegel Mountain Burger\"" $13.95 (menu said Kobe beef).

Lettuce was white core pieces! A cheap bun, a load of french fries -- for $13.95. A Carl's Jr $6 burger is better.

0,"Der Besuch des Aposto war leider einer der wenig erfreulichen Abende meiner Karlsruher Restaurantbesuche.\n\nDas Restaurant ist riesengro\u00df und durch die Spielarena f\u00fcr Familien gut geeignet, das bedingt allerdings, dass man als Paar meiner Meinung nach hier nicht viel Ruhe bekommt.\n\nProblematisch sehe ich vor allem zwei Dinge: Das Essen und den Service.\n\nZum Essen:\n- Die Gerichte f\u00fcr mich und meine Begleitung kamen mit einer Versatz von 8 Minuten\n- Die Spaghetti aglio olio kamen mit Kirschtomaten. Was haben bitte Kirschtomaten darin verloren?\n- Positiv waren die Bruschetta, die geschmacklich sehr gut waren\n\nService:\n- Es dauerte ewig bis mal einer an den Tisch kam und bei Reklamationen war man in unserem Fall wenig bem\u00fcht, obwohl das Personal damit Erfahrung haben sollte\n- Besteck musste ich selbst holen\n- Gleiches beim Salz und Pfeffer\n\nFazit: Hier stimmt das Preis-/Leistungsverh\u00e4tnis vor allem auf Grund des Service meiner Ansicht nach nicht. Teilweise kam mir der Service \u00fcberfordert vor (meine Meinung). Und wenn auch nur ein Italiener in der K\u00fcche ist, w\u00fcrde ich gerne wissen in welcher Provinz in Italien Spaghetti aglio olio mit Tomaten serviert werden??\n\nKeine Empfehlung von meiner Seite.

1,"Holy crap! Was completely surprised by this little joint. The $8 for $14 worth of food yelp coupon is redeemable by smart phone, so you can buy it on the spot. \n\nGot the veggie burrito bowl - I don't say this often,  but this would have been just as good without the cheese. There was so much going on that it wouldn't have been missed. Meal was a touch salty, but otherwise delicious. My husband highly recommended the carne asada.\n\nService was a bit slow for lunch, and the music selections are a bit off-putting.  Otherwise, five stars."
1,"It's Monday and I am still stuffed...maybe that will resolve itself through the course of the day today...we'll see.\n\nI had clients in town yesterday (and they are friends, as well...always nice to do business with friends:) and they wanted to see the new casino at the 101 and Indian Bend and have brunch...all in all, excellent ideas!\n\nThe casino and resort (which has been under construction since I moved to town) have really turned out nicely (at least the portion that is finished...some of the landscaping, pools, finish work inside...well, about 80% of the resort is done...so they have that going for them:) is really very lovely...2 or 3 giant steps ahead of what I expect from a local casino (we aren't in Vegas, after all!).\n\nThe important pieces are done...and by important, I mean the pieces that make them money!...the rest of that stuff is just for show.\n\nThe casino itself is very nice for a local casino...the restaurants are open and going...they actually serve Peet's coffee here (if you are a Bay Area transplant, you'll know what that means:) and the staff is super accommodating!\n\nWe showed up for brunch on Sunday at 11:30 and there was no wait to get a lovely table near the window so we could look down on the construction of what will become a desert nature walk area (probably kind of \""Disney\"" version of desert and native American life...lots a dirt and concrete right now...should be nice when they get it done:)\n\nThe dealio seems to be essentially unlimited champagne, bloody mary's, blini's, and mimosa's with brunch...for $25 a head...and given the quality of the food...and the quantity of the food and drink...that's a terrific deal:)\n\nWe sat there (well, sat and ate, went and refilled, repeated as directed) for 2 and  1/2 hours...the place wasn't busy and it seemed we had our own wait staff making sure that our drinks were never dry and that dirty plates never piled up...in short, assuring us of a wonderful time:)\n\nI have sampled a few breakfast buffet brunches around town over the past few years, from the Phoenician to the Fairmont to Eagles Nest to the Wrigley (The Beautiful Carin loves no meal quite so much as a Sunday Champagne Buffet Brunch), and I can tell you that this place measures up in every way...and exceeds many of those much more expensive brunches!\n\n* The food is presented so appealingly...on porcelain instead of in steam trays!\n* Chef's at the ready for any special request (if you don't care for the pizza that is available, they'll make whatever you want...no extra charge:)\n* Gelato, as well as pastry for your sweet tooth:)\n* Fresh shucked oysters on the  1/2 shell...on ice...with all the accouterments!\n* A grill next to the carving station (you want your prime rib with grill marks on it?...no problem:)\n* You want sushi fresh cut, or a fresh stir-fry for your meal...they whip it up while you wait...wonderful!\n\nThe buffet is laid out much like the Wynn in Vegas...tucked behind the massive bar and easily accessible, but not in line of sight, so you can enjoy your meal('s)... without all the clanking, cooking, and other things that often accompany a buffet.\n\nNone of that would matter if the food and drinks were crap...but they aren't crap...in fact, the food and cocktails were terrific!\n\nI talked to several of the chefs and told them how really good I thought this place is and they just beamed with pride...they are having a good time and making some good chow and it shows in every bite:)\n\nAnd for me, the bites kept adding up...I didn't find anything that wasn't tasty (and I ate pretty much everything:)\n\nThe good news is that I was wearing my \""eatin pants\"" so I was ok right up to the time we dropped my clients off at their hotel...then it was all I could do to drive home and drag myself to the couch...moaning...in pleasure (no, food pleasure...I couldn't have done anything else:)\n\nEven Carin needed a nap Sunday afternoon (in spite of eating a much \""healthier\"" brunch than I did, with her special request stir-fry and what have you)...those champagnes glasses do add up:)\n\nIt looks like Sunday has become \""Brunch Day\"" once again, now that a good one is so close...and so reasonably priced!\n\nNow I just need to figure out a new workout program that will allow me to deal with the extra 12,000 calories every Sunday:)"
1,"Being from the bay area, I have Indian/Pakistani restaurants by the dozens everywhere. So, when we looked up for Indian food in the Vegas area, I wasn't having high expectations. I was surprised by what I had there. It was freaking amazing! And the cherry on the cake, it was zabihah halal. We had the following:\n\nChicken fried rice: absolutely awesome. The rice had a slight crunchy texture and though by concept may sound like raw, but was actually superb.\n\nYellow dal: the best dal I have had in the US. Period. Low in spices and full of flavor. In love with dal now.\n\nMalai kofta: didn't care much for the kofta, but the gravy was awesome.\n\nChicken kadhai: wasn't bad but we had far superior food on our table.\n\nChicken momos: the momos were amazing but the sauce with it wasn't. I have had a lot of momos in India (my fav roadfood snack after chaat). I used to love the chilli sauce served with the momos in India. Here the momos were pretty close to the original though.\n\nPaneer pakoda: good. Liked the sprinkling of chaat powder over it. \n\nChilli chicken: was nice. Not like India, but am not complaining.\n\nThe portion sizes could be upped a notch. The half portions are way too small and the full aren't that large themselves.\n\nThe decor is nice. Not date night but better than Indian restaurant standards. The service was really good."

1,"We were able to get a Living Social deal to come out to the Wildlife World Zoo, which included a ticket for admission and two tickets to feed the stingrays.  It was a bit of a drive for us, but that's what weekends are for, yes? \n\nWe were expecting this place to take some time, but we spent far more time here then we thought we would - which was great! They have tons of animals to see and the indoor / outdoor locations were spread out nicely to give us a break from the sun when needed.  \n\nNote: wear full shoes and not sandals...our feet were horrible when we got home!  Nothing is paved, it's all sand and rock (lesson learned). That's our fault for going to a wildlife place in the desert with flip-flops!\n\nDillon's is attached is you want a quick bite to eat - reviewed that already separately.  Be sure to get your hand stamped if you eat there and plan on getting back into the zoo.\n\nWe were there for about 4 hours for just the two of us, so if you have little ones you might want to plan on it taking a bit longer.\n\nOverall: A\nNot a bad way to spend a day of our weekend - grab up a Living Social / Groupon deal if you find one and head on out!"
1,"Decided we would stop in at happy hour for J's birthday and have a bite to eat after seeing they had a write up in AZcentral. With new management and an updated look, figured we would check it out. ( To be honest, we saw they were offering a free appy, with a purchase of a drink... up to 2 per person:)  Great stuff!  They have a burger on the appetizer menu! Went with friends and tasted a little of everything,...mini-fish tacos, shrimp cocktail, Blue Cheese burger, lobster lettuce cups, calamari...Everything we ordered was enjoyed by ALL!  The only tiny issue was that the poor waitress was working the bar area by herself and was a little overwhelmed.  Help arrived just in time for the big crowd.  Didn't get a chance to try anything off the dinner menu.  We were pleasantly stuffed off our free appys! :)  Get in there before Dec.31!"
1,Finally... Great sushi in the NW.  Its great to have this place with a wonderful variety now available.
0,"What's the big deal with this place?  After reading all these rave reviews I thought I was missing out on the meat mecca of the east valley.  I decided to check out the restaurant for a quick lunch on a Friday afternoon.  The parking lot was packed, which is always a good sign.  After first making my way into what turned out to be the bakery I made a wrong turn into the meat market.  I finally found my way into the restaurant and was seated at a tiny 2 top in between a bunch of old folks.    Not that I have anything wrong with old people, but I was there for lunch and I think they were there for an early supper!!!  I had the turkey sanwhich, which was good but nothing better than I could have made myself.  I think next time I'll just head across the street to Sprouts and get a much bigger and better sandwhich for the same price without the blue hairs."
1,"Attractive, fun, and super helpful staff! Tried so many places and flavors...never was content until I discovered Puff Vapors!!! Highly recommend them.  Thanks guys!!!"
0,Sushi was ok.... Very fishy taste for some reason.....Serivce however was great.... The drinks served were horrible.... Probably would not recommend..... Next ...
1,Avocado pizza was decent. The shop next store is very cute and a nice way to pass time while you wait for a table. Or if you go for breakfast its a nice way to pass a few mins. \nI was disappointed the last time I was in as my order was completely lost and I patiently waited for about 30 mins and had to go up and reorder. But they did comp my meal so I'll let it slide this time :) But the breakfast I had was simple and healthy. Exactly what I was looking for that day.
0,"I don't know why everyone gives the store in Tempe a good review. I just went today to make a simple purchase of a table and chair for my grandson and it was a nightmare. I have never liked the layout of IKEA, finding it confusing and illogical. Sure enough I was trying to find the children's section. No signs, and no sign of anyone work working on the floor. I wander around and finally find it, pick out what I want and get a shopping cart. That's where I hit my first major snag. The cart doesn't wheel right. It goes all over the place. I decide to ditch it and get one in self service figuring they have to have them there also. Of course they don't because that would be logical. I happen upon one that was left there and guess what? That one also doesn't wheel right. Like the other one it wheels all over the place. I can barely control it. I press on tho to get my items and can't find one of them but there are workers there so I ask one about the missing item. He has to call someone in that dept. Really? You can't just help me find the right bin? While I'm waiting I find the item myself and struggle to get the cart to one of only two cashiers working. To get the sale price of my items, I find out I have to belong to the IKEA family. At this point I don't want to belong to this moronic family but I want my discount. I'm told I have to join at the kiosk. Its pointed out to me by a worker running from me. Nice. I can't get the kiosk to work. No help around now. Another customer asks the cashier who gives us forms to fill  out to get the card. Apparently after you go to the kiosk you have to fill out this paperwork for the card anyway. Huh? And why didn't the cashier tell me that in the first place? I'm now beginning to suspect the workers are sadists who like to see us suffer.\nI purchase my items but now I have to figure out how to get my uncontrollable cart out of the store and to my car. I find that heaving the cart away from me gets it to move the most feet. I crash it into a wine rack. I don't care there are no workers around anyway. I heave it some more and manage to get it out the door to my car. It took me an hour and a half to purchase a simple table and chair. I don't plan on visiting my new 'family' ever again."
0,"There is only one factor by which to judge a car wash - did they get the car clean?\n\nSure, other factors do play a small role: such as how much it costs, how quickly it gets done, how close it is to where you are and how friendly the staff is. To be fair, the cost is a personal issue: for some $35 to wash your car is a ridiculous waste, while others may consider it a fair price. \n\nOf course, no matter whether you decide a fair price for a car wash is $35 or $3.50, you know what to expect. And if you decide to spend $35 - well, you expect it to be clean.\n\nSo no matter what you think is a fair price for a car wash, I can assure you that Washworks is not the place you want to go.\n\nP.S. the scam about the window chip repair that other reviewers mentioned is real. I saw one attractive young girl looking rather distraught as they called her over to explain it to her insurance company."
1,"Some more favorites to share:\n\nWhile THEIR crab cakes may not do it for me, I've invented my own using supplies from Trader Joe's: in the refrigerator section they sell a 1 lb. can of all claw crab meat for about $8! I mix this with 1/2 c. panko break crumbs, 1 egg, 2 tablespoons Trader Joe's Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce and a couple shakes of louisiana hot sauce. It makes about 5 fairly large crab cakes which I pan fry in olive oil for about 4 minutes per side. Now, THAT's a crab cake! \n\nAnother favorite concoction, thanks to Trader Joe's is their light champagne vinaigrette, black mission figs, crumbled goat cheese tossed with sliced red onion, arugula and a cut up apple -- it's an AWESOME salad!\n\nDessert? Trader Joe's dark chocolate bar caramel with black sea salt -- F'n A!! There are NO words!"
1,"Stopped by here for a late breakfast on a Friday. Place wasn't too crowded but before we go any further kids- this place is cash only! \n \nWe had \""the morning after\"" breakfast special which includes 2 eggs any style, pancakes and choice of bacon or sausage. We both got bacon and over easy eggs. The eggs were eggs, the bacon was kind of on the small side with only 3 salty strips (NJ people know that a diner breakfast plate has a tangled up mess of bacon, you can't even count the strips if you wanted to!) but the pancakes were great! Two cakes that were thin with crisp edges with a not too sweet buttery flavor. Perfect canvas for eggs, bacon, and syrup or sweeter add-ons like chocolate chips.\n\nCoffee was decent, bright retro decorated atmosphere, no complaints on service."
0,Went during lunch time and serve was extremely slow.
1,"I had the Char-Broiled Italian Sausage which was really good. Fries were just fine. The chili is really tasty. The combo is super good. Open and airy atmosphere, very enjoyable. We will return for sure."
0,"Went here a while back for dinner.  Without exception that staff was rude and condescending.  From the hostess to the waitress and water boy, all acted like they were doing us a favor, I don't think one of them ever smiled.  \nWe had the free range chicken which came on the plate swimming is some thin broth.  Looked and tasted exactly like boiled chicken, bleck!  Also ordered ravioli, got three ravioli in a thin watery light red sauce, bland, tasteless.  Will NEVER be back."
0,"People have to stop judging Indian restaurants by how they make Chicken Tikka Masala or any Tikka Masala for that matter. Yes, Chicken Tikka Masala is an Indian dish but it is not the only Indian dish. Hell, it's a north Indian dish that seldom gets any attention in other parts of India.\n\nI choose Curry Corner over other Indian restaurants in this area because of its positive reviews. I ordered a Lamb Biryani and a Chicken Curry to-go was told the order would take 15-20mins. So I sat at one of the tables and patiently waited. The place was not busy and almost everyone who came after me got their food served while I was still kept waiting. Finally, after more than 35mins of waiting my order was ready and I was told the Lamb Biryani usually takes time to prepare. So I thought maybe Biryani was worth the wait.\n\nInitially the Biryani looked good but when I started digging into it was when I realized how badly it was prepared. The Biryani was just rice mixed with some curry and a few hard-to-chew lamb pieces thrown in. Trust me, it tasted awful. I simply don't understand why some Indian restaurants have this compulsion to include a Biryani on the menu when they don't know or even have the faintest idea about how it is prepared.\n\nAnd as for the Chicken Curry, it tasted OK; nothing great - just mediocre. \nCurry Corner is another Indian restaurant serving mediocre Indian food to susceptible locals. What a shame!"
1,"I love this little place! I have been going here for 5 years now and I have never been disappointed. I typically go for their lunch specials, ordering the Pad Thai with beef....delicious! The soup they bring out is very good and varies on the day. My favorite is the egg drop but they are all yummy. The staff is friendly, they don't talk much but are attentive. If you are in the mood for something sweet I recommend the Thai tea.....soooooo gooood!"
0,"The only reason I went here was for a book club meeting.  I've been here several times and the food is very sub-par.  Didn't much like the steak, and the fries were terrible.  How hard is it to master french fries?  The service was slow.  It was over an hour before we got our entrees, and they weren't that busy.  And then, the server interrupted our conversation and gave us some long winded sales pitch that totally pissed me off.   I think they were selling some discount card or something, I was too annoyed to listen."
1,"I've been going here for 3 years now and it is one of my favorite places to eat in the Phoenix Metro. Now that they have expanded the restaurant I don't really have anything negative to say about the place at all. Their food is fantastic, the atmosphere is laid back and the prices are very reasonable. I've tried several of the Pasties and while they are all fantastic my favorite is the Lamb vindaloo. If you haven't been here yet it is a must try!"
1,"I love Mickey's. I love that it's a converted old house, with the back rooms still looking as such with bright paint and comfy couches. There's a pool table in back, and the bar area also serves as concert space. In the warmer months their huge patio is perfect for a nice night chatting with friends. \n\nThe drinks run strong (last night we couldn't taste the difference between the whiskey ginger and whiskey Sprites we ordered) and the beer is cold. Sometimes the bartenders can be a little gruff (though never rude or mean), but that's half the fun. \n\nBonus points for supposedly being haunted by a guy who got knifed. No old building is complete without a good ghost story."
1,"The food I've had there has been relatively good.  The Wed/Fri night fish fry was great.  They have quite a few interesting drinks, so I don't have to stick to the vodka & soda routine that usually have to.  I like the place a lot, though, as far as service & environment.  It's really casual, and any Wisconsin sporting event (Packers, Brewers, Badgers, Bucks) will be on their TVs.  My boyfriend LOVES the food, maybe I've just had a couple mediocre rarities.  He gets the Old Fashioned Burger, which has a cooked egg on the top - I think it sounds gross but he swears up & down that it's GREAT, and he's an expert :)\n\nAll of the servers & bartenders I've interacted with have been polite, accomodating, helpful, and went out of their way to accomodate and be nice to us.\n\nThe mac & cheese is also excellent ;)"
1,First time going and the truffle burger was delicious. It was also happy hour so got to taste some of the other appetizers like the sliders and the spinach dip. Quite delicious! Will definitely come back and bring friends.
1,"We were in town for my cousins bachlorette party and this was her choice to dine.\n\nDefintely a place of fine dining.  From what I've been told, Michael Minna is well known for his lobster pot pie.  The was my first choice in order, but when we found out how much the cost of it was, i had to go with my second choice.... the cioppino.  It was amazing....they gave me a pretty decent size in some of the seafood, so I was pretty happy with what I got.   However, 2 guests out of our party did order the lobster pot pie and I was able to get a tasting, it was simply AMAZING.\n\nThe service we had was defintely a A+.  I found another great restaurant to dine and at and will defintely be back."
1,"If you don't live in the area (Henderson) or nearby you'd never know this place is there. It's hidden in a strip mall, which, I know is such a shock for Vegas (not!), next to the social security office. My husband and I discovered it one day after they first opened and went back several times. \n\nThe fish is very fresh and the rolls are very very tasty. If you sit at the counter the chef will prepare a special dish for you; we had something called Screaming Orgasm, and well, it speaks for itself. If you live in the area or have a local who can point the way for you, definitely give it a try."
1,A perfect stop on the strip to stop in for a drink. You don't need to go in through the hotel to get in. It is an open air venue so you get a lot of fresh air.\n\nWe ordered two Margaritas and the bartenders talked us into a pitcher (twist our arms). The 'ritas were quite tasty.\n\nThe bartender takes great photos as well!
0,"Extremely overpriced for what you get. Not nearly as good as it's hyped up to be. Ate here once and I will not return. There are much better alternatives IMO. Only myself and one other family eating yet the tables were all dirty. No combo deals, you add what you want to your burger and end up paying for each item!"
1,This place was delicious! Great service wonderful food! I had a burger and it was great. Had Apple crisp cobbler and omg I loved it! Highly recommend!
1,"I'm not big on philly cheesesteaks but we decided to go one day after we were done clubbing. One of my friends recommended POP'S since it was kinda close to us and its open 24 hrs. I  I ordered mine with provolone, green peppers, onions, and jalapenos...and a side of fries and ranch.  It was really good! I crave them all the time."
1,"I love pizza by the slice. Greasy, cheesy, foldable deliciousness. Fuel has it, and it's simple- served on a paper plate, and hot out of the oven. Salads are good too, though pre-made, but always fresh. Counter service is friendly, and quick. Cannot be beat when on the run."
1,"Great food, great prices and clean.  We stayed at the MGM and walked there every morning for breakfast.  Great 4.99 breakfast special!"
1,"Cex is good and we all know it.\n\nJust want to add on these reviews, that I went in here today looking for a replacement screen for my netbook and even though they didn't have it in stock, they sent me along to another shop which did have it.\n\nStand up guys!"
0,"I ordered a green drink.  Good thing I was paying attention to what they were doing. I noticed that there was no kale used ( but definitely  listed as a key ingredient).  When I asked about it the owner said ,oh yea we don't have kale, we are using all spinach instead- guess I should have told you that. Needless to say, I left - and won't be back.  No need to patronize dishonest practice. At $10 a drink, I actually like to get what I pay for."
1,"When I got pregnant, I didn't even search for any doctors, I just automatically picked Dr. Gex. He delivered my nephew 5 months prior, and my sister told me how much she loved the staff.\n\nI'm glad I trusted my sister's word. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. Dr. Gex is quite possibly my favorite doctor in the world. He always has a smile and a few jokes. He and his staff make you feel at home with them.\n\nWhen progress on my labor stalled and we had to do a c-section, Dr. Gex asked me many times how I was doing, and if I was okay. It's that kind of compassion that makes him a great doctor... Not to mention my scar is straight and tiny!\n\nWe love Gex Women's Care!"
0,"Considering the bar above it (Le Monde) is so amazing, Shanghai is definitely an anti-climax. In fact, the only reason I'm not giving it 1 star is the fact that, being on George Street it doesn't have sticky floors/carpets/that permanent vomit-mixed-with-bleach smell that so many 1 star clubs have.\n\nIt is true, the venue looks nice, but 'nice' is about is excitable as you can get when talking about this place. On literally every street corner along George Street, on any given night of the week, you'll be accosted by one of their street team trying to sales-pitch you into going, and they always try to convince you it's in some way unique and different from all the other clubs along this street.\n\nLet's see... it's in a basement below a bar. Tick. It's small. Tick. Unless you have done your homework on the drinks deals for that night then it's expensive. Tick. All the waitresses are stunning. Tick. It's pretty much the same as any other club nearby, like Opal Lounge or Lulu, but the difference is that in 4 years of going to Shanghai I've never had one of those great nights that everyone is still talking about weeks later. In the other two I have.\n\nIf I had to describe it in one word it would just be \""blah\""."
1,"Best dentists around. Everyone there, from the receptionist, to the dental hygienists, to the dentists, treat you like family.\n\nThe office has all the newest technology and therefore a quick turnaround on things like crowns.\n\nYou feel very comfortable (which is not always easy in a dentists office) from the moment you walk in. You can watch tv (any channel you like) while getting your procedures done.\n\nI recommended them to several friends and everyone agreed once going there that they would never go to another dentist. I now live in CA and drive back for any dental work.\n\nYou leave feeling confident in the work you had done, and truly feel like an individual they care about rather than just another patient. Highly recommend this office to anyone."
1,"fun!!!!\nthe food is good, lots of choices too. service is great! fun music and dancing. \nthe one thing that bugged us was a 3% charge for paying with credit card. they dont advise you of this til the end. kind of an  outdated practice,  and lets you leave with a bit of a sour taste after a fun experience. you would think that an establishment such as this can afford the 3% fee from the banks."
0,"Well, we were sooo exited to go to an authentic Puertorican restaurant. We are from Puerto Rico so you can imagine how happy we were to find this place. I would not have  given even one star to this place. But cannot post if I don't. My husband and I entered the restaurant, my son, his wife and two babies came in after us. There were quite a few customers.  We just stood there, no one greeted us, there was no sign that said seat yourself, there was a chef that could see us from where he was, did not acknowledge us. \nThen out came a young man, with a tee shirt and a soiled rag on his shoulder. Pointed us to a table. A couple came in after us and were served drinks and given menus. We asked the young man if we could have menus, and he said he would look for some! He came back, took the other couple's order and we still were without menus. We got up and proceeded to leave. Not a sound from anyone, the server did not ask why we were leaving, or if there was anything wrong. No customer service at all. What a disappointment !!! Definitely, sadly, we will not return. Puertoricans  are famous for being friendly and welcoming. None of that here!!"
1,"Java is the 944 for the hipsters and wannabe hipsters of Central Phoenix.\n\nDig it?  Maybe, maybe not.  Depends on the issue, the coverage and how many times I have to see the same DJs, artists, advertisers and the same lanky disheveled stoic Downtowners profiled.\n\nOther times I have found a perfect new gallery to fall in love with or read about the newest wine bar opening up the street.  \n\nLove it or not it this free monthly rag does a better job of covering Central Phoenix, Tempe and other hipster pockets than -- oh wait, zero, zilch, zippo.  \n\nYes, no one else is covering it."
1,This is the best sub place in the valley. Thinly sliced fresh meat and always fresh bread. Not the cheapest but way worth the price!
1,"Perfect place for small children!!! Your leather lunged kid could scream and scream and scream, and would simply blend in with non-stop din of the other small kids and blaring televisions. Just like the  departure lounge going to Orlando at an airport!! The food is made for children, frozen boneless chicken fingers and fries, just like at home. Kids can and do wipe their hands on all surfaces available, so you don't even have to think about cleaning up after them. Everything is really, really sticky! Many families have found this place to be excellent, they fill the place. Bon Appetit!!"
0,"My sister took everyone here for my birthday brunch a few days ago.  It was an interesting experience; allow me to elaborate.\n \nThe overall price was a real ball-pincher, I felt guilty knowing how much the bill was.\n\nI liked a hand-select few items and the \""main course\"" wasn't all the staff had made them sound.\n  By the time we were through picking small bits of protein from the bar, which I didn't mind (ahi tuna sashimi and ahi poke).  \n\nI wasn't impressed with the sliced meat section, as I thought the pork could have been allot more tender.  The Chinese steamed pork buns were mediocre at best; sadly, I've had better at some local chinese buffets.  \n\nMy Eggs Benedict (main course) was consumed after the buffet had been raided, so I was bordering on diabetic shutdown at that point.  I only had one large bite; it was no better than any other eggs benedict you could find at Bagel Cafe or Sunrise Cafe. \n\nWe all ordered \""free flowing\"" mimosas with blood orange juice as a result of the previous holiday buffet (Halloween); I've experienced better.  I personally would have gone for a tall glass of blood orange juice instead of the mimosas, the champagne was more towards the bitter/dry side, which wasn't my preference. \n\n I was sadly let down by those small peeves; however, I still had a great time experiencing a food-coma with my family and wouldn't change a thing, but I wouldn't recommend this place to any family or friends."
1,"Staying at the saguaro and honestly didn't expect to find such a nice restaurant there. Prices are fair and the portions are large. Tried both the pescado and the carnitas and both were really good but one must try the guacamole with crab, absolutely great! I've also tried the breakfast and it didn't disappoint nice omelette with some toasts with a really tasty pumpkin butter, as a swede this reminded me of christmas which was perfect :)"
0,Worst frozen yogurt place I have been to yet. Usually no problem with places but this place was worth the bad review. The customer service was very rude to my group of people. Pricey and the people at yogurt places are usually a little more happy but she was rude and didn't care about her attitude towards anyone.
0,"Boring and ordinary decor for such a pricey place!  We are foodies, we travel around the world, yet we love to prepare our own food.  Prices beginning at $75 per person without wine for the Pre Fix menu and mandatory that EVERYONE at the table must order it in order for one person to have it, began our frustration with this place.\n    It took our waiter an extremely long time in between each request  of, 'a fork, water, bread, wine, each course, etc.' and our dining experience continued for 3 hours - without dessert, and it was a birthday celebration.  Entirely too long and not enough attention for the mandatory gratuity at the end.\n    The prices were absolutely OUT OF LINE with the food delivered.\nOur waiter was arrogant, seeming to know and deliver more information about why they 'don't offer whole wheat pasta as an alternative', etc. etc.\n    Every other food item listed on the menu was unknown by all 6 of us college-educated adutls.  This alone made it difficult to know what we would be eating and paying for.  We questioned the waiter about it all, but it makes for an uneasy feeling, not knowing if the one ingredient in our salad, or entree would change the taste to the point of not enjoying it.\n    In an attempt to find something I could order without meat or a cream sauce, I ordered the pasta with a request to have the cream sauce substituted with Olive Oil.  I was delivered an entirely different meal.  The waiter and or the chef decided that i should get the vegan dish instead.  I have never had this experience and it was quite unusual, so say the least.  The waiter didn't apologize, but said the chef thought i would be happier with the other dish.\n    We were compensated by not having to pay for this vegan dish, without having to ask, but I was not happy with this service, when I was the paying customer.\n    The $15 antipasta plate had 2 small triangle of cheese, 2 very thin slices of salami and a bread stick.  Really!  Everything was alacarte if you didn't do the Pri Fix.  We finally asked for bread after we had been in our chairs for 30 minutes, starving for a morsel of food that didn't have a price on it.  Customary, ESPECIALLY at any 5 start restaurant!\n    Too far to drive, too expensive, and NOT reflective of all the reviews and hype.  \n    The worst part is that we were stuck having to pay an 18% gratuity regardless of the quality of our service.  This is America, where the wait staff earns tip money above 15%.  They have some work to do on their menu, their staff!, and their values."
0,"Whatever happened to the great service at this location?!?!?!\n\nI remember before it was rebuilt, they had a stellar drive-thru service. So good that Dave Thomas (rest his soul) came to visit. \n\nEver since the new one was built, you've got long lines inside and out. The cashiers don't really know what they're doing half the time. That's when a manager should step in. 2 registers and usually only one will be open. Another ridiculous thing is that they don't have \""self serve\"" drink fountains (I don't think at any location). There's barely enough room to stand at the register to wait for a refill. The food is sloppy. A lot of times the order is wrong. It seems like the drive-thru has priority. Oh yeah, I remember when they came out with the \""new fries\"" that they were guaranteed hot. That rarely happens.\n\nI actually like the \""new\"" burgers at the Wendys' locations but this place is the pits!\n\nDAVE THOMAS IS SPINNING IN HIS GRAVE, FRANCHISE OWNERS!\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
0,"The waitress with the warts around her eyes is terrible!  \n\nWhen I asked her about their juices and if they were blended together, she looked at me and said that would be gross.  Instead I ordered a sparling water, so she brought me a huge bottle that was big enough for four people and charged me $8.50.  That is a little much for one person to have water, if you ask me.  Then she didn't check on me again until I was almost done eating my breakfast.\n\nThe omelt and potatoes didn't have much flavor either.  I wasn't impressed."
0,"There's feces all over the bathroom. Used toilet paper all over the floor. When I say there is crap all over the place, there is no euphemism or exaggeration in the least bit.\nNothing was done when reported, no urgency to clean the fecal matter all over the place."
1,"All time favorite. My husband and I go here frequently. Great place to catch up with friends or just simply have some beers and people watch. You must try their Hippie sandwich and the oysters.. .WOW! Great place to start and/or end the night. If taking kids, they can only be in the dining room until dinner time. Totally chill and away from the Scottsdale scene. Bring a deck of cards..."
1,"Since the Elite event I have dropped in a few times and even brought my friend here for her very first legal drink at midnight and dinner. If she's going to have a drink, I want it to be the best kind of drinks possible. She liked it so I was pleased with my idea of coming.\n\nWhen I saw that we were going to UYE here, I had to go. I love this place and really what makes it for me is the love thats here and how the staff conveys their care into things. I adore Mike and Gerardo who are the keeper of the drinks, secrets and stories. \n\nStill lovely.\n\nI tried the Brandy Crusta (Brandy, Maraschino, Orange curacao, Lemon, Barrel Bitter) which was lovely, fresh, a bit pungent and sweet. I think this is so far one of my faves other than the Blackthorne.\n\nAlso got a Hemmingway Daquiri (Rum, Maraschino, Lime, Grapefruit). My writing didn't get any smarter, but my palette did. The description seemed simple and like I would know what it was going to taste like, but it was rather surprising and different. It had a grassy earthy tone to it that came through. \n\nMy goal is to try every single classic cocktail on the menu. 6 out of 19 so far. \n\nI got calamari because I like their take on here it. It wasn't as flavor packed as last time I had it.....it was more garlicky/herbaceous with it's sauce last time. Still good though. Batter is light, I love banana peppers and any kind of crispy pork product so it's a marriage of things I love.\n\nThe vibe is laidback and someplace where you can stay a while. I think the drink program is similar to  DCR so it's easy to try to compare them but I rather come here.  I won't be rushed out which I can feel they try hard to do when it gets busy at DCR. I don't see a personality there either- the bartender there is a bartender. Here they're Mike and G and you can get familiar with them. \n\nLike I said before, this is a place where I can take root at the bar waiting for my herbs&rye."
1,"I had never been to Cliffs but saw good reviews here, so being Sunday I called to see if he was open,, his answering machine picked up an I left a message, within 10 minutes he returned my call an said yes he was open come on down.  I thought this was great.  I took the bus there an he was all the previous reviewer said, great haircut making me look even more handsome :), with a massage at the end, good listener an great guy just overall.  Place is a museum filled with Western heritage. I can not tell you the price because Cliff's didn't tell me an only said what I thought would be fine, I don't think you will be disappointed. I highly recommend Cliff's Corral."
1,"I come in about once or twice a month. Service here is always impressive. I've never had a bad experience. Food is consistent. And, their email club sends out lots of coupons."
0,"I can't believe some of the reviews I'm reading, this is one of the worst italian restaurants in the city. I went with a group and they got the $5 pasta or pizza option. Their pizzazs came out burnt and tasteless. I ordered from the early bird menu and chose the stuffed shells. \""How could they screw that up?\"" I thought. The french onion soup was served with a block of barely melted mozzarella and burnt bread inside the soup. The broth was far too oily and tasteless. The salad fared little better. The house dressing was 90% oil, with the only saving grace being the marinated carrots. The shells were by far one of the worst things I've ever eaten. They were hard shells, filled with a gritty, salty cheese mixture in some of the rankest tomato sauce I have ever had. It tasted old and acidic and was so bad I only ate one shell. The early bird also included dessert and a choice of brownie or vanilla ice cream. I hoped to save the night with a nice small dish of vanilla ice cream, but what I got was a scoop of freezer-burned off-brand ice cream. \n\nI will never go back here again."
0,I just went here to get a shake and waited like 15 minutes in the drive thru. They messed up my order by putting hot fudge so when I got my shake it was like nuke warm. This was a horrible disappointment!!! Will never be going to this one again!
1,"I have been taking my English Bulldog here since he was a puppy. I like the facility - Its clean, large, indoor, and secure. I also like the fact that they let me into the back & the staff is incredible. The rates and hours are really reasonable!!"
0,"Nice people, small but dining area was clean. There are some cooked to order items but it's mainly food served up from heating trays, not sure how long it's been sitting out  either.  \n\nGot 3 items off the buffet sat down to eat, took a bite of pancit and it tasted a little off like noodles were spoiled, it smelled that way too. Ended up  throwing away my meal and walking out . I don't think I'll  be back..eww no."
0,"BEWARE!\n\nThis rating is NOT for Dr. Bracken but the dentist who bought his practice, as Dr.\nBracken just retired.\n\nUnfortunately, this new practice just  raised their prices 100% from what Dr Bracken used to charge and without telling you that prior to the cleaning and x-rays service  that my wife went for. I have been going to Dr bracken for 32 years and this new practice is lacking in every aspect of caring for your clients- welcome to the money grabbing health care.\nThe Dr. seemed uninterested  and hurried according to my wife.\nTime to look for an old school dentist ! \nI Don't mind paying a little more for good service and  and realizing we had it very lucky with Dr Bracken but DOUBLE the price and the attitude of this front office sucks!"
1,"Our dining experience here felt like we were invited to hang out at a very cool friend's very cool house with very delicious food. In spite of its ridiculously long wait-time to snag a reservation, the place is far from pretentious and the service was casual and warm.\n\nOur table wasn't quite ready when we walked in so we were invited to sit at the bar where the host poured us wine and made small talk, modestly downplaying the success of the restaurant, giving huge props to the great kitchen staff and talking about the various dishes on the menu as though they were children he could never be forced to choose between. \n\nEvery detail of the decor feels random and perfectly kitsch-y but expertly placed; from the makeshift library of cookbooks near the bar to the giant gallon of gin and six pack of bitters above our table.  The music was equally eclectic - from Dolly Parton to rap in one sitting!\n\nMy only pet peeve is chalkboard menus which force you to squint and invade other diners' personal space...but its a necessary evil of fresh cuisine. \n\nThe menu was seafood heavy on our visit; as a meat eater I asked our host for a suggestion and was directed to the \""chou-croute\""  which was a huge pot of sausage and cabbage with potatoes and a rich broth....impossible to finish but delicious!\n\nOur waitress, Samia, was fantastic. Sensing how full we were after dinner she brought us a serving of their home-made ice cream - a light concoction of rum and pineapple and all manner of goodness - and chatted with us like an old friend. \n\nThe prices were more than reasonable - an entree, main, glass of wine and tea came in at under $60. \n\nDefinitely worth the wait for a reservation!"
0,"Sweet Baby Jesus, can't a girl please find decent poutine in Lawrenceville? I thought you'd be my savior Frankuary, instead you've left me totally confused and questioning my faith. \n\nBack in the day (college days to be specific) I loved the Frantuary. I am wondering if I was maybe just drunk? These days, I get really irritated when I cannot get a calorie free beverage aside from water in a restaurant. I honestly cannot tolerate drinking plain tap water with food and no, no I do not want your hipster Boylan's, OK?! I get it, you don't want me to die from terrible chemicals or high fructose corn syrup. But a Diet Pepsi MIGHT have made your blasphemous rip on poutine more tolerable. \n\nProbably not.  \n\nAnyway, we ordered 2 plates of Poutine Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. It was bland and didn't have enough cheese curds. My friend stopped eating his after the curds were gone. Since there were 5 on his place, more than half the fries were left. I ate more of mine because I was hungry, but did not finish my plate (which is basically unheard of, as I am a glutton). Gravy was totally tasteless. No salt and tasted like it was thickened with corn starch. A really, really WEAK dish that needs to be totally reworked or taken off the menu. \n\nI don't know, I guess because my previous positive experiences, I would give Frankuary a chance to atone for their transgressions but no any time soon."
1,I stopped in here on a trip to scotland in May. What a great little find. The potatoes were awesome and the gentleman working that day was wonderful. Definitely worth a pop in if you're in the area.
1,"My husband and I snagged a travelzoo voucher and decided to stay here for a night. The resort is beautiful and the staff is extremely friendly. If you're looking for a quiet and quaint getaway this is the place to go. The pool was smaller than expected but we were there in July so it wasn't crowded and the cabana staff was very accommodating. My two issues were the food menu was quite limited (although they do offer a happy hour which is nice, but only offer certain foods at certain times, which is frustrating), and my pedicure at the spa was below average."
1,Our family always enjoys a night a spinatos. We always request Lorenzo as our server.
0,"Took a friend here for his birthday tonight. The appetizer would have been good had it it been one of the treats you're brought before the meal. It was the clam Po' Boy. Each white bread little bun had two .75 inch clams and some delicious sauce. Our entrees were good; he had the steak, I had the salmon. The most disappointing part of the meal was the dessert. He had the chocolate and mint and I had the strawberry something. Imagine what a 7th grader puts together as a final home Ec project that sits in the fridge for a few days until parents come in for your class presentation. The chocolate was like a choco-jello mix that's been sitting out for too long. My strawberry thing was on a pastry that I simply couldn't cut through with a spoon it was so hard. For special occasions I recommend Christopher's or Vincent's. I took a risk tonight and it didn't pay off."
1,"YUM! Loved the drink, loved the service. Had the pleasure of meeting JJ and having a really good pumpkin latte, hot. They use pumpkin puree for this drink not  flavored syrup (yay). It was the perfect temperature and not too sweet which is great for me because I don't like added sugar or extra calories. This stop was a win for me."
1,"I love this place!  It smells divine and they make their own wine.  What more do you need?  Carlo's Garage Winery is located in the basement of the cafe and oh baby is this a hidden gem!  The grapes are from Cali and the wine is from the basement; it reminds me of stories that my grandmother would tell me about her Italian relatives who make wine\n\nI am a fan of their Americanos and cappuccinos and their biscotti and oh my everything.  The people are so friendly, even on a busy Monday-before-Christmas lunch rush.  I can't wait to go back for an actual meal in the cafe."
0,"Seriously, Not Impressed. Here's why. \n\nThe Good: \nPremade foods. They have lots and lots of choices. \nLunchmeats and Cheeses: They carry Boar's Head. The full line of it. And when I say full line I can't do it justice. \nThey do carry odds and ends you can't find anywhere else. You want a Vienna Beef Chicago Style Hotdog or Polish Sausage Dog? They got the real thing. \nInternational food: They carry a modest selection of things that I've seen elsewhere so if you live close by you can save some time by buying it here. \nLike Apples? They carry some varieties you don't see very often. \n\nThe Bad:\nWhen you look closer the product mix is weird. They have high end and ultra high end stuff mixed in with Western Family and Springfield generic lines. \nGood luck talking to anyone in the butcher shop, I tried twice. \nThe premade salads right up front had the visual appeal of Purina puppy chow that got splashed into a dog's water bowl. Mushy, yucky, slimy, bleech. \nProduce: For a place that carries international food their produce section is downright small and limited. One type of eggplant for example, Albertsons carries more varieties. \nThe piped in music lulls one to semi-consciousness so you don't notice the problems this store has.\nThey have a token beer and wine selection that barely warrants the floor space and cost of the liquor licenses they have to maintain for it. \n\nThe Ugly: \nPricing. Does anyone in Vegas comparison shop? If you were price conscious you would spot things right away. I didn't take the time to write down everything I saw but I could easily come up with a 30 item list where prices are 30 to 35 cents higher for the same items, some things were over $1 more, and I saw some items that I can get way cheaper elsewhere in Vegas saving $3 or more per item. And we're not even going to begin to compare them with Winco on basic items. \nProduce Quality: Overpriced, overripe avocados shows someone isn't paying attention to what's put on display as an example of several other quality problems this store has. \n\nIn short...count me among the unimpressed and the ones who will likely not go back."
1,Long Drive thru line. But its easy in and out of there. What else can i say about star bucks that you dont already know. :)
1,"My wife and I are visiting from Austin for my birthday and wanted to have a special birthday dinner.  I checked reviews in yelp for a good steakhouse and came across this restaurant. I had not heard of it before but when I saw the very high ratings decided to give it a try. All I can say is AMAZING!  The service was excellent!  Make sure you ask for Mike. He was a excellent waiter. He took his time answering all of our questions and his service was prompt and personal. The food was super delicious.  I had the ribeye cooked hard medium. Talk about juicy and full of flavor! I'm a firm believer that a good steak does not need steak sauce and brother let me tell you absolutely no steak sauce needed. Same for my wife, she had a filet (Oscar style). I paired my steak with a grilled lobster tail. OMG, talk about good. For our sides (ala cart) we had the saute asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes. Both very flavorful.  We paired our meal with wine. I had a perfect balanced Summerland Pinot (flavor was heavier than some Pinots but not as heavy as a Cab). My wife had a Jaylor Cab (pretty sure I spelled it wrong). She loved it with the crab and steak.  By the way the crab meat was large whole chunks.  Amazing!  For dessert Mike brought me a smaller version of their butter cake. OMG, OMG!!! I'm a huge chocolate fan and very rarely do I eat anything else, but this cake was phenomenal.  You have to try it.  That's all I will say. \n\nAnyway I hope this helps. You can not go wrong with this restaurant.  Heck, we initially sat behind Shania Twain but moved because other people in her party were a little loud and we wanted a quiet dinner experience.  From what we were told, they always have celebrities visiting. \n\nForgot to mention that we stayed at the Aria.  Which is right next to the Crystal Shops, where the restaurant is. Check them out too. \n\nEnjoy!"
0,"This review is more about the Tiffany Company, but this store just happened to be the messenger I'm about to shoot.\n\nI like this store a lot--it's two stories, the top one containing watches and accessories and the bottom featuring everything sparkly. The sales associates are relatively friendly (some are very friendly, most act uninterested but will talk to you if you approach them,) the doormen are always friendly and, well, it's Tiffany.\n\nOver the last three years (since I started my first \""real\"" job,) I've purchased three sterling silver pieces, the first of which was one of the \""charm bracelet\"" necklaces with a heart pendant from the flagship Tiffany in New York. The later two were gifts for my mom. Today, we brought in all three pieces for a long overdue cleaning.\n\nThe bill? Wait, there's a bill? $15 per item. FOR A CLEANING. Yes, not only are you going to pay several hundred dollars for a piece of Tiffany jewelry, but they're more than happy to charge you more to dip it in their ~special~ Tiffany cleaning solution (I imagine it's colored Tiffany blue) and make you wait three hours. We decided to clean ours at home.\n\nOne of my girlfriends brought her engagement ring for a cleaning and had it done within minutes for free. Tiffany only offers complimentary cleaning for gold and platinum pieces; their very popular sterling silver pieces are apparently inferior, which is how you're going to feel if you bring yours into the store.\n\nAs a student of hospitality, I judge all businesses on customer service. Despite its reputation, Tiffany fails when it comes to treating customers well. As a college student working part-time, I don't have a lot of money to spend here, but even if I do in the future, Tiffany will have already lost my business. \n\nNote: You may have seen this review before. I accidentally posted it on the Bellagio store's page, but meant to put it on the Forum Shop store's page."
0,"What happened!? :( I came here with my mom about a week after they opened and the food was fresh and yummy and the service was amazing!! Not sure what her name was but she was friendly and we had some great convo with her. Since our first visit went so well we decided to come here again for my 21st birthday. Our waiter Jonathan (spanish guy) was terrible; he didn't have a warm personality, he barely spoke to us.. no small talk or anything. He didn't get us any water. When he brought out the food he dropped it and left without a word. I wanted barbecue sauce and my mom wanted water. I ended up asking the bartender for it since Jonathan went m.i.a.. He didn't ask us if everything tasted good or if we needed anything.  I've never had a waiter that bad before. He ruined my birthday lunch!\n\n\nP.S.  When I had the ribs my first visit, they were hot and fresh; this visit we could tell they had been made before hand... like WAY before hand and my mom's mashed potatoes were extremely dry. I guess since there settled in they don't think they have to work as hard?.."
0,"While we were happy with the quality of the cabinets we received here, the customer service was abysmal. If you don't mind not getting phone calls returned and constantly badgering for the latest status, go somewhere else. You might end up paying a little more, but it will be worth it in the end."
0,"Roaches on the bar? Kitchen closed at 10;15 PM? What happened to this place? YUCK!!!! Caught a roach on the bar and put it in a glass upside down. No apology, the barkeep just put it on the other side of the bar near other employees standing around talking!! The counter was dirty and there was trash on the floor and under all the counters!! Where is the health commission? I used to love this place but I can't drink and not eat. dui alley is right there and it's only 10:15!! Still very hungry sounds like bad management. Thank god off site betting keeps them alive but damn this place is filthy. They should be embarrassed but I will take my business back Mellow Mushroom where the kitchen is always open and the bar is clean"
0,Got their burger and wings no flavor what's so ever. Huge disappointment. One star cause service was ok.
0,i  went  to the Todd English P.U.B thinking it would be great and it started  that  way and  then the food came i had a grilled cheese with brie and bacon it was kida good  my brother had a chili dog it was not so good and  my mom got  the lobster rolls  they were also  disappointing and so were the desserts but the atmosphere was great and the service was good but i don't think i will be eating here  again.
0,"Went to look at cars. Went through the usual steps of negotiations. I won. I'm sure they were disappointed, so, they tried adding hidden \""accessories\"" at signing. I noticed, called them out on it, and instead of an explanation, the finance guy got angry and threw the paper work at us. I walked out! \n\nPOOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. And SLEEZY business practices. \n\nMAKE SURE YOU REALLY DO THE MATH AT SIGNING WITH THESE GUYS."
0,"I am waiting for one of the underage children to get in a horrendous accident and this place get shut down. The \""promoter\"" for this club gets girls who he KNOWS are underage.  I personally am disgusted with their practices and if it continues will most definitely report them to the authorities."
0,The people at the store are friendly. That's the nicest thing I can say. After selecting and ordering a custom sofa- five weeks into a six week order- the woman who placed it called to tell me that the manufacturer (Jonathan Louis) called to tell them that the frames weren't being made. I have two issues with this- 1. Why wasn't anyone checking on the progress of the order for the customer? 2. Why is Mod Home doing business with a shoddy manufacturer who doesn't give them the heads up that they shouldn't be selling a product because it's being discontinued? There is a MAJOR communication  problem here between the store and manufacturer and I'm the one left holding the bag. I was just about to call them to ask when my sofa was going to be ready. Now I'm going elsewhere- and I'm way behind in having a sofa for my new house. This store won't get my business again. The woman actually had the audacity to ask when I'd be back in. I resisted- but the answer is never.
1,"if you go upstairs and down an unmarked alleyway you'll find some of the best pizza in las vegas\n\nthis place is really good but the problem is its not that consistent. \n\nits ok because it hit the spot both times i came here!\n\ni liked how this is a secret unmarked place \n\nthe pizza is very well made. not too much sauce, just the right amount of cheese and thin crust!"
0,"Extremely poor seating layouts, be prepared to pay 50% extra on top of your $10.00 ticket for \""premium seats\"" that are really the only seats that allow you to watch the movie without breaking your neck or sitting next to a wall."
0,"In AZ with wifey dear and she was on business.  On the recommendation of a friend we hit this place up.  its sunday nite,  just another table dining.   As you walk in there is a outdoor section, some open tables with cushion seatin on one side and open lighting, nice ambiance.  Inside decor is A plus, very nice and romatic if you are here for an intimate dinner.  I really wanted to be wowed by this place by the food, but sadly it wasnt wow, it wasnt bad but it didnt have that make me want to come back factor.  Ordered some Mac and Cheese with smoked turkey, the smoked turkey was sliced deli meat chopped in.  I was sadly dissapointed given the $15 bucks price tag.  Dinner for two Mac and Cheese, Chicken Pot Pie (again sliced deli meat inside) , wifey had one drink,  I opted for water, creme brulee desert, two drinks $65 inc tip.  I dont think this place is going to get a return visit next time I am in town.  The decor gets an A+ from me, but the food is lacking some wowness.  Thank goodness I didnt have the glass of wine, I dont think it would of made the experience any better."
1,"Decent food, decent service.  Great for stopping in with my daughter for a quick bit.  She would give a 5 star review for the cool car they delivery the kids meals in."
0,"My dog has fine hair that naturally tangles and, despite the daily brush, gets slightly matted at times in a couple of spots; when I say slightly, I mean it: I can fix it with a comb in just a few minutes.\n It used to be no problem when we lived in another state, where I would take her to a Petsmart salon and she would come out with a nice cut. \nHere, at this location, they don't bother brushing her and insist on shaving her every single time, plus they charge extra for having to deal with matted hair. \nIt feels as if they look for the easiest way to deal with her rather than give full attention. \n\nMust off to find a more dedicated groomer."
0,"With two 4-star reviews I thought I was in for a treat. There was lots of food, but none of it was fresh. I tried a few items and they were all old and luke-warm at best. Since none of the food looked good, I thought I would try the hibatchi grill. I piled up my plate with some food and looked around only to see no one available to grill my food. I placed my plate on the edge of the grill and wandered around for several minutes before someone finally came out. To make matters worse, the chef intended on giving me unflavored food with no self-serve sauces available. When I asked to have sauce on my grilled food he said that only soy sauce was available. None of the ingredients were quality (dark meat chicken and old veggies), and with no sauce, the dish was flavorless. \n\nI asked the waitress when hot, fresh food would be coming. She asked the manager, who was eating his dinner while doing something with his laptop, and she came back and mentioned that there's no specific time for fresh food to come out, but it would be coming in waves. I arrived at 4:15pm and left at 5:30pm, during which time trays sat empty and only the lo mein, pot stickers, fried rice and teriyaki chicken was replaced. I tried the new teriyaki chicken, but it tasted old and was also just luke-warm, almost like it had been cooked early in the morning and sitting in the back all day. After striking out on everything else, I tried some pizza. I literally spit out the only bite I took because it tasted like they used ketchup instead of pizza sauce. I ended up eating the only edible items on the buffet -- fruit and salad -- for dinner."
1,"First off, cheers to a place that takes its mixology seriously.  There were only a couple options (the bartender said there are more coming soon since they are seasonal), but order the Manhattan - seriously (if you like that kind of drink). It's like an Impressionist painting of a Manhattan - you can definitely see the classic through the brush-strokes, but man, they just take it to an artistic level - taste, process, presentation...\n\nNow take into account that I was there on a Monday evening, but the place was empty. Me, my buddy, and one other guy. It was even happy hour time, so prices were really reasonable. So everyone go! Keep thoughtful, crafty places in downtown successful!"
1,"Really good place. Seems to be owned and run like a true New Yorker. Pizza slices are generous. Although they have a full italian menu, I can only speak for the pizza. This place is good! \n\nYou can keep it pretty cheap if you stick to cheese or pepperoni. But with that said, they have many exciting looking pizza varieties, but expect to pay a significant premium over a slice of cheese to try one."
0,"In 2007 I moved out of Pensacola on orders from the Navy. All my bills with COX were set up to be paid automatically from my account but just to make sure, when I turned in my equipment I asked the clerk at the desk to confirm that everything was paid in full. She confirmed that I had no balance and I moved to my next duty station.\n\nNow 5 years later, I'm trying to buy a house and suddenly COX sends a claim to a collections agency that I owed about $58;. The agency reports it to the credit bureaus and overnight, my credit score drops 100 points?. I call COX to try to resolve the false claim and they insist the only solution is that I have to pay them this money.\n\nFor $50 I would gladly avoid the whole situation and pay money I don't owe but to pay at this point is useless, the \""late\"" payment remains on my report screwing up my credit for years to come. \n\nIf that isn't bad enough, at no point did they try to contact me,. I'm pretty sure they had my email on file and I know they had my phone number (I've never changed my cell phone number). So I had no idea this false charge even existed until February 2012 when all the sudden it lands on my credit report."
0,"I was in town for a trade show and after walking the show floor for 10 hrs my feet were aching. I googled Vegas foot massage and found \""best foot spa\"" with several 5 star reviews so I decided to give it a try..the massage was one of the worst I have ever had.  I did not complain about the massage. I let the guy finish and went to the counter to pay. My total was $43 and I gave the guy a $50 and started out the door  when he made the comment \""just $7 huh\""  insinuating that the tip wasn't large enough. I was standing out front waiting on a cab when a guy that I assume was the owner came out and introduced himself as Rex and asked me how I liked the massage. He seemed very concerned so I gave him my opinion. He apologized and told me next time I come to ask for him and he would personally do my massage, however I only travel here once every 5 years or so. I do appreciate Rex offering to do that but he should have made sure I got a decent massage the first time."
1,Great place!! First time trying the custard! \nA.M.A.Z.I.N.G!! Loved the mango and vanilla! Will definitely return!
0,"I used to eat here at least twice a month, but lately the quality of the food has fallen. The fettuccine Alfredo with chicken in particular has  really gone down hill. Half the amount of chicken they used to serve, and the sauce has lost some of it's consistency. It's now sort of starchy and tasteless. \n\nI have started looking for another place to get my Italian fix.\n\nAlso the staff has turned from the friendly people they used to be to snobbish and rude."
0,"I'm surprised by the glowing reviews that are on here about this place. I bought a Groupon for this place based on the good reviews. The Bf and I made the trek down there tonight from mesa. Well..... the place is nothing to look at, just a little store front that kind of looks like an order at the counter kind of place but there is table service. So I ended up ordering the spinach ravioli and the BF got the 'park place' sandwich. My ravioli came with a salad, and I got a caesar. It tasted bland and like the dressing came out of a bottle. I wouldn't recommend it. My dinner also was supposed to come with bread.... it never came. My raviolis were fine in flavor, they came out warm...not hot.... and seemed like they came from a package, not fresh. The sauce was a standard marinara. The portion was not overly large, not ridiculously small though either. The BF was informed that they were out of all breads except the standard sesame seed. His sandwich was basically swiss, roast beef, and turkey. The bread was hard and the sandwich was bland. I could have had better at the grocery store. Since we still had money left on the groupon, we decided to order the tiramisu. It was supposedly home made. Well if it was.... someone who knows nothing about tiramisu made it. It was extremely dry and had no coffee flavor at all. In fact, it tasted like dry cinnamon.... not what a tiramisu should taste like. Also, the 'mascarpone' part tasted more like frosting (?). This was one of the worst tiramisus I have ever had. So, needless to say, I won't be back."
1,"Bought a groupon for this place.  $10 for $20 worth of food.  Went on a Saturday morning and it wasn't too busy.\n\nI ordered the half rack of ribs ($13.99) which came with six rib bones and two sides (I got sweet potato fries and coleslaw).  The ribs were tender and the fries were delicious.  The coleslaw, eaten by my fiance, was just okay.  He got the pulled pork sandwich ($5.99) and enjoyed it.  It was messy but good he said.  We shared a drink and wound up only having an additional $4 and change to pay on our bill.\n\nThis was a yummy lunch and the groupon made it even more awesome.  Worth a visit!"
1,"I've gotten my industrial, cartilage, and navel piercings done here, and I love them all. The place and the guys who run the place look a little intimidating, but they're actually really friendly! Their piercing station is clean, and they make your experience better because they'll calm you down and stuff. They also throughly tell you how to care for your piercings. The prices aren't too bad, maybe a little pricey, but because they do a good job, I think it's worth it. Plus the piercing price includes the jewelry. It's been a while, but I think I paid $50 for my industrial, and my cartilage and navel were both either $30 or $35."
1,I like this club although kind of small you can't go wrong with Wynn/ Encore clubs.  They have good bottle prices and usually play hip hop.  The outside patio/ waterfall make for a cool unique ambiance.  Bartenders are very nice.
1,"I really enjoy coming here.  The selection of produce keeps getting better and better.  I really hope they keep this market as produce, jams, oils, fresh eggs and meats oppose to Scottsdale restaurants.  McClendon's produce has a great selection of seasonal produce AND other organic produce farmer's are finally coming to Old Town.\n\nBring your friendly dog, try all the samples, buy, buy, buy and support our local farmers and small business owners.  It's a great way to spend a Saturday morning."
0,"I went yesterday with my friend, having bought a groupon that covered the session fee, hair, makeup, a dvd slide show, and one 8x10.  The appointment was easy to make, and they called to confirm 2 days before the appointment, which is always appreciated because sometimes you forget.\n\nThere is one viewing area, where they can do one session at a time, towards the front.  It is not private, so if you are doing boudoir photos, I hope you're not exactly shy.  There's a partition up to shield it from the passing public's view, but there's no privacy if someone comes in to book an appointment, or even just stands in the hallway.  Not many people want to do boudoir photos and have them easily viewed by everyone that passes by.  The area in the back could have been set up as an additional viewing area, it would be more private, and cut down on waiting times.\n\nThere is only a set of curtains that is used when a session is going, and I witnessed a family passing by, and their child peeking in on people.  Again, I hope you're not shy!\n\nThis business needs a THOROUGH scrub down.  There was debris from different props all over the ground, the floor was scuffed up and dirty (and they expected you to sit on it in your panties if you were doing boudoir photos), there was a musty smell about the whole place, I can only imagine what would come up from the carpets in a proper cleaning, and the bathrooms were absolutely cringe worthy.  There was no attempt to clean the room between customers and the employees seemed to take no pride in their work place.  There were photographers and hair and makeup people sitting around.  No one cleaned anything, except the hair and makeup people keeping their stations tidy (good job ladies!)  I'm willing to bet when it's quitting time, no one runs a vacuum or sweeps anything, it's lock up and run for the exit.\n\nThere was nowhere to store your things for outfit changes, so when you're going between each of the sections of the room (and they will make you move, taking pictures against every single background), you have to move your things (or store them in the hallway, risking theft.)\n\nThey made no attempt, when booking the appointment, to ask if a female or male photographer would be preferred, knowing it was for a boudoir session.  If a doctor's office can ask this question, surely it's easy for a photography studio to ask!  The female photographer there that day (only one), was alright, but she really isn't well versed at photographing girls that are not on the skinny supermodel side of the size spectrum in a flattering light.  The male photographer that I had was annoying.  He asked inappropriate questions (like asking if my friend wanted to have children), and attempted to get me into poses that were uncomfortable.  I had to draw the line at a pose that would have had my breasts falling completely out of my outfit, the angle and pose was so unnatural.\n\nThe poses are all manufactured and the same for everyone.  Some of them are awkward and unnatural, leaving the person looking uncomfortable and maybe a little scared they're going to fall.  No wonder a lot of the terrible Glamour Shots poses from the 90's had people looking absolutely terrified.\n\nThe makeup is not tailored to each person.  They used the same neutral palette on both of us, and it's a normal 4 shades of brown application that one would do for a smoky eye.  When asked what we wanted for hair, I'm not sure what my friend said, but I know I said I was looking for a pin up, vintage style.  It was a side part with curls.  That's it.  Everyone got a side part with curls, so I suppose everyone was going for a pin up, vintage style that wasn't actually pin up or vintage?\n\nThe $450 value assigned to the groupon was bullshit.  No one would pay $300 for that dvd slideshow.  It's set to crappy music, the Glamour Shots logo is all over the photos (distractingly so), and it includes their \""retouched photos\"" which look overly processed and filtered.  Seriously, learn photoshop people!  I'm 30, I don't need to look 12 with you erasing all of my laugh lines and smoothing out my skin so I look like a Botoxed Barbie.  I would have gladly traded the dvd slideshow for more prints, but that was not an option.\n\nI did not spend any extra money there because I was so disappointed in the entire experience.  The only reason that we'll be back is to pick up our pictures, but after that, not again.  We were there for nearly 7 hours, which is an obscene amount of time to spend in a place that isn't your job."

1,"I only found this clinic because my Saint Bernard's doctor, Dr. Ashley Greenway, began working there. I cannot praise her enough. She is a marvelous doctor. She is brilliant, straight forward, and honest. My Saint Bernard has a slew of oddball heath problems, from entropion and corneal issues to allergies to ear infections; and she has quickly and accurately dealt with them all. She is always super patient with him, even though he is pretty much a complete spazz. \n\nThe clinic boasts a staff of HIGHLY skilled technicians, who have veterinary experience ranging from emergency medicine to surgery, and are dang near doctors themselves. \n\nThe clinic is peaceful, cozy and it is easy to feel at home. Please stop by and meet the awesome staff and our favorite veterinarian in the valley!"
1,"Buffalo Wild Wings beats the heck out of \""Other wing restaurants\"" any day of the week. Their wings are insanely good. They have about a dozen different sauces ranging from mild to \""Blazin\"". \n\nI love their craft beer selection. That's actually my downfall there, I could try a different beer every visit. Carbo-load!\n\nThey show UFC with NO cover-- bonus points. \n\nLast night, we decided to \""try something new\"". We usually go for their mango habanero and hot wings. We went with their \""Asian Zing\"" and \""Carribean Jerk\"". The Asian wings were delicious. We asked for them well done, They came out in 18 minutes--a little long for a wing ticket time-- I've been in the restaurant business for years. Wings should only take 8 minutes, or 10 for well done. The Carribean Jerk, on the other hand were yucky. They tasted like clove and cinnamon. I'm not used to carribean flavors, so I'm not sure if that's an acceptable flavor but to me-- never again. Cinnamon belongs in dessert, not dinner. \n\n\nWe also ordered their triple play nachos, three different types of nachos in one huge heaping pile of fattening delicious-ness. \n\nPrices: They have a killer happy hour. Beer is either $3. $4. or $5. and all of their apps are half off."
1,"Visited this location yesterday and I had to write a review for their awesome Baja sandwich.  It was a tad spicy (Chipotle mayo) and savory (bbq sauce).  I liked that they toast their sandwiches before handing it to you.  The guy (sorry i forgot to look at your name tag) didn't hesitate to give me veggies on this sandwich even though it usually doesn't come with any.  :) \n\nWe also order ...I believe it was the mesquite sandwich...It must've been from eating the tasty Baja that I found this sandwich to be more bland.  \n\n\n Service was professional.  The sandwich was good.  Can't complain but rather, just compliment.  I'll be coming back."
1,"If you've been to Piccolo Forno once, you love it. You know you do. Such a great place complete with a terrific atmosphere, amazingly fresh and authentic Italian food, and its BYOB!! What more could you want? Oh, yeah, the crowds not being there, I get it. But here's a hint, go early. But those that go are in the know. There's a reason people flock here. It's that good.\n\nWe've been a few times and are always anxious to go back. Yep, we've had pizza of all sorts (with our wine), pasta of all sorts (with our bottle of wine), soups and salads (yep, you guessed it, with our wine) and EVERYTHING has been amazing. The salads are imaginative and filled with fresh ingredients. The pasta is delicious and varied to the point you can get braised boar or braised rabbit with it if you're so inclined. The spinach tagliatelle with the tomato and olive lamb ragu is a clear winner. Or you can try one of my favorites - the Tortelli - yummy dough pockets filled with a blend of pork and beef in a spectacular Bolognese sauce. And the pizzas? Wood fired delights that are covered with fresh mozzarella and a selection of toppings that would make your Italian grandmother envious. I like the Margherita with the option of adding prosciutto, speck, tuna, and gorgonzola.  Eat here. Bring lots of wine. Sit back and enjoy. Oh, and save me a seat."
0,"Owner is a greedy crook.\n\nSupreme pizza is $8.50, hawaiian is $6.50. Ordered half hawaiian/half supreme. When I picked up the pizza, the owner charged $13.50 for an 8 dollar pizza. What kind of scam is the owner trying to run?! \n\nThe d-bag owner tried to give some BS excuse that he doesn't do half/half on pizzas & instead doubles the toppings on each half of a single pizza. WTF?! I didn't order double toppings, a-hole. Of course he doesn't tell you this when you order, he waits until you're picking up your pizza, charges you and hopes you don't notice the 70% mark-up on the price.\n\nHe then tried to explain that his way is cheaper by telling me that two large pizzas would have been $15 and he's doing me a favor and saving me money. So what you just told me is that because of your little scam I just paid $13 for one pizza when I could have paid $15 for two pizzas?! You just made yourself look like an even more of an A-hole, dude.\n\nHow anyone believes they can get away with trying to rip people off in the age of the internet is beyond me.\n\nP.S. I called 4 other Little Caesars franchises in the area and none of them charge 70% extra do a half/half pizza."
1,"I have been in some crazy places, but me in a baby slash maternity store is kind of bonkers, especially since I don't have kids and I am not buying a baby gift. Hmmmm, how did I get here?  Well, we were wandering around East Blvd and we popped in this cute place. \n\nIf you ever need a baby gift, they have baby t shirts and onsies with 'you had me at hello' 'I might barf', 'clowns to the right of me, jokers to the left' and 'been nowhere done nothing'.  They had pacifier clip on thingies, (so little careless babies won't loose their pacifiers and cry like little babies) that looked like candy necklaces.  The ladies working were also very nice to us, even though we looked very out of place.\n\nThere are all kinds of breast feeding contraptions, bras and such for expectant moms.  You boys be careful out there, so you won't have to shop at these places."
0,"If is a big headliner don't bother going... I went to see Janes Addiction 5/9/2014 and what a HUGE disappointment. The stage is sunk down so those folks in the back can not see a thing- people constantly pushing and bumping you to get a better spot. I finally had to leave. I Understand this is a rock concert, I go to many, but this was the worst Venue lay-out I have ever seen. On the way out we expressed our disappointment to the manager -- he had nothing to say, just gave us a blank look and shrugged his shoulders.  Why they wouldn't raise the stage is beyond me- horrible! Don't waste your money like I did.\nPs There was lots of confusion by everyone while trying to get in the place-- it was not clear why you were standing in line ( was it to by tickets, will call or just to get in with your ticket already purchased ) Security guards were RUDE -- get some organization- it was a cluster ****!"
1,"I came to paymon's for the first time with two girlfriends. Both of my girlfriends eat at paymon's frequently and suggested that we go there before a concert and have dinner. When I got there we had a table and the waitress was nice. We ordered the combination plater and a side of athens fries. The food was absolutely amazing. Hummus, pita, stuffed grape leaves, cucumber yogurt dip,  and more came with this plater. Paymon's has various different food choices and anyone can enjoy eating there.  I plan on eating there again and I would recommend paymon's to anyone."
0,"If ur not into beef or pork, then u probably shouldn't eat here because mostly all there soups are beef/pork based (even their chicken pho). They give u a tomato based option, but it just ruins the whole pho experience! I did not want tomato soup! \nAlso, our kids got a chicken tender meal which was suppose to come with soda, that they didn't get til after they ate because the waiter forgot. Ended up taking the can drinks home. The waiters r friendly, just forgetful.\nSo, guess we'll be eating at any other pho place, because this is the only one that didn't have chicken based soups, or veggie based soups."

0,Visited Dillon's Grand last night for the first time.  It's located in Sun City Grand on the golf course.  Nice views of the course and lake.  Older crowd.  The onion rings were very good.  The food is average and seemed a little pricy for what you get.  I had the pulled pork . . . they served it with a hard hamburger bun on the side (which I didn't even bother with).  All in all . . . it's OK.  We ordered the nachos and I must say they were pretty good.\nNot sure I'd go back . . . I'll wait until I get a little older.
1,I might have come to this place sooner if it were not so close to Tott's! But I am glad I finally tried it. It is very good and I can alleviate my friends from my Pita Jungle invites !  I want to go back and try the swarm as that I kept seeing others order. I had the gyro platter and was not disappointed . I am particularly picky withy Mediterranean fare having lived in Grece. I am not sure but I think this one is more Lebanese .
1,"Almost a year ago, I inherited a coin and stamp collection. Both of which I knew very little about. I put them aside, hoping to find the time to research what I had. Some time later they came up in a conversation. My friends wife then told me about PV Coin & Jewelry. She had stopped in the store with a bracelet that needed to be fixed. While there, the owner was helping someone with a stamp collection. She had said how comfortable she felt and suggested that I give them a call. A few days later I took in my stamp collection and coins. Jonah was very knowledgable and generous with his offer. I did a bit more research and took my collection to a few other dealers only to find Jonah's quote was by far the best. Thanks Jonah for all your help!"
0,Ambiance: Good\nRoom: Average (poor considering this is a luxury chain)\nService/Concierge: N/A (not used)\nParking:Not used\nLocation: Excellent (without car) as its right above the VIA rail and connected to STM\nFor a Fairmont this place is a surprise. My exposure to this chain of hotels has been limited to dinning as I usually stick to another chain of hotel (loyalty cards make you pick a chain and stick to it :) or hotwire in most cases. However we got a good rate and a 2 bedroom was necessity which rules out using hotwire (not guaranteed)/\nThe hotel was booked solid and I was offered a free breakfast if I took a smoking room(bleh). The room was on the 4th floor and the walkaway had a clear cigarette smell so I wasn't sure I got right room (I found out later that the floor above had smoking rooms hence the smoke smell leaks on the floor below).\nThe room was minuscule and the old style furniture it was completely overwhelmed and there was barely any room to walk around let alone put stuff.  \nThe washroom didn't fare better  as the layout is very poor and the shower took forever to drain. One of the friend's got upgraded to a suite since they have the Platinum status on the Fairmont Club. For a suite I think the room was underwhelming as well. \nThe location is quite good as its few min from the main drag and is located on the transport hub. \nWill I stay here again hmm not likely.
1,"I recently received a tattoo from Krystof at Bluenote Tattoo, and I could not be happier with the results! \n\nI wanted to add another tattoo to my body to commemorate my recent marriage. Since the artist who did my first tattoo had left Las Vegas a couple years back, I needed to work with someone new.  Luckily for me, I did my homework and found the good folks at Bluenote Tattoo. I can't say enough good things about their shop - very clean, welcoming atmosphere which makes for a very kick-ass place to spend some time (6.5 hours in my case) getting your ink done. \n\nKrystof (and his fellow artists, each of Ink Master fame) do a really quality job. While I have seen reviews here mentioning the price was a bit higher than others, I didn't find that to be the case. That said, whatever your perspective, the quality of the work you will receive will be well worth any extra dollars you may spend... Trust me, you will be seeing the art for a long time, don't be cheap now and regret it later.\n\nI would (and do) recommend this shop to anyone looking for their first/next tattoo. Between the great artistry, welcoming atmosphere, and award winning talent... I can't imagine a better shop in Vegas."

0,"What a disappointment. If you have ever had mexican food before do not come here. I may be from California but that doesn't mean I have some extraordinarily high standards cause I've been an expat for almost a decade now... so my standards have gone down a bit. Also my partner is from Glasgow and wholeheartedly agrees that this place SUCKS. \n\nI never knew one could mess up salsa, but even with all the choices you have for your burrito ours tasted like an uninspired insipid mess of  \""stuff\"". Not even real food, but stuff that you're not sure what it is cause it all tastes in the same flavorless way. I can't even describe how disappointed I was cause its SO HARD to mess up assembly line burritos! I mean just add some onions, garlic and tomato concentrate to white rice and there you have some tasty mexican rice, Flavor folks! I wish I could get into that kitchen and teach their staff how to cook easy, tasty mexican food.\n\nIf there were awards for flavorless food joint this place would take first in my book. Its over priced and seriously bland stuff."
1,"I went to Bravo Bistro last night to attend a Yelp Recruiting Mixer and it was a great experience! I was only there for a few hours and had a couple pita chips with humus and a few beers (which were on the house!) and the service was amazing. Any time my drink was gone a server was right there to get me another one, and on two occasions the owner Tony came up to take my drinks. \n\nTony and I actually had a long conversation on the patio about his restaurant and the spot he does on 3TV. He is an extremely down to earth and intelligent guy who really is passionate about his business! I look forward to coming here again and again!"

1,"Don't let the strip mall setting deter you.  This restaurant has some of the best tasting fish in town.  When you walk in, the servers are very friendly and quick to seat you.  They recently expanded so it doesn't feel as cramped as before.  The quality of the tuna is the best I've had in town.  When you bite down your teeth easily cut through the fish while keeping a good tuna consistency.  The prices are not inflated like your typical Scottsdale sushi restaurant.  They even have appetizer specials where you buy a bottle of Kirin and you get a choice of 6 appetizers for only $.50!  I highly recommend this place to any fan of great sushi with equal service."
0,"We wanted to give this place a chance because the atmosphere is lovely, but after multiple visits, I must say that we will not be returning. The food is mediocre at best, and overpriced as well. Portions are small (i ordered the $14 crab cake appetizer and a bowl of vegetable soup and received 2 mushy crab cakes the size of fifty cent pieces and half a bowl of flavorless broth with literally 3 pieces of unidentifiable vegetable floating in it) My husband had pork \""albert\"" which was not only a skimpy portion, but so tough he could hardly cut through it. My mother in law had the fish and chips, which she said she wouldn't ever order again.\nMy advice-go for a cocktail, but go elsewhere for dinner!"
0,"I was studying for finals and so driving back and forth to campus a lot.  All of a sudden one evening my car's coolant light went on.  I take care of my car and so was concerned about the light.  I took it into Purcells where they proceeded to tell me that my car might overheat and explode if I continued to drive it, thus making me their captive.  I called my fiancee and told him the deal.  A couple hours later Purcells contacted me and said the engine needed repair and would cost around $900.  I asked if there were any sort of discounts and they said no.  Then when my fiancee went in they magically made it only cost $700.  I still don't think anything was wrong with my engine after all is said and done, but just paid them and went on my way, vowing to never come back."

1,"Place is the hometown brewery, excellent staff.\nFate's brewers show tremendous creativity and willingness to take risk as demonstrated by the breadth and depth of beers brewed. The folks behind the bar are enthusiastic and knowledgeable about their product. They are always willing to let the timid or curious try a taste of something new and different!\nI learned to enjoy a good sour here. It's an entire range of beers I'd never liked before.\nFate collaborates with other breweries to make some very tasty beers. Right now on tap are the 1055/Fate Into the Wind Sour Stout, and the Dragoon/Fate Infringement Pils with its 4 pounds of habanero chiles. And they're both well worth trying.\nThe food is simple - only what can be done in a brick oven or cold. So it's pizzas (all good, very thin crispy crust) or simple sandwiches. Not on the current menu, but available if you ask, is the Molto Carne pizza, which is the carne plus kalamata olives. They make their own chile infused olive oil as a garnishment for the pizza or sandwich.\nBest deal is the Friday lunch special - small pizza and a salad for $10. Their salads are well done, not simple, I get the Fate salad with the spicy nuts and the Molto Carne.\nI highly recommend Fate Brewing Company!"
1,I have been a resident for 1 year and absolutely love this place! The staff is courteous  and prompt with requests. I chose an upgrade 2 bedroom and it is beautiful! As far as the scorpion comments I have seen 2 in the year I have been here. I had a home and no different since we are located in the desert.
1,"Lots of famous people have eaten here and there's thank you notes written all over the white patched walls to prove it, along with hand written menus on the walls.  \n\nI came here after watching The Best I Ever Ate on the food network.  So maybe my expectations were too high because I don't think it was the best fried chicken I've ever had.  Don't get me wrong, it was good but I hate to admit that I've had better.  I would say this fried chicken ranks in my top 5 for fried chicken.\n\nThe staff is friendly and the lemonade is good.  Definitely give this place a try."
0,"Just ate there last night and left extremely disappointed.  While the steaks were good, I found the appetizers and side dishes way off base and very salty.  The Brussel sprouts with prosciutto side dish was so salty they did not charge me for the dish.  The same can be said for the potato & parmigiano zeppole. So for me, any steak house can cook prime steaks - it's all about the accompany dishes that allows one restaurant to outshine others. Unfortunately, Carnevino falls short from my experience."

Upon return, toilet not remedied. Called front desk and instead of fixing issue threatened to be thrown out of hotel. By far, worst hotel experience of all time."
1,"The family and I checked this place out for breakfast this morning. Apparently breakfast is a new offering so I'm guessing there's some kinks to be ironed out (ie the printing of menus). Regardless the food was good enough to get us to want to come back. But what's more enticing is their shake and malt menu inspired by the stars of the 50's and 60's. I had to restrain myself from ordering ice cream at 10am. \n\nAs for the customer service, it was a little to get going as there was no one to actually greet you when you walked in. BUT once we were acknowledged (say 30 seconds after arrival) the service was great. They brought us water, took our order, got us coffee and even entertained my munchkin with a play shopping cart with groceries all extremely timely!  The owner's personality is friendly and welcoming and you can tell she takes pride in her shop. It also felt like the wait time for food was short or perhaps it was because we spent our waiting time playing checkers and walking around the adorable vintage shop and nostalgic candy shoppe included. \n\nOverall this was a great experience and we will definitely be back. Must try the milkshakes. We are already penciling in our next stop to Bertie's of Arcadia!!"

1,"Beautiful hotel...well done up!\n\nThe entire interior of the casino and lobby floors define what modern should look like and it definitely has a lot of class to it. The staff at the tables are great, the drinks are well made (vodka tonic tasted much better than what Venetian gives...smoother vodka for sure), and the feel of the entire place is \""poppin.\""\n\nThe shops here are great. Can't remember their names for the life of me, but you can outfit a lost piece of luggage at one of these shops and still look good for an entire weekend here just by one stop. It's on the same level as Marquee. \n\nTime not permitting...sadly...my friends recommended the Bon Bar (not sure if that's how it's spelled, can't find it on Yelp). Very small corner bar next to the front entrance of the casino floor....looked incredible! Definitely hitting that up next time."
1,"Nestled along the myriad shops and restaurants on St. Denis, L'express is a wonderful French Bistro with terrific food and a bright lively atmosphere.  They have an extensive wine list and a compact but terrific assortment of classic French dishes.  Reservations are highly recommended, but the BF and I had no problem reserving a table the same day on the later side of dinner on a Friday night.\n\nWe both started with the green salad (which was fine), and ordered for our mains the beef tartare and the steak frites.  His tartare (which came with a mountain of fries and was ordered to be spicy) was very good; definitely a good move to get it spicy to bring out the dish's flavors.  My steak frites, however, were damn near perfect.  The meat was so juicy, flavorful, and tender, and when eaten with the herbed butter, forget it.  It was out of this world.  Dinner also included delicious crusty french bread, and the only cornichons I have ever eaten that I have truly liked (perhaps because they are served in a large mason jar which allows them to marinate in their own juices).\n\nWhile the service was a bit slow and the waiters seemed a little stand-offish, the food was definitely worth it.  I would definitely return the next time I'm in town and I highly recommend a visit for anyone in the neighborhood or passing through."
0,"At the time of this review no one can deny that the economy is down. People are losing their jobs. No jobs means penny pinching and that means no going out. I can not believe the poor service this 'establishment' offers to customers willing to pay for their overpriced drinks and food.\n\nService is HORRIBLE\n\nMy friend and I intended on going to the bar to get a drink then find a table and order some food. Many of you have done it before, go to the bar, get your drink on, go find some place to lounge. \n\nWE WERE DENIED SERVICE because we weren't playing the video slot machines. We sat for 20 minutes getting stupid looks from the bartenders and rude remarks.\n\nWe put money into the machines and were later told that it's not enough to rate service. There's no sign that says there is a minimum amount to be spent to quality as 'playing'. What if that's just my system? What if i put small amounts in at a time because that's my play style? I put a few bucks in and play a few hands and apparently because Jackson didn't go into the machine i'm not really 'playing'. BULL SHIT\n\nHow would you like to be corrected? A bartender walks by and rudely says 'cant sit there' or someone coming up and saying, excuse me fellas these seats are reserved for individuals who wish to use the gaming machines, i can get you a drink but we're going to have to relocate you elsewhere. \n\nI flagged down a bartender and three of them came up and said we were being rude. Seriously, is this how you treat PAYING customers? What kind of establishment treats their customers like shit? There are MUCH BETTER ways to address customers. \n\nIf it was one person behind the bar giving us a hard time because of a bad day i can understand that. NOT THE WHOLE STAFF. \n\nAnother thing. The same individual that said the seats are reserved for game players WAS SITTING EATING HIS LUNCH AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BAR ON A MACHINE SOMEONE COULD HAVE BEEN PLAYING."
0,"This is NOT the old Battista's!!!   It is now owned by Cesar's.  I always looked forward to eating there when the NFR was in town.  Now it is overpriced pasta.  I could not get a pizza or any of the old good stuff.  :(     Vastly disappointed.    With out the \""shoved down your throat menu\"",  the place still has kept it's ambience, memorabilia and the elder accordion player.  Please change back to the old menu (even a trimmed down one, put back the pizza and appetizers) and you will be the old, familiar, cozy, eclectic and special \""hole in the wall\"" place people will come back to."
0,"I have heard about this place a lot and how great it is.  Unfortunately, not only my expectations weren't met, I would rather eat Mexican food at Chipotle than here.  :(\nThe people were Fake friendly, looking to say, get your food and get the \""\""\"" out of my face.  Food was mediocre, nothing to brag about. Since they cook everything right in front of you, so the cleanliness is a top priority. I wouldn't go again, not all it was raved about to be."
1,"This review is purely on the spa facilities, as I did a day pass and did not get a service.  Fully enjoyed the spa.  Great sauna, jacuzzi, cool mist shower and steam room.  There is a wet and dry lounging area.  They have teas, lemon water and snacks (pretzels and cheese crisps) along with fruit.\n\nThe grooming area leaves a little to be desired - not a lot of styling products and sparse brush selection. But overall a good experience.\n\nThe fee for one day is $28 and a 3 day pass is $75."
0,"NO CHICKEN PRODUCTS. Seriously, in this day and age?\n\nI drove by this place hundreds of times, thinking it sounded pretty cool, and the other day finally bit the bullet and went inside. Put bluntly, there just isn't much of a reason to go back. \n\nI had no problems with the service or the speed at which we got our food, so I can at least list that as a positive for this place. \n\nBut their menu lacks any real variety. Sadly, the place is essentially a poor man's In-N-Out Burger, and they share In-N-Out's biggest flaw - a lack of any chicken products. Not everyone likes burgers and hot dogs, and you sure as hell can't make a meal out of just fries. In their defense, the place also had a breakfast menu, but they weren't serving it all day so that sort of defeats the purpose. \n\nThe big gimmick behind this place is they like to put chili on everything.... but seriously, can you run a whole restaurant around this premise?\n\nDisappointingly, the shakes are standard fast food fare, themselves being similar to In-N-Out. If I go into a retro-style restaurant, I want a quality 50s diner-style malt, not the crap I can go down the street to McDonalds and get.\n\nIf this place would add chicken products to their menu they would score some major points in my book.... but I somehow doubt that will happen anytime soon."
1,"Jean Philippe Patisserie, you have stolen my heart.\n\nMy cousin was in town and was staying here at the Aria and with the baby in tow, Jean Philippe was the best bet for the three of us. In fact we liked it sooooooo much for breakfast that we came back for lunch.\n\nFor breakfast we split the smoked salmon bagel and a couple of sweet treats. Smoked salmon was UH-MAZING....thinking about it makes my mouth water now. We came back for lunch and I had gotten a turkey sandwich. Croissant was flakey on the outside but melt in your mouth goodness on the inside. I also got a pain au chocolat to go and a chocolate cupcake for the hubby. Food was really good and I thought the pricing was semi resonable for the sweets. The line looks long, but they have a system that works. \n\nThis place is definitely one of the cheaper finds that you will find in City Center. I will definitely be back if I'm there."
1,"I'm there right now.  This place has great food, fun staff and the owners are great!  I come here several times a week!   The lamb is great!"
1,"The food was amazing. Dropped in on my way through Madison because of other reviews. We both had bluebird sandwiches. The person I was with added Mushroom soup which smelled so good that I stole a taste....it tasted freshly made. \n\nThe downside to Crema is the atmosphere. IMO, it was sort of dumpy looking...it was clean, but the decor is not to the level of the food."
1,I'm new to vegas and was looking for an Indian restaurant.  The food was delicious and the service was great!   Bonus for the free mango lassi!  Huge selection of food.  Nice atmosphere and convenient location.
0,"Last night I invited a film buff friend to attend the \""The Big Something\"" film using a Living Social coupon.  The coupon was for two and a bottle of wine.  When I redeemed the coupon I was told it was not good for this \""special showing\"".   NO where did I see on their site this was a special showing.   When I brought this to the attention of the cashier she said,  she doesn't write the web info..     Since we had made the long drive to attend, we paid the $5.00 required and she gave us the bottle of wine and took the coupon.   \nNow, to the film.  Being both Az. natives we were eager to see a film made here.  Yes, there are many recognizable locations.   As for the film...I'd rename it \""The Big Nothing\"".\nI don't know if this is the usual quality of films shown, but expect it's because it was made locally.  When coming out, after the WAY too long film, the bar was busy and many of the cast members were shmoozing.  I would have liked to have heard some sort of brief synopsis after the film, on WHY it was made.   Any of the present \""actors\"" could have done this if the writer/director was not present.  Will I attend FilmBar again?  Only if this is the sole place showing a film I must see."
1,"My new study spot! I just moved out to summerlin and I was looking for a new place to study...I probably do an equal amount of studying and people watching! The staff here is friendly, the wifi is free, the drinks are good...what more is there to ask for??? :-)"
1,"Having grown up in the northeast I was constantly dragged antiquing as a child but (thank you Dad) that continues to this day. I love having the luxury of AC in AZ and all the antiques in one place makes for super convenient browsing. Always great variety, fun junk to look through and the occasional find! Some booths are more expensive than others and some stuff is over priced but that is common with antique malls and it is Scottsdale. Still miss those little New England junk shops and barns filled with treasures though."
0,"the worst waffle house i've ever been to.  the waitress picked butter up from the floor, put it on our table and didnt wash her hands.  there was a piece of hair in my food which really grossed me out.  the waitress was guzzling down some energy drink between customers which was also gross.  i ordered a vanilla coke & was instructed to mix it up because it probably wasn't good.  it was so gross the amount of syrup in the drink.  it was mostly vanilla with a little bit of coke flavor.  it was dirty and gross.  also wreaked havoc on my insides probably as a result of the cleanliness."
0,"The service absolutely horrible and we thought the food was below average. When we informed the server in regards to our experience, he made excuses. We arrived at 8, and no one took our order for 30 minutes, then we didnt get our food until 910. We wasted two hours at this restaurant. We will not return. I would much rather go to passage of india or guru palace in the east valley. The server actually brought an item that we requested when we were done with our meal, then he turned around and blamed me. Who brings an item at the end of the meal. Very embarrassing. It is a friday night and it was not that busy for a friday night so I don't understand why such bad service. The saddest thing was that the server said one of our items was given to another party because another server picked it up, but then the waiter never came to tell us excuse me sorry we made a mistake, I am taking care of it. Instead, he brought the item at the end when we were ready to leave. There was belly dancing, but we didn't enjoy it because the rest of our experience was below average. The server rarely came to check on us. This place has amazing decor and ambiance and its too bad it was ruined by the service and quality of food. They were also selling indian clothing at the entrance which looked really pretty. Its unfortunate it turned out to be a bad experience here. I usually login here to give excellent review, I believe this is my first absolutely horrific experience. Bland food, bad service, blaming the customer, not taking responsibility, this summarizes our night."
1,Good place because its easy to find a table here. I order rice and curry dishes which are good. My girlfriend orders thai dishes and likes them. She is thai and likes the place because it reminds her of her mom's cooking. The dishes are average priced and sometimes the lunch rush is crazy.
0,"I think it's hilarious that I check Yelp reviews before I chose a place to eat.....But, I didn't even think to check before I booked my recent flight to Vegas. I am not a picky traveler. But, I agree with the vast majority of review.  It was hard to sit through the short flight to Vegas and I had to argue that I could put my bag under the seat and not pay the extra fee for my carry on. Yes....you heard me. Extra fee to place your luggage in the overhead bin. Although, it looks cheap, unless you've got a short flight, short legs, and no luggage-It's not worth it."
1,"I really enjoyed this restaurant. I love it for the d\u00e9cor, the chef, the servers... It was my first time there and it was my friend Holly's birthday and we got to sit by the window next to their various containers of salt. I loved the chalkboards, the plants, the brick, the displays. I loved how unpretentious it looked.\n\nIt wasn't too loud of ambience, but didn't make you feel like talking would echo throughout and be embarassing. The food was suprising, and unexpectedly amazing and I will tell you why. \n\nMy friend Holly is a vegetarian, and the dish she chose was about Onions. All about onions, and in fact had not much more than onions. So when her plate arrived and it was onions done in about 12 different ways, we were kinda shocked. It was filling, and it was so different in experience. We also started off with a cheese tarte and almost fought for the crumbs. I had the chicken sous-vide and it was juicy, tender, and tasty. \n\nWe could have stopped there, but decided to revel in food, so we ordered dessert: a delicious dessert of the most memorable pistachio gelato, and mille feuille, we had ever had the chance to try. We also got a macaron, but we did only because we've never tried it before, and neither of us understand the craze for them.  \n\nAfterwards the chef came and introduced himself and ask about our meal. Our server and the chef were very courteous and pleasant.\n\nI'd come back here in a heartbeat."
0,"By the way, this restaurant is still open. Now it's called Field Kitchen, and if you liked the original Sweet Tomatoes concept, you are going to hate this. Gone is the \""all you can eat\"" concept. Now you go through the salad bar line, ONCE, they give you the dressing (you don't fill up yourself), and you get ONE bowl of soup. There's still all the bread you want but everything else is extra. They have added a beer/wine/specialty drink bar, lots of additional sides and the four special salads they used to have at the beginning of the salad bar has been replaced with several salads that are very expensive.\n\nWe were in the Tempe restaurant today at noon when it should have been packed. There were eight tables...my husband counted them and no one was going for all the specialty items which cost more. Also gone are the desserts...now they are extra. The only thing you can have your fill of is yogurt.\n\nWe went to this restaurant specifically today because I had an adjustment to my braces and the only thing I can comfortably eat is soup. I paid $10 for one bowl of soup.\n\nAt this rate, this place really will close and that will just be a darned shame."
1,I like it here.  It's a nice cosy bar with plenty of seating areas to choose from of which are mismatched with different fabrics.  \n\nIt's situated a street down from where i used to live (when I was 0-4yrs old - so can't remember much from these days).  \n\nit's colourful outside as well as inside too - so puts a nice vibe on the walk.  It's quite a walk down tho .. but it's worth it!
1,Great place for a great cause! Always have new and interesting items for super cheap! They even have deal days that certain items are discounted. I would say we go once a week just to check it out. I never find to many clothes options but for the rest of the house it's totally a great place!
1,"The name Pedro's always seems to come up when searching for good Mexican food in Phoenix, but I never quite made it there due to its proximity to where I live and work.  That changed the other night when my friend convinced me to go car shopping with her and we passed it while driving to the dealership.  After a long, frustrating process at the dealership (what car buying experience doesn't fit that category) we were hungry and her baby needed to eat so we wanted to go somewhere close by, so we thought we would give it a try!  \n\nIt was about 7:30 on a Monday night, and there were about 5 other tables of people that seemed to be regulars.  We weren't sure what to expect from the outside of the building, and its location, but inside was clean with some kitchy decor.  The menu was vast and had all my favorite dishes...it was so hard to choose!  Ultimately I got a combo plate that included a bean tostada, cheese enchilada and a shredded beef flauta with beans (I opted for no rice).\n\nThe chips that came out first were delicious, hot, crisp and lightly salted, they were some of the best I have had.  The chunky salsa was good, but a bit on the sweet side, but it was perfect once I mixed in some of the hot sauce.  I really liked how they have you little bowls for your salsa, plates and salsa just don't mix!\n\nThe food came out fast and was piping hot....I tested the beans, my benchmark for Mexican food, and they were delicious!  Creamy, salty and rich, they were really good beans!  The enchilada was good, but I did feel the sauce was a bit on the thin side.  The beef in the flauta was delicious, really flavorful, it didn't even need sauce!  My friend had a burrito that she also enjoyed.\n\nOur pit stop at Pedro's was made out of desperation, but we walked away happy and satisfied and considering a return trip.  When we paid the cashier told us that they had been there for 51 years, I hope I make it back before they are there another 51 years!"
0,This hotel doesnt have enough parking space for its guests. Worst place ever in Vegas.
1,Hands down my favorite PT's. All the stuff you love about PT's plus a great patio.
1,"Love that place, the hot chocolate and chausson aux pommes are amazing ! \nFor the Parisian that I am, it was as good as home, the decoration in extra !"
1,"While eating here, my friends claimed that this was the best In-N-Out they have ever had.  I thought it tasted almost the same as every other In-N-Out I have been to.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious and still highly recommended!  However, I have learned that everything tends to taste much better to people who have been consuming mass amounts of alcohol.\n\nFor out-of -towners unfamiliar with In-N-Out, it is a must try!  There menu is simple and excellent.  There are only a few things on the menu, but it is about as good as fast food gets.  They also have a secret menu where you can customize your meal a ton of different ways, but I would suggest that first timers stick to the basics.\n\nI got the #1 combo when I visited here.  It consisted of a Double-Double ( a burger with double meat and cheese), fries, and a fountain drink.  It was not as magical as my friends made it out to be, but it really hit the spot for me and was super tasty.\n\nI am always down for some In-N-Out, and this location did not disappoint!"
1,"Best kaiseki ever! If Michelin would rank them, it would be two stars. Everything was done perfectly and meticulously. No details were spared!"
0,"Maybe there was a reason why this place had an open table while others had a wait on a Sunday evening....\nWell, I was extremely excited to check this to have BBQ and their menu looked DE-Li-CIOUS.  Well, no matter how great their menu looked, they were out of half of the things on the menu!! What kind of place runs out of food?\nWanted to try the bone marrow, out.\nSome other pig parts were out too...\n\nHad the combo plate... not sure. No beef ribs, low on pork ribs... =( \nEnding up eating pork ribs-  which was dry\nTri-Tip which was ok.\nPulled Pork- it was decent. \nAll of them tasted a lot better with some Original BBQ sauce that's on the table. Maybe it's because they were all on the dry side or it tasted like the food was reheated in the microwave\n\nOn the flip side, the staff was really friendly and the bar was awesome. \nTried their Sangria in a carafe, perfect for 4 wine glasses"
0,"For being in Vegas, the people working at this place are major buzzkills!  \n\nFlying out here we packed up our luggage nice and tight.  Clothes and toiletries in one checked bag and booze in the other... don't judge me, it's VEGAS!  So, we're heading back to Orlando and the woman asks me if I had anything fragile inside my luggage and I said yes, glass.  She goes on to ask if I had alcohol and me, being the honest (and half drunk) person I am, say yes.  She halfway scowls and gripes about needing a certain pouch to put the bottles in, not ladylike or nice at all!  I was fine to go ahead and pay to get said pouches, but when she unzips and finds an open bottle nestled tight in a towel she says this terrible phrase, \""you have to get rid of this.\""  WHAT?!  It was awful and my friend flying with would not have it and started offering free shots for everyone!  \n\nReading over this I see the problem... haha.  So glad TSA let us through the gates and we made it on home.\n\nIt's also a quite dated airport with few options for food and bev while waiting around, just sayin."
1,"A strong 4 stars and I'm going to agree with Misti Y on this one. They get a bonus star for devotion (and creativity in my world). The food experience overall is satisfying with delicious waffles and a filling smoothie. I dug into the breakfast sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed myself. However, as Misti also mentioned the price seems a bit high for what you are getting. Also, I dunno about you but I usually don't eat potato chips with a breakfast sandwich. They should add hash browns or even tater tots (haven't had those in forever) to their menu as a side item.\n\nCute, fun place that I will most likely return to on my next waffle craving."
1,I have always enjoyed taking my kids here for a quick bite to eat.  Service is always reliable and most who work here seem friendly.  The burgers are above average and the fries are great.  You cannot go wrong with the custard afterwards...it's just amazing.
1,"Here at DRC Powersports we recently crashed a vintage Vespa scooter and Steven from Dent Master Auto Body and Paint fixed it right up for us. Looks brand new and better than ever, also Steven did and amazing paint job on my own personal jeep... Two Thumbs Up for Dent Master and Steven!!!"
1,Delicious subs and friendly service!
1,"This place is awesome. They probably have the best nachos I've ever had...! If you come here, I highly recommend the street tacos menu. You can get three different ones for about $12. The tamales are also great but for best value, opt for the half dozen or a dozen and take some home!\n\nOur server was super friendly and helpful. I really wish this place was closer to town. It's probably a contender for being the the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas in my opinion."
1,Pho Van has been my go to for pho over the past year.  Always solid. The spring rolls are fresh and i usually go pho tai or just veggie. You won't be disappointed :)
1,"Had brunch with a friend Sunday (her first time) and as always, you can never go wrong with the pastry basket.  My personal favorite is the goat cheese and guava turnover fresh out of the oven!  We had the breakfast sandwich and vegetable omelet with pomegranate iced tea which were all wonderful.  The place was packed and we just wish we saved room for their infamous carrot cake!  Next time!"
1,"We were pleasantly surprised with this local find. They offered creative menu choices and the food measured up to our expectations. So did the drinks. Stephani, our wait staff, was very attentive. We were very happy with the ambiance, the food, and the drinks! Thanks for making our first night in Vegas fabulous!"
0,"Golden Spoon has an amazing product. It's truly the ice cream lover's froyo. The yogurt is creamy, flavorful and relatively nutritious. The staff are also consistently friendly and helpful. \n\nWhy the one star rating?  On a mission to satiate my cinnamon yogurt craving last weekend, I stopped by the Shea location. Some yogurt melted on my fingers while sampling--no biggie, I'd just run to the restroom. \n\nWhile drying my hands, I glimpsed some movement out of the corner of my eye, so I took a closer look.  I'd like to refrain from naming the baby bugs I saw darting around; I think we all know what bug is associated with perpetual infestation.  No, I'm not referring to termites or ants. \n\nHeart rate elevated, I took a brisk walk out to the front of the store. Passing the garbage can, directly adjacent to the yogurt machines, I spotted the one of the adult culprit(s), just chilling out and enjoying life. \n\nI absorbed my surroundings:  the yogurt machines were covered in what looked like several days' worth of melted froyo, the floor was in dire need of a proper cleaning and the front doors were propped open. There's nothing like the smell of delicious, sugary froyo wafting out the door to invite some more \""friends\"" into the place. \n\nI immediately emailed the owner of this location but I have yet to hear from him/her. I can't believe I actually went though with that purchase. My stomach lurches every time I think about having a taste. \n\nAfter this experience I will never go back. Ever."
1,"In a land of greasy beefy burgers, oversized dry buns, useless and tasteless accoutrements and massive salty and greasy fries, thank God for the Cowbell Burger and Bar.  My faith has been restored in the burger.  Thank you for the taste explosion and the pleasant feeling after dining experience.  The staff were attentive (not tooooo attentive), greeted quickly, served quickly. All in all a 5 star affair which I NEVER ever give."
0,"Visiting Phoenix and our friends who live in town often go there.  It was super busy and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table on a Thursday night, chips were greasy, in fact all the food was extra oily, flavors ordinary, services extra spotty as our very polite very overwhelmed waiter (with only 2 days experience) struggled to bring out food that took a long time to come and in fact one of us had not received her food and 3 of us were done.  I don't think they'll be back soon and we won't ask to go there....to bad, we were in the \""Clinton Ate Here Room\"""
0,Fish tacos wrapped in flour tortilla and sauce were terrible.   The volume on the TV was obnoxiously too loud.  There were 8 of us and you could only hear the person next to you.  Price for a pitcher of beer was reasonable.
1,"Came here with the family after the UFC fight on a Saturday night late (!!), luckily this was the type of place bypasses by most of the UFC crowd.  Somewhat randomly chosen but a nice find: sticks right out into the center of the MGM so you feel the open space.  The menu was a mix of comfort food and creative experiments: fun for the foodie and the grubby eater.  I was drawn to the most unusual combination of the burger with peanut butter, bacon jam, and potato chips, which proved to be less obnoxious than it sounds--the taste combo was fairly subtle and unified without too much of the extra ingredients and a nice crunchy, toasty, burnt taste that wasn't too overwhelming.   Great service (except forgetting one person's dish entirely---but then we got it fast and for free)."
0,"The punchline unfortunately has to be \""shockingly disappointing food\"".\n\nWe walked in without reservation and had a short wait of 25 minutes.\n\nWe began with Nam Kao Tod (crispy rice). The dish was not to my taste, as the sourness of the lime was too overpowering.\n\nNext we had the Tom Kah Kai. This mushroom soup with a coconut milk based broth proved inedible despite our best efforts and was unquestionably the lowlight.\n\nWe ordered drunken noodles with soft shell crab as our first entree. The noodles were passable but soggy, the crab meat was chewy.\n\nOur final selection, the musaman curry with tofu was mediocre, but the highlight nonetheless. It also had an unusual but pleasant sweetness.\n\nThough the food was a disappointment, staff was prompt, friendly, and attentive with wait staff checking in frequently (though not too often).\n\nThe price was also very reasonable for Las Vegas.\n\nOverall, I would recommend dining elsewhere."
0,"I was so disappointed this trip to Las Vegas by the Wynn Buffet.  I've been here a few times before and liked it so much I was willing to wait the hour or so in line to get into the buffet, but this time the food wasn't great at all.  Almost everything had an unfresh or chemical flavor,  I pushed most of the stuff around on my plate without eating it.  I went back to the buffet twice hoping I had just picked the wrong stuff the first time but nearly everything was inedible or less than stellar.  Maybe the Wynn has been cutting back with the economy?"
0,"First, I didn't realize that the location was so far from our house. It was listed as a \""deal nearby\"" even though it was over 25 minutes away. I am a huge fan of Kogi in California. I had the pleasure of eating Kogi at Coachella last year.\n\nSo, I was thrilled that a Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant was here in Vegas. So, after driving forever, we arrived. The first thing I was greeted with was \""we are closed and we didn't lock the doors. But if you order now, you can take it to go.\"" Thanks to everyone's reviews I knew what to order.\n\nThe bulgogi quesadilla was very greasy. The fried kimchee had a layer of grease floating on it. The meat didn't have the marinated flavor everyone talked about. The bulgogi burrito had a lot of rice and beans, lots of filler. The highlight was the spam musubi. The spam was fried and crispy. \n\nSo my experience could be just bad because we got there at closing. I would have rather left than paid for ok food and received the impression I was inconveniencing the owners."
1,"Love it. I drove past it a thousand times before I realized it was there - it's TINY! Clearly, being uptown, there's nowhere to park. If you're lucky enough to grab a parallel spot then YAY. If not, you gotta get dodgy. But it's so worth it. Authentic, delicious greek food. I've been eating gyros since I was 5 and my dad tricked me into eating one - saying it was \""juicy meat\"" not lamb. I pride myself on knowing a good juicy meat gyro and ooh buddy, THIS is a good gyro. Besides the gyro, the rest of the menu is phenomenal. Heavenly Baklava, delicious sandwiches and oh, did I mention the best Gyro in Charlotte? The staff is always cute and friendly, and the little outdoor tables are perfect for grabbing a quick lunch and being on your way."
1,So we found this spot by the house. Came first for dine in. Small restaurant but that is why we like it. I dislike crowded restaurants.  I like to be able to enjoy my meal. \n\nLooks like a lot of the business is take out too. We have now ordered here twice in the last week.  Still miss my Chinese food style from Hawaii but these guys are good!  This has become my go to place.
1,Went there to get a latte last night and was given a free Belgian waffle with gelato by one of their staff! Definitely the best waffle I've ever had. I will definitely be going back!
0,"Terrible service and the custard was very runny. We got a concrete with Reese's peanut cup. You could hardly see any Reese's peanut cup. Instead of fixing the concrete they gave us a tiny bowl of candy and told us to mix it ourselves. Oh and let's not forget the concrete is in a cheap \""red solo cup\"" from costco."
0,They still have a lot to sort out here. I understand its a brasserie and not fine dining but it could and should be better. The  Burrata was decent but not as creamy as other places. The French onion soup has a lot of beef and almost no onion or cheese. Saffron linguini was barely edible- way too spivey and barely any sea food. The side of mushrooms was way too sour but they were kind enough to take that off the bill. \nThe molten chocolate cake was really good. Sage is a better bet or maybe we should have just got a burger.
1,"If, when, how, the, what the! \n\nWho the heck. (Dramatic pause) \n\nCame up with this flavor driven tastebud amusement park for My belly!!!! \n\nAny way you try it. Any thing you place on it.  Your not going to regret it. Well if you eat too many in one sitting you might .,, uh yea just trust me on that. \n\nGreat service. Friendly staff. Always smiling and working hard. They love to help you with fun pairings and recommendations! \n\nThey have all kinds of dogs. \n\n(In slow mo) \nthey have Chicken dogs, Beef dogs, Pork dogs, Veggie dogs, Shriners dogs, boiled shrimp wait not that last one..    \nThey use Naan bread instead of buns (freakn amazing). Picasso had a brush they got NAAN!!! \n\nI've tried them all. Loved them all and lived to share my love with the world through means of verbal and social communication. \n\nHow dare you not go here... You should be ashamed... Bad doggie! \n\nAnd I'm out!!!"
1,"Bought a groupon for two drinks for $21. Staff was great and line was pretty short! We were offered free samples and both got the peach daiquiris with three extra shots each which was only $4 extra dollars! The drinks were very yummy and tasted more fresh than other frozen drinks on the strip! We did not finish our drinks though. It was 108 degrees and we walked two miles with them and they got warm and too sugary. I had plan people walking by comment on my large pink cup and saying how yummy it looked! I would recommend getting the beer bottle shaped cup though, it is a bit smaller but has a lid and handle!!"
0,"Service in my case was prompt, food on the other hand EH!\nA friend and I had lunch here, she had the so called Philly Cheesesteak umm no white American cheese which is what goes on a true traditional philly, not that Gawd awful cheese whiz crap, and it was served on a Cibatta Bun! WTF! \nIt tasted ok with Provelone but far from traditional!\nShe ordered O Rings which were onion straws, WTF, they tasted ok but huh?\nMy Seafood Chowder was a JOKE, frozen reheated crap! Nasty! My salad looked like it was made 4 days ago! \nThe Blue Cheese Dressing was the only saving grace!\nColor me Unimpressed!"
0,"03/08/2014 @ 09:08am\n\nI just went through the drive-thru. I ordered a breakfast combo. Very slow service, after I paid , still very slim. I saw the cashier handle my food, I could see her fingers touch inside the little pouch for the potatoes. I did not see her fingers actually touch the food, but the surfaces that would my food would likely touch once the bag shifts. Next she went into the corner, coughed into her hand. This was no just a slight cough, it was a muilti-cough type of cough. She then wiped her hand on her chest, went back to my food and bagged it up. Again picking up my potato bag while touching inside the potato bag.\n\nWhat happened to washing your hands?\n\nI confronted her about it, and she started to be a bit rude, but I think she realized her mistake and changed her attitude quickly.\n\nI can not afford to lose work and get sick because employees don't want to wash their hands.  \n\nI got my refund and left hungry."
1,"Good alternative if the food court inside Fashion Show is unappealing. Patio seating. Burgers are around $10 and there are both beef and chicken selections. Also salads. \n\nGoing to opt out of the fried pickles next time. Batter was too thick, so I had to peel off one side of batter..essentially I was eating an open-faced fried pickle. \n\nThe grilled cheese sandwich was good, came on thick toast with oozing cheese. I liked the jalapeno poppper burger. It isn't as heavy as it might sound with its fried cheddar cheese, date glazed bacon and jalapeno. Then again, I only took a bite.  \n\nI would come back because sometimes you just don't want fast food or a fancy meal...you want something in between..ya know?"
0,"This was the worst casino we visited while in Vegas. The low ceilings, the large crowds and the lack of intelligent navigational signs (which seem to not be a problem at any other casino) made me want to get out of here...and fast. \n\nI would never return to this casino and since you can't stay in a hotel in Vegas without being subjected to their casino, I would never book a room here either. \n\nOne word: Gross."
0,"Should change name to \""Ah Ful.\"" Seriously, the worst food I've ever had in Las Vegas...and I've been to Vegas, A LOT. \n\nWannabe PF Chang decor, horrible service. The food tasted and smelled so bad. It smelled like rotten fish. Our entire party of five honestly had to laugh at it - it was THAT bad. I will NEVER go here again. They have 1.5 star ranking on Yelp - how on earth are they still in business???"
0,"Any money you save buying from them is quickly eaten up, and then some, by extremely slow processing and poor product quality. I ordered 10 adult CPR manikins and 10 infant CPR manikins and 5 AED trainers. My order came in in two parts (AED trainers first, then manikins) several weeks apart despite all communication saying my order was shipped together with the first shipment. I had to call to find out that my other items were actually out of stock and were still at the supplier's warehouse and would be a week or more until it ships. The AED's all had batteries leaking and rusty when they arrived and I returned half of the manikins because they looked like they had been used in a preschool- most of the fingers had been chewed up. \n\nReturns ARE terrible and expect to be screwed if you need to do it. I followed all of the return instructions to the letter (including the requirement to have the return items tracked and insured to the tune of $85 from Seattle). They say it takes 2-3 days to process the refund AFTER they receive the items, so I call more than 10 days after I know they received it and, even though they see they have gotten the product back, they refuse to refund me the money for at least another 5 days- two weeks after they received the items. So of the $725 in returned product and $85 shipping, the two week interest-free loan, and a 20% restocking fee of $145, I was only refunded $545 of the $800+ I originally spent.\n\nIf you can afford to lose 30% or more of the original purchase cost AND giving out interest-free loans you'd probably be better off doing micro-loans to 3rd world farmers or hell, just giving it to a homeless person. At least then you know your wasted time and money did some good in the world."
0,"Dagda, I really wish I liked you more.  It's honestly not you, it's me.\n\nI really wish I could like Dagda more, it has so much that I usually love.  Great ale at the bar.  A pretty decent selection of wine for a dive bar/student place.  Cool interior.  Good prices.  A great selection of whiskey.  But every time I go in it's jammed packed with people, so many people you can't move no matter what time of night it is.  And it's sticky hot, probably because of all the people.  And it smells.  And it's just.... it just never seems worth it to push through all the people for a drink.  The staff are friendly enough (they never have much to say but all you should really be looking for in a place like Dagda is a drink suggestion anyway, in my opinion).  I enjoy other pubs more that carry the same sort of stuff.  \n\nSo yeah, I really honestly wished I enjoyed Dagda more, but I don't.  It's not unique to me, just smelly and cramped.  I just... don't get it.  Like Joe A. said, it just doesn't work for me"
1,"The hotel is perfectly located at one end of the downtown strip, you really cant get lost :), the room was nice and a guard didnt let you on the elevator unless you had a room key :) there is a hash house a go go located inside, you cant beat that !"
1,This was a good experience.
1,I literally squealed with delight when I found out P. Willys was open on my birthday. Got the Mailman Rick sandwich and started questioning why we don't eat here every meal. And now they serve breakfast! Holy shit! Complete with a birthday song from Randy! I love it!
1,"We weren't hungry enough for a full meal and needed a break from our beer drinking. The place is small and dimly lit, and brings to mind having drinks in a winer cellar, so the ambiance is appropriate. We had a reservation for dinner on a Friday night, but didn't really need one. The place wasn't full, but wasn't too empty either.\n\nWe had the bacon and cheese gougeres, the lamb with onion puree ( amazing- it's was braised, shredded and inside a crispy spring roll wrapper) the duck ( perfectly cooked) and the cod fritters (their delicious and delicate take on fish and chips). \n\nWe split a bottle of red recommended by our waitress who was educated in her wines. In all a great night out."
1,"I love this place for their delicious Dynamite Sushi... for their Wonton Soup (no pork)... walnut shrimp and honey chicken...\nThe place is cozy, and they just expanded the space... and then, the best thing is you can get a beer for 1 CENT, on Friday & Saturday night... ;o)"
0,"As I sit here on Saturday night at 8 pm, 35 minutes after being seated I still have not received my drink. Obviously the food hasn't arrived..."
1,"I have been playing at all the indoor facilities in town for the past 7 years and this one is by far the best, it most certainly is the cleanest. I play in the adult leagues and I have a son that is in the Lil kickers program. The staff is friendly and very accommodating although sometimes a little too laid back. The refs however are not too consistent.\nIt does get a bit hot in the summer months, but still a whole lot better than being outdoors in 110 degrees.\n\nLast week the owner was at the snack bar and my son had grabbed an ice cream and some chips, I realized I did not have my wallet with me and proceeded to tell my son to put the snacks back, the owner having heard that and seeing the disappointment in my sons faces said not to worry about it, its on the house. Now, you don't see that much anymore these days!"
1,"Been here a few times for drinks, LOVE IT! So fun, always a loud and happy place to hang out. Fun for a big group of friends or just good for a date night.\n\nCame out for dinner with the bf and Gabriela was our server. Was funny, attentive and got our orders right and was GREAT at refilling our mugs. \n\nI dig this place. Highly suggest the chicken sandwich it is HUGE."
1,"From here on out this will be my go to spot when i get my Mexican cravings! Lovely atmosphere both indoors and out on the patio. The prices are for sure unbeatable and the quality of food is excellent. I'm talking plates (big plates) starting at 9 bucks. Service was good and they are very accommodating to make your order just the way you want it. Whole list of exotic margaritas also...and i love free shit (especially if its food)so you know the chips and salsa that came out when we sat down put a big smile on this girls face.\n\nGood for family, date night, gossip time with the girls etc..\n\nmuy delicioso !"
0,"Food is average ,delivery and time scheduling very very terrible ... Schedule time and had too wait an hour after schedule d time will not order from again."
1,"I love the fish tacos from here, I've tried a few different ones and they're always great. There's a ton of fish in the tortilla every time too !"
0,"If you like spending like a high roller- this place is for you. They charge for everything- wi-fi, tube for lazy river, fridge, etc. $14 drinks at the pool. No umbrellas or tables at the pool cause they want you to rent a $200 cabana. The pool complex is great but closes at 6pm. No in-room coffee maker. Had to go across the street and buy vodka to sneak into the pool like the college kids were doing. Servers and concierge staff were surly and dismissive. \n\nIn other words, with the facilities, this resort would have been fantastic with better customer service.\n\nYou could probably say the above about all the hotels on the strip so it has totally lost its allure for anyone who takes pride in being frugal."
1,Was visiting Arizona and stopped by the mall and enjoyed some yogurt.  Fresh fruits and good selection of frozen yogurts.
1,"Great drinks with a great atmosphere!\nI had the mango black tea with lychee jelly, the peach black tea again with lychee jelly, and the japanese green tea smoothie with boba.\nThe teas were all delicious and refreshing, and the lychee jelly popped with sweetness in your mouth (that's what she said) and tasted a bit like honey.\nThe japanese green tea had notes of thai tea to it which I loved.\nI originally forgot my wallet too and had run back to my dorm room to get it, but they still smiled and said \""that's fine, it happens\"" and had my tea's ready for me as I walked in the door.\nThere are students here on their laptops doing homework. The decor reminds me of a forest in October with fall colors and some wooden tables and orange couches. \nThe woman next to me spoke to me and she's driking a green apple slushie that looks delicious. I'll definitely have to try it next time!"
1,"I'm visiting friends in the small city of Buckeye, AZ.   I say small because it felt really small, like not a lot of people.   Turns out it was really small in 2000 with just over 6500 people, however it's been growing by leaps and bounds since then!    When the 2010 census rolled around, Buckeye's population had EXPLODED to more than 50,000!   That's an increase of 673% in 10 years, WOW!    I guess it's not that \""small\"" after all, because Buckeye is spread out over 392 SQUARE MILES!!\n\nOh that's right... I'm reviewing a grocery store here not giving a history lesson, so let's get back to that.    \n\nWe made a couple trips to this store, one of two grocery stores in town.    It was modern, clean, very well stocked and HUGE!    I wandered around exploring the store and was quite surprised by some of the things I found.\n\nThere is a very nice, well stocked produce department.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frys-food-stores-of-arizona-buckeye#BVyOWxHnFeSvJP44OJPdFw\n\nA nice deli counter/department too.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frys-food-stores-of-arizona-buckeye#xi2lI287wN4pJDV-j4r1xA\n\nVery clean and well stocked rows (& rows & rows) of merchandise.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frys-food-stores-of-arizona-buckeye#Mtg6BjcMTGuP5x4Tmxo9XQ\n\nWait, they sell furniture too??\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frys-food-stores-of-arizona-buckeye#SPf85X2vfKEstGpJtUO49Q\n\nBBQ's & patio furniture!   Wait, did I walk into a Home Depot by mistake?\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frys-food-stores-of-arizona-buckeye#NLuWpPJVznUc95NDo82wNw\n\nTV's!?!?!?\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frys-food-stores-of-arizona-buckeye#4vU5hdEASdfZxxKwlm6gDQ\n\nOK people this is a first for me... I have NEVER seen linens being sold in a grocery store!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frys-food-stores-of-arizona-buckeye#H2-2XFhw4wBlzhl4W0yAPQ\n\nThey even have a gas station outside too!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frys-food-stores-of-arizona-buckeye#yHl_tr6OUAkC1uRySjMOSA\n\nThere is also a bank, a bakery, a post office, a garden center, a full-on pharmacy and even a medical clinic in this store!!    Boy-o-boy this is quite the grocery store... and talk about one-stop-shopping!!    Fry's Marketplace has hit that nail directly on the head on that point, WOW!"
0,"This Ulta is close to my house and I waited way too long to order my makeup online and wait for snail mail arrival. Decided to go in here today knowing they have the Smashbox products I needed. I wanted to try something different and was excited to try some new makeup. Always love when they help you out. Well the store was somewhat busy, it is the weekend, and they only had 2 women working in cosmetics. One of them was nice enough to notice me and tell me she was working with someone. So I stood and sat around for a good 10 minutes while the other girl helped 3 other people who were there after me. I even asked if there was anyone else who could help. I mean come on, just because I'm not an aggressive older Biltmore snob doesn't mean I don't need help. I went as far as complaining to the manager and she offered me a free gift! Not help with what I wanted, not a good time to come back but a free gift.\n \nNeedless to say I'll be taking my money to another store. Probably the last time I'll shop  here."
0,"I honestly do not know why this place has the rating it does.\n\nThe wife and I went to the other location first, as she wanted to try the tuna melt.\n\nAfter waiting in line, my wife ordered the tuna melt. The cashier then informed us (with a bit of attitude) that they don't have the tuna melt.\n\nWe then drove to this location, as we were heading to that part of town anyways.\n\nThey have the tuna melt.\n\nMy wife ordered it with onion rings (which they did not give us, they rang it up for fries instead....\n\nAfter waiting fairly long, we finally got out food, sans the onion rings. Since the place was so slow on getting the food out, we just let it go.\n\nThe burger was boring, nothing special. Same with the fries as well. Honestly, In and Out is the same money, and tastes much better. There honestly was nothing flavorwise that stood out our entire meal. It is just another boring burger joint trying to cash in on nostalgia.\n\nThe reason I am only giving them two stars? The place was NASTY dirty. I nearly slipped on some ketchup that was all over the floor in front of the register. The cashier seen this, and did nothing.\n\nThe area where the drink machine and condiments were - was disgusting. It looked like it had not been cleaned once that day. There was spilled ketchup, sticky drink residue, etc all over the area.\n\nThey had both areas opened up, and finding a clean table was a challenge. I do not think they had anyone that was cleaning tables. The floor was filthy as well. My wife said it was so bad, if they gave her a mop she would even be compelled to clean it.\n\nIf I had to use the restroom, I would have held it - because with as poor shape as the main areas were, I would hate to see the restrooms.\n\nIt was a good value, well priced - albeit nothing special. However the absolute lack of any effort in keeping the place clean will ensure we never return."
0,"Loved this location so much but the last three visits included a 10 minute wait in line and they still said, \""pull around and wait for the food\"" - way to pull best practices from all the other shitty fast food joints.\n\nAt least the guy was honest and said he gave our food to the car ahead of us and needed to recook everything. \n\nAdvice: go to another location!!!"
0,"I saw this place leaving Safeway and wanted mexican food, I checked my  yelp mobile app. and got really excited when I saw the reviews. I bought a few different burritos and brought them back to work. Bean burrito pretty good. I was really excited about the carne asada burrito, the meat was tough a dry no one actualy actually ate more than two bites. I am a mexican food snob but, no one was really a fan. \n\nIt was a tough call between two and three stars but, after the carne asada I just couldn't give it the third."
0,"The service here is terrible. I hate how people can smoke here (doesn't make sense to have physical activities and smokers in the same spot). My mother had her 50th birthday party here. I had a lot of fun playing the bean bag toss, horse shoes, ping pong, and sand volleyball. On a November night, it is freezing! The band was terrible and could only play 1 genre- undanceable rock music. Plus there were like these floozy 40 year olds trying to dance sexy and it just made the place look trashy. So a waitress takes orders on our food and she brought it out 30 minutes later and still uncooked. She only brought out the chicken tacos cooked. I would have cooked my food sooner had I known that she was just bringing it out and going to take half an hour. Never came to check out on us and didn't really let us know what we could order. The bartender was great, but the service is not. The food is ok. NOT vegetarian friendly in terms of cooking your food on a meat cooked grill. They have a veggie burger and foil, but no veggie thongs to turn over the veggie burger and no clear definitions of what sauces have meat products in them. I'd never come back here unless my mom paid for me again."
0,"Came here with a pub crawl. They charged $20 for all you can drink. I paid $50. They insisted that I only gave $20. They said they had video proof, but would not show me. The end."
1,Went here for breakfast on the way out of town.  Very nice.  I had the biscuit and gravy which was very tasty.  The gravy actually had a sweetness to it.  Loves the potatoes and onions.  Good coffee.
0,"About as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate. Bland, plain and tasteless. The only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread. Avoid."
1,"I usually stay next door at the Aria. I tried Vdara vecause of a room rate deal. As far as the hotel goes, it is just fine. With no casino, it was a nice quiet refuge from the strip. BUT, LIKE EVERY STORY IN VEGAS, WITH THE GOOD, COMES THE BAD ....\n\nVdara is valet parking only. I can only presume that they have some crazy figure 8 Hot Wheels set up in the parking structure that precludes recreational drivers from parking their own cars.  \n\nOkay, so we roll with the valet. However, when my clean ride comes back, there's a new door ding. Ba-bam! I'm not a sniveler by any means, but they made me use the car jockey. It wasn't my choice. So, I make a claim. And, I have have to say I didn't have any expectations that Vdara (or big brother Aria) would accept responsibility for the damage.\n\nAnd, what do you know, I - was - right.  Here's my exchange with Aria Risk Management representative \""Al.\"" \n\nAl  \""I checked the video and see your car already had the damage.\"" \nMe \""Really?\""  \nAl  \""Yup.\""  \nMe  \""The ding is about 3/8 of an inch. How could you even see that?\""  \nAl  \""We have a hi-tech high resolution video system.\""  \nMe  \""I'm cool with that, just email me a copy of the photo image from your system.\""  Al  \""Oh, I can't do that. It's pr-o-p-r-i-e-t-a-r-y .... They would fire me on the spot.\""  \nMe  \""Dooh ... So, you can't send me a photo of my own car?\""  \nAl  \""No, you'll just have take my word on this.\""     \nMe (Words not for publication)            \n\nMy suggestion - If you wanna stay at the Vdara, park in the Aria garage and walk to Vdara. That way, if your car gets door dinged, you'll be upset, but there's no clear suspect to be pissed at.\n\nEPILOGUE - Well I'll be damned!  After I sent a letter, Aria/Vdara took a second look at my situation took care of my issue.  I won't disclose the details, but I'm presently in a renewed semi-happy place about Vdara.  With that, I'm adding back a couple of stars to the rating.  \n\nI've actually returned to Vdara many times all with positive experiences.  I really like this place. I continue to self-park at Aria and walk through to Vdara."
0,I bought a gift card for Groupon for this restaurant $15 what's the cost for $30 worth of food thought that was a great deal until after I finished the purchase and it said I could only use 10 dollars at a time it did not tell you this until after you confirm your purchase very dishonest when I asked the owner if I could use them. anyway that I was from out of town and would not be able to come back he said no so I got up and left I felt the server was very rude I tried to place an order several times she looked at me and walked away then when I asked to speak to the owner about the mishap with a certificate he didn't come until they put the food on the table. The food did look good and it was a good price but I was very unhappy with how they treated me.
0,The food was greasy. BBQ sauce wasn't good at all. I went to try out their restaurant because the food looked good on triple Ds. Turned out the food wasn't worth the drive
1,"great service, loved the sushi! best bang for buck Sushi ive been to in Montreal...thanks for the staff for being kind and explaining what the meal was...got the Tasting one..."
0,"As promised, I went back to try the food on this trip. Unfortunately, the burgers just didn't live up to the hype and didn't even touch the delicious burger at the Barrymore...not sure why as it is the same company. Anyway, I got the farm burger (or something...the one with the bacon and the egg). There is no reason this should not be delicious. Even when I make burgers at home with bacon and egg on them, they are delicious. This was not delicious. It was so bland and boring. I felt like I was eating a totally plain burger from like Red Robin or something. The BF got the burger sliders and said they were pretty meh. For a 30$ lunch, I would not recommend this place....definite pass....head over to the Barrymore instead."
0,"Won't be back ! Proud to say that I have probably been to every establishment in Boca Park over the last 5 years, so I figured it was about time to follow tradition and venture into Embers. Immediately upon arrival it seemed like my kind of joint, like the vibe and the decor. My friend and I decided this might be a good place to catch the UNLV game, so we took a seat at the bar. After about half a beer we struck up a very good conversation with two females seated beside us who were also lawyers, it definitely some of the best conversation I've struck up in a good while, however it would not last. It seemed as though the bartender took exception talking to these girls as evidenced by him continually jumping into our conversation with snide remarks, and was even brazen enough to ask us to give up our seats as move because he had some \""players\"" coming in. While we came in with the intention of watching a UNLV tournament game, we were quickly relocated to seats out of view of the TV. The humorous part was that these \""players\"" that forced us to move were an older couple, and only one of them ended up playing. Furthermore she played a measly $5 on the table game. I would have easily offered to double her earnings just to not have had to give up our seats, view of the game, and new found friendship. Really a move that soured my experience at Embers in Boca Park. Ended up walking across the street to Kona Grill where we found better service, accommodations and entertainment."
1,"You either \""get it\"" or you don't at marigolds. My mother, a visitor to our fair city, deemed marigolds to be too crowded at 1130 on a Sunday morning. She has never seen it at 930 on a Saturday morning. Once my parents initial shell shock of the hustle and bustle around us wore off, we were able to score some seats and wait for our breakfast.\n\nIf you know me, I am a Bloody Mary snob. That bing said, the bloody I had at marigolds was delicious. The mix and seasonings used in the mix were balanced well, and I could sense just the right amount of vodka without it being overpowering. \n\nBetween all of us that went out for my bday brunch, I must have tried just about everything. From the scones, to the daily scrambler, to the pancakes, to the French toast, to the quiche, to the breakfast Sammie that was on special that day, everything was great.\n\nMy qualm? The coffee. It was exceptionally bitter. And I am a lover of bitter and sour tasting things. Something was just...off. These things happen.\n\nWe got in, we got seated, we got served. Great bday brunch in an adorable, brightly lit restaurant."
0,"We used to love this place when it was Buon Gusto. It is our neighborhood bar/restaurant. The staff was amazing, along with great food.  The food is still great, however, when the \""new\"" owner took over in October of 2013 and fired all of the previous staff, the new staff is terrible.  We have been in 3 times since Picazzo's took over again...2 times we have encountered Josh in the bar area.  He seems to hate his job. Not sure where he came from, but he doesn't greet customers with a friendly vibe at all.  Both times with him serving, we sat with empty drinks for over 30 minutes. I practically had to beg him to even order a pizza.  Isn't that what customers come in to do?? Order food and drinks? We won't be coming in again, unfortunately, even though it is so convenient with great food."
1,"Best Pho I've found in Vegas so far!\n\nThe broth was superb, although their selection of Pho isn't as big as most other places. I usually get the Pho Dac Biet anywhere I go, I love the tendon and tripe but this place only had rare steak, brisket, and flank. They put a lot of meat in it too which was a + in my book, but the noodles and broth are what made it for me. \n\nEspecially being in Vegas, this might save  your life the morning after a long night. After leaving Pho Kim Long I felt like new, ready to take on whatever vegas had left to throw at me. I WILL be back to this place again, thats for sure."
0,"Quite frankly, I don't get the hype. None of the crusts are particularly good--the guys making them have no idea what they're doing. Crusts shouldn't be semi-soft (even if it's regular), and the thin crust is simply mediocre. \n\nAnd then there are the specialty ones. If you want something that's really vomit-inducing, go for the tailgate pizza. This is simply mediocre pizza at best--cheese and pepperoni can really only be compared to Dominos.\n\nI'm a \""Coastie\"" (I hate that term...), and we take pizza pretty seriously back East--I would also like to note that the pile of dough and glop you get in Chicago is not pizza. Justice Scalia certainly agrees with me on that note. Glass Nickel, though? Sigh. Sigh. Sigh."
0,"Stay away from this place. The GM is a complete dick. He kick me out because his buddies crashed out cabana we asked them to leave, they started to fight with us and we get kicked out. Screw this place and don't waste your money or your time at this place!!!!!!\n\nNeedless to say because of this we took our business elsewhere for a birthday party and had a better time."
0,"I am on the fence with this one.  While the atmosphere is relaxed and fun (who wouldn't like that retro gas station ambiance?) and the service was quick and friendly, the food is not enough to keep me coming back for more.\n\nThe outdoor seating is casual, with picnic benches and tables surrounding two 70's style gas pumps.  The setting offers a perfect view of the world going by on Cave Creek Road.  Dogs are welcome (yay!), and you will see plenty of furry friends enjoying the day.  The interior is small, but the space is used well with a few tables, and a small bar which also serves as the counter where orders are placed.  \n\nLooking forward to big juicy burgers, we chose:\nBig Earl Burger ($5.75)\nBleu Burger ($6.99)\nSide of Onion Rings ($3.75)\nVanilla Milkshake ($5.75)\n\nThe milkshake was by far the best item - thick and creamy.  However, at a price of $5.75 I was disappointed to see it came from a machine.  The burgers were OK - I enjoyed the ample bleu cheese on mine, but the beef patties were thinner than I expected.  The onion rings, while indeed greasy, were not the best I have tried.  That award hands-down goes to Rocket Burger.  \n\nOn this visit, we had a 20% off coupon.  The woman who took our order seemed a bit confused by the math, and we ended up only receiving a 10% discount.  Shame on me for not catching it earlier, as the line when we left was very long and I did not want to wait to request a correction.\n\nAll in all, Big Earl's is a good place to sit outside and enjoy the view.  Maybe with a beer or two but not for the food."
0,"I just moved into a new place, and Coronado Cafe is right around the corner. The menu looks great, the wine list is well-rounded, and the opportunity to stumble home after several glasses of vino gave this place major points before I'd stepped in the door. I WANTED to like it, but I'm not sure that I'll go back.\n\nMy fiancee and I were seated by a friendly hostess at a small table in a cozy room at the back of the restaurant (house). It had the opportunity to be intimate, but it was over-lit, and we felt awkward hearing every word of our neighbors' conversation. \n\nWe started with the Brie and Lavash, which was wonderful. All of the flavors melded together perfectly. Around the same time we ordered a bottle of wine. Our waiter poured us a glass, and that was the last time he touched our bottle for the rest of the night.\n\nFor entrees I got the penne pasta in a green chile cream sauce (rich and tasty--one of the few vegetarian entree options), and the fiancee went with the pork tenderloin (dry and chewy). The portion that he was served was the end of the tenderloin--a piece that rarely makes it onto the plate as an entree because it is notorious for being tough and dry. Our server never came back to check on our food, so we didn't have a chance to make it right. \n\nTo sum it up: a snotty, inattentive waiter and hit or miss food. It might be best to go for an appetizer and bottle of wine. Just be prepared to pour it yourself."
1,"I give pink box 4 stars, if I was just reviewing for toppings and creativity it would be a 5 all the way. But to me they just taste like standard donuts with fancy stuff on top. I know this isn't an easy way for someone to compare, but if you find yourself in oakland, go to donut savant. They not only have the creative donuts down, but even the dough is well above what a normal donut tastes like."
1,"Since it's already a well-established point that this place has delicious food at an excellent value, I'll simply provide a few bulleted remarks:\n\nGreat Original Paintings\nSweet & fresh faced Guadalajaran transplant at counter\nAmazing Strawberry Salsa (WTF -- who knew?) \nNew favorite pinto beans in town (sorry America's Taco Shop)\nNot a fan of the Dogshark taco\nChicken Mole & Conchinita were T'Asty\nGenerously portioned $6.99 2 taco combination entree is UNBEATABLE\n\nI went in at 1pm, and the place was empty.  With all these great Yelp reviews, where are all the sophisticated, bargain hunting peeps with a hankering for delicious Mexican in a town notoriously lacking in this?"
1,The outdoor patio is a slice of Heaven! Live Music on Friday nights. Complimentary Valet. The Menu is a bit of Healthy and Sinful which is \nperfect prices are great staff is friendly complimentary WIFI for people like me who work from a different coffee shop almost every day to keep it FUN.\nSimply Divine!!!!
1,best fried chicken in charlotte.
1,"Having lived in Thailand I feel that I know what authentic Thai is and what \""westernized\"" Thai is and this place stays true to Thai food. The Kaprow was just as good as I would get from the street vendors in front of my apartment as was the Som Tom. Will definitely be back to get my favorite dishes from back in Thailand. Bonus is that they have perfectly cooked sticky rice"
0,Staff were more concerned about carrying on their conversations than waiting on their customers.  The food was okay but the kitchen is very slow. Everyone here needs training an attitude adjustment and management. Too bad.
0,"This buffet is very fancy, but $32.99 plus tax is not worth paying for. The main dishes had no taste. I only enjoyed eating the deserts and fruits that they had available that day. The orange juice was also good. I would only recommend this buffet to people who careless about food taste. I was there only for breakfast, but since I didn't like it I did not go back for lunch. The lines were not that long. We waited about 10-15 minutes to get our seats."
1,"My favorite of all the Cirque shows on the strip! The spectacle of \""O\"" is amazing, but the storyline, music and automated stages are what makes this one the ultimate show to see in Las Vegas. Especially now that the original battle finale has been restored; this show shouldn't be missed!"
1,"Replaced my garage door at an extremely good price, great work courteous and timely. This is the place to call for all your garage door needs. We use them for both home and our commercial doors. Thank you so much!"
0,"Sorry to kill the buzz of these rave reviews.  I have actually had good experiences in the past with this store and agree with the previous posts but these guys have abandoned the good business savvy that they have had for the past few years.\n\nI called to get directions to the store and their own voicemail directs me to the store inside Bike Emporium at McDonald and Granite Reef.  I went there and was informed by 2 kids and a dog that they are \""in move right now\"" and there is no forwarding address.  They are currently and apparently considering 2 new locations and will \""be deciding which is best in about 2 weeks time\"".  Great business guys!  Lead me to your store where you're nowhere to be found, no update to your website nor voicemail and here's the best part. . . the owner leaves a cell phone number where when you call is nothing but a rambling voicemail with guess what:  directions to McDonald and Granite Reef inside Bike Emporium.  Unreal!  I left a message and haven't heard a thing back.  I probably wouldn't be so disappointed if I hadn't had good experiences in the past but come on. . update your information. .people actually read and follow it.  I can't say I can support a business who can't do everything to take care of their livelihood, their customers.  Try the Runner's Den or buy online-they'll be there when you arrive."

1,"I love the poker palace, last couple times we were in Vegas we drove up here for some 21. The dealers are super friendly and the drinks are cheap, this place is in no way scary! Will be moving to Las Vegas soon and plan on coming here regularly."
0,"This is a really poorly managed place with a lot of room for improvement. The facility is very nice, but unfortunately the staff and  services are not. Not only did Cindy cut me while age was cutting my cuticles- so deep that it didn't stop bleeding for 30mins, but I was up sold (forcefully, though I know I should be more firm with my 'no') to a gel polish manicure which chipped that very night. \n\nUpon going back they told me they blamed the problem on me & told me they would only fix it if I waited for 2 hours. When a very nice woman offered to wait for her appointment, they refused to let her delay her appointment & argued with her and I until we both left. \n\nWhat an expensive disappointment"
0,i would give this a 2 star.  the place is just disorganized.  lots of products and lots of different brands.  there is a huge parking in front. they close at 8 p.m.
1,"Wow, Im a sandwich, sub, & steak person and this place is incredibly delicious. This is my first time here. Staff very friendly & gave us a free mesquite fries to try, love the food. Felt very comfy & inside the place is well designed, cant wait to try eating outside. Will be a returning customer very satisfied."
0,"It took me a few years to open my eyes at how terrible this place is. \nIts always crowded! Even at non-peak times. \nThe staff there is the rudest and not the brightest. I once asked the muscle-y guy at the front desk how many laps on the track make a mile and he replied \""Oh around 8 or 10\"". Huh? Which is it? 8, 9 or 10? And sadly, I think he was a manager. \n\nCleanliness? I don't think so. As other people have mentioned, there's always a stink. Like a combo of dirty socks, sweat and I don't know what! Even worse is the playroom. It ALWAYS smells like dirty diapers! I'm ashamed that I actually left my kid here once. Also, I once got a towel that was completely stained with what looked like womens make-up. When I walked over and returned it to the front desk, did I get anything remotely similar to an apology? Nope. Nothing just silence. This has got to be the worst customer service ever!  \n\nFinally, one word - FEES! Though it sounds like a deal with a low monthly, there is a fee for everything. There's even a fee if you want to leave! \n\nOverall this place is just aggravating!"
1,Consistently great food from this gem in the south hills. Vibrant atmosphere. We have been here several times over the last two years and the food is always terrific. Try the beet salad and the grilled crab appetizer. Fantastic.
0,"My two children went to PCDS from Pre-K until 5th grade.  The campus is very pretty and they have state of the art facilities and the latest technology. That is the best part about the school.  Some of the teachers are great, others can be very cold.  It seems that every grade in the lower school has one strict teacher and one warm, kind teacher.  There are very high expectations of the children - sometimes forgetting that they are, in fact, children.  Over 50% of the parents in both of my kids classes were asked - from 2nd grade up to 5th grade - to have their children tested for ADHA or other learning disabilities for their attention span and lack of focus.  70 minute classes are difficult to focus and retain that much information for a 10 year old!  Lower school was a nice experience, but middle school was like an entirely different school.  The homework load is intense and time consuming leaving little time for extracurricular activities without adding stress.  In addition, playing an instrument is a requirement - not an elective - in middle school, which takes up even more time.  However, they stop teaching computers in middle school, which I found odd.  I know my kids will have a computer in their future...a clarinet, I'm not so sure.  The head of the middle school needs to take some computer classes, because he has been caught emailing parents, myself included, conversations with other staff about the students, or even about the parents themselves.  Then he will email the parents a chain of emails where the entire previous conversation he was having is attached.  When they ask you if you have any questions to contact them?  Yes, they will email each other about \""another one of THOSE parents\"" and be irritated with your \""dumb\"" questions or concerns.  This happened repeatedly, with multiple parents and is juvenile and shockingly unprofessional.  Then there was the teacher that would take points off your grade if you went to the bathroom during class and there was a child in 5th grade who wet his pants because of it.  There was the parent who was at a beginning of the school year meeting with all of the parent's and was asked, by the head of the middle school,  to stand up, in her work out clothing, as an example of what your child should NOT wear to school.  There are SO many stories from the parents and the students of the things that go on at this school, particularly in the middle school, with the principal of the middle school and almost all of the 5th grade teachers, except for one, that all of the students and teachers like.  In the end, you realize, your child is just a dollar sign.  There is little concern when a parent decides they won't be returning.  They just wish you luck and wipe down their desk for the next kid to take their place."
1,"A fantastic experience.\n\nI took my wife and adult daughter to Sushi Samba.  Things started off a bit dodgie when the ladies at the front screwed up, but everything worked out great.\nWe think the key to the great experience was our server, CARMINE.  Carmine asked us our price point, inquired as to our likes, dislikes and food allergies and proceeded to turn what could have been a bummer into a remarkable experience.\nGreat food, try the Yellow Tail Tacos, great service, thank-you Carmine and a very cool vibe.\nA fore sure come back."
1,One of the best brunches I have ever had.
0,Although we love staying here this review is specifically about the rude bitchy bartender at the bar behind the craps tables.  He gets one star for his snotty attitude and condescending treatment of the guests.  Not sure of his name but he is tallish with shaved head. You'll know who I'm talking about when he treats you like he doesn't work for tips.
1,"| Out-of-Towner Review |\nI visit family in Chandler each year for Christmas, but this was our first trip here. The food is excellent. The number 3 combo plate (chili con carne, tamale, taco, enchilada, rice, beans) solved my pregnant wife's crunchy|spicy|melty craving problem she's been having for a few weeks.\n\nThe red sauce here is to die for. (This is a New Mexico style place, so you get Hatch Valley chiles as your main pepper ingredient across the board.) It is very, very good and makes the combo plate one of the best things on the menu. You know it's good when the taco is the ranked last on the plate. (And the taco was very good.)\n\nLunch/dinner combos are served with chips to start (which come with four dips) and sopapillas for desert. Get the cinnamon and sugar ones - they're great.\n\nThis place does get busy, so you will wait during peak times."
0,"This place was not \""awesome.\"" The bread stuff were stale, veggies were bland, and meat were overcooked. Plus, they messed up on table d\u00e9cor that was particularly requested by my mom. Luckily, the two stars was for the service lady who stuck wit us for two hours.  Not comin here again though :("
0,What a waste of money! If you're looking for a lecture by a couple of sweaty libertarians you'll love Penn & Tellers tired old show. The magic is minimal and their big closer they've done on television dozens of times. The old bullet in the mouth bit. (The audience members aren't real audience members). \n\nThe real magic act is the fact that people keep coming to see their stale mediocre show!
0,"One and a half stars would probably be a better rating.... but I'm hard-pressed to argue for it being the worst.  And the casino itself is fairly friendly, if a little lacking in theme.\n\nAbout the best that can be said about IP is that it's right smack in the center of everything: between Harrahs and Flamingo, across the street from Caesar's Palace.  And that's, unfortunately, the beginning and end of the things that sell me on it.\n\nThe street face is under construction, so it's hard to mark it down for outside appearance.  That said, at $150/ night for a weekend in October, there is near-as-nothing to justify the cost.\n\nFor that price, my friends and I received a \""Deluxe\"" room.  A simple two-queen bed affair, with a small rounded card table in one corner and the bare basics: tv, dresser, bathroom.  They charged a fifty-dollar fee for having a third person in the room, but for those extra fifty dollars, we received nothing extra - towels were for two, cups for two, etc.  The decor was fairly straight-forward, but nothing I couldn't find at a Motel 6 or Shilo Inn.  I shudder to think what a \""Classic\"" would be like.\n\nFor being a \""themed\"" (I think?) hotel on the strip, there is near-as nothing done to work with the theme.  There is nothing about the hotel that says \""Asian influence\"", not in the way that Harrah's screams \""Mardi Gras\"", or Paris shouts \""European villa\"", or Caesar's tells you \""Roman Senatorial Bacchanal\"".  Ideally, they'd have more Asian art, suits of samurai armor, -something- thematically-appropriate.  About the closest thing they had in that regard were the ladies out front trying to draw people in: given that the entrance was covered in construction, they pranced about in jean shorts, hiking boots, orange vests and plastic hard hats.  Inside, the only attraction was \""celebrity look-alike dealers who all took a turn at either singing over or lip-synching a song by the celebrity they were impersonating (not entirely sure which).\n\nThe hallways for the hotel rooms were in pretty terrible condition (particularly for the price).  Carpeting was often loose and pulled up from the floor and stains were rampant throughout it.  More disturbing, trash found outside of rooms at 5pm on Friday night were still there by Saturday at 3pm.\n\nExpect to pay if you want to check in before 4pm.  Expect to pay if you want wifi (and there is no landline for internet).  No mini-fridge in the room.\n\nOn to the casino - as mentioned, nearly no theme except celebrity look-a-likes (because nothing says \""Chinese Imperial Palace\"" like dressing up as Rod Stewart?).  Out of I suspect two dozen gaming tables, only half of them were in use at any time.  The dealers were friendly, the servers attentive, and the pit bosses were professional and courteous.  The overall layout was somewhat cramped, but I suspect that is a function of the construction more than anything else - the poker room is on the third floor rather than the main gaming floor, most of the restaurants are on the fifth, iirc.\n\nIf you're looking for a \""Vegas Strip Hotel\"" experience, this simply isn't the place to go.  If you're looking just for a roof and clean bed, there are cheaper options just a block or two off the strip, and otherwise just as centrally-located.  Hopefully, the construction will lead to them making it more Vegas glamour and less Indian res casino meets Motel 6."
0,"Woodman's is cheap! Oh yeah, they're also an \""employee owned\"" business. The employees don't seem to reap any benefits, or I'm sure they'd smile one or twice.\n\nIf spending less money on garbage is your idea of ideal shopping, here's your gold mine. The atmosphere of the building is by far the 2nd worst grocery shopping environment I've experienced. I reserve the absolute worst for the no longer existing Star Market, in my home city. \n\nHere, the employees always look depressed. The lighting appears to be up to date with the 1970s. The produce selection is ready for the compost heap. Everything about the meat counter reminds me of the setting for an old horror film. If time is money, then I'd rather pay more for my food and spend a few hours less in line.\n\nThey do have a larger selection of natural foods than the average conventional market, but that's only one thing that allows me to occasionally decide to visit Woodman's. The other, they're open 24 hours. That alone, is why I cannot give them only 1 star."
1,"I had seen Dr. Saud at his older office a couple of years ago. When I needed more testing done I found that he had moved locations to horizon view medical center. While getting someone to pick up the phones has been difficult,  they squeezed me into the schedule right away, and got me set up for the procedure I need. Dr. Saud and his staff treated me Like a priority and i truly appreciate that. Would recommend him to anyone."
1,"A non-chain (Italian) restaurant in Glendale/Peoria. The calamari appetizer was very tasty, we got Mediterranean which has a buttery dipping sauce and feta cheese. Otherwise, I thought the food was good and the prices were right. The wine list is not long (and they seem to have every level of Chianti Ruffino), but if what you want is a reasonably priced dinner with reasonably priced drinkable wine, this is a good choice. And it's not a chain. \n\n(I have to agree with all the previous reviews as well.)"
1,My wife and I found this place while looking for something to eat before a Suns game.  Great little sandwich shop with good food and great prices.  I had the steak wrap and my wife had the chicken caesar wrap with the jalapenos.  The food was perfect pre-game food and it's location was walking distance to everything.  I highly recommend Coney Islands for good inexpensive and quick food.
0,Love the Sierra gold in Henderson. .... this one on Jones plain sucks!!! Takes 15-20 mins to get acknowledged at the bar. ..then another 5 or 10 to Get a drink.    One of very few places I've came in and sat waited and finally left. ...tonight I sat at a machine plaYed forty dollars and only saw a bartender from a distance..... I will never come back! !!!
0,"I don't understand the hype. We spent our honeymoom in Vegas. In the summer. Loads of fun (and sweat. Ick). I'd managed to convince my new food-averse husby to try out this place. I'd heard stories. I'd even checked out Yelp. But why? What for? It's just not worth the price for barely flavored fried chicken strips and krinkle fries. I'm pretty sure I have the same exact types of chicken fingers and fries in my fridge. The sauce was the only thing with any flavor...and it had no kick. Very disappointing, but they do get a star for good customer service."
1,"Honestly this is the best Indian food I've had aside from homemade! This was the first restaurant I went to on moving to Vegas. Service was so wonderful. We went in for dinner although they do have a lunch buffet which I definitely plan on going to. We had the owner as our host who recommended their 4-course (I think) special. Came with papadums, chicken appetizers, a sampler selection of entrees, and pistachio ice cream. After talking with the owner and getting to know him he let us try the rice pudding which was absolutely wonderful too. The place was almost packed within 30 minutes of opening, and for good reason!"
1,"Remember that scene in  \""Harold and Kumar\"" when the finally get the burgers and it's amazing? \n\nThat's what eating at Lenny's is like. When you show up during the lunch rush, it's a madhouse. Fire, meat, people yelling, the smell of fries, it's amazing.\n\nThe  metal walls with neon and 50's pictures help increase the awesome of this restaurant. \n\nThey serve up a decent amount of food, from chicken, to burgers, to shakes and cheese fries. This place is very \""diner\"", and I have always had great food here."
0,"Half Price Books is way over rated.  (1)  Has a lot of old, mangled paperbacks, mostly romance, (2)  Current and best sellers are meager, probably picked over by the staff, (3)  Bring in a current or best seller to sell and if you get a penny on the dollar, you're lucky.  You would be better served to donate your books to Good Will and taking the tax deduction.\n\n I used to go to this store a lot, but when they opened their Camelback location, it sure seems the way they financed it was to rip you off on the amount offered to buy your books and the quality of books in-store went way down hill.\n\nMy father-in-law had run in to the same problems, he being also a prolific reader, and he has quit going to Half Price Books."
0,A rare miss for yelp and Montreal\n\nGiven the outstanding reviews and the fact that I have had very few bad meals in Montreal I had high expectations for this place. \n\nDuring my first visit for lunch I was really impressed with the Duck BLT (BDLT). Overall it was probably a 3.5 star experience but delicious nonetheless. The prices were good and service was friendly. \n\nGiven the proximity to my hotel I decided to give brunch a try here the next day. This was a huge mistake.  I did get take out and I'm not sure if this impacted the food quality but it was probably some of the worst brunch I've ever had. Terrible french toast and eggs benedict. Everything else was average at best. Waste of about $60 because we didn't even eat half of the food.\n\nSorry to disagree with all of the positive reviews but I won't be returning here.
0,"a gigantic bar in the middle of nowhere (almost) that offers your typical bar food (ok-ish) and somewhat inexpensive alcohol\n\nthe place is crowded and loud. as for service, decent at first but they tend to forget you as the night goes\n\nthe crowd is a mix of locals, out of towners/travellers who are staying at the hotel next door and people who are there for some escort services (because of the hotel next door). well, from asking around and confirmed by some. so you wouldn't feel out of place here as you get a bit of everything\n\nfor me, it's way out of my way, i'm not much of a sports bar person, there's better out there and i got some bad service hence the low score"
0,"My family and I had purchased tickets online to attend the St. Patrick 's day festival and have a nice lunch at the pub.  When we arrived, we decided to go to the festival first, right at Noon when it was scheduled to open.  Mass chaos with pre-purchased tickets, designated driver tickets and wristbands.  Waited until 12:40 and the festival STILL wasn't opened.  We asked for a refund on the festival tickets, and wanted to go eat at the pub for a nice, authentic Irish meal.  Once we arrived at the pub, we were informed that no one under 21 was allowed in today.  That was not on ANY of the festival information - flyers or website!  The whole event was disorganized; non of the management nor staff knew what to do or expect."
0,"A month ago I took my car in for a hit and run repair after a friend reassured me that this shop was decent. My insurance company recommended it and the shop originally estimated the repairs to be a three week job.Its been an entire month with minimal communication between the shop and I to the point where I have been calling and having to go through voicemails to speak to anyone. Goes to say I am very upset with the professionalism of this shop that seems to be taking their time based on the fact that they will get paid regardless of how much time I have been waiting now for panel bodywork only. I will definitely not recommend this place for anyone looking to receive their vehicle on the time appointed. Since I still have not received my car I cannot speak about the actuall bodywork but I can say that they have already cost me more money, time and effort than any other business has before. One more thing, today is christmas eve, the shop told me the car would be ready today, today I have received no calls whatsoever in regards to my car and when I went down to the place I found no one there, they must have closed early...thanks for letting me know Gerber. I will update this review once I receive my car which may go over into the next year from the looks of it."
1,"Found this interesting boutique hotel through an excellent deal on Expedia. I was expecting just an average/acceptable hotel, but was extremely impressed. I am not a huge fan of modern art, so the art collection was not a selling point for me, but the overall accommodations are outstanding. The rooms are beautiful and very well appointed with all of the luxuries (e.g., thick robes, comfortable beds) that one would expect from a much more expensive hotel. The high ceilings in the rooms make the space feel very grand and open. The staff was very friendly and helpful. With so many cafes in the area, we didn't bother eating in the hotel, so I can't speak to the food. The location is perfect: right in the heart of old Montreal and just a few short blocks to the Metro station. I would heartily recommend this place to anyone looking for a hotel in Montreal."
1,Best Happy Hour deal from any restaurant in town!!! Great menu selections and served perfect every time.  Ward 8 is my favorite bourbon drink on the menu and the wine selection is perfect.  Their wine pad helped me choose a perfect wine for my steak.   Love this place for any occasion!!
0,"We went to the location at Sahara and Durango in Las Vegas.  I agree with some of the others.  The food was overpriced and could have been better.  My theory is that they are trying to improve flavor with salt, (like in the stuffed grape leaves) and sugar, (the strawberry shake.)  If they want to charge higher prices, they need to improve the flavor with a balance of ingredients, and the sugar or salt shouldn't dominate. Most people can see through over salting and over sweetening.  Also the chicken gryo on the salad was overcooked and greasy.  It was almost woody.  The Greek salad was good, but you can get those anywhere these days.  The albondigas soup was also very good, but for those prices you expect everything to be memorable and top notch.  Five dollars for a pot of tea sort of makes you feel like a sucker. \n\nThe music was loud, and the decor was fun.  it would be a nice place to go to celebrate a special occasion if you could get your money's worth.\n\nWe were there at 9:00 at night.  Perhaps the food and service is better on another shift.  Still. . ."
1,Brent was my tattoo artist and he did an amazing job on my flower mandala. He had good ideas and knew what he was doing.
1,Really good tasty homemade food. Some items you have to wait about 25 min. Any way I'll go back....
1,"Good food for the price, great rice, beans and their gourmet shrimp tacos made to order"
0,This place is the worst. They take reservations and then you arrive and they refuse to honor it and say it's an hour wait for walk ins.
1,"This is a solid 4 stars.  Today I had the pork banh mi and small pho with meatballs.  The pork was marinated and sliced thinly along with julienne carrots, cucumber spears, cilantro.  Delicious!  The pho was hearty, just enough for a soup and sandwich combo.  Nice side veggies to dump in, some Thai basil, sliced jalapenos, bean sprouts.  I hadn't been here since the Five and Diner closed.  But I certainly will return for this one.  Terrific food!  Service could be a little better."
1,"Last meal of our trip.  Oh my gosh, my husband almost had to roll me out - and I thought I was being good by only sampling a wee bit of everything.  But it's a whole lot of bits.  Ribs, lamb, chicken wellington, steak, several kinds of fish, pizzas, duck legs...  how could I not try all of it?  \n\nMy favorites - the fresh shrimp and the ribs.  Oh, and throw on a cheese blintz.\n\nDesserts, which I couldn't even eat this time, has something for everyone.  Fresh fruits, pastries, cakes, bread pudding...\n\nFast and friendly table service as well.  \n\nThe line gets long, so if you can, try to get a line pass.  We learned this trip that the check-in desk only gives out line passes for those who stay in suites now (I guess they were giving too many out).  Try asking someone at the slot club desk - they give them out there (obviously, you have to be signed up with a slot card)"
0,"Just went in there to take my dogs out and get some food. Been coming here with all my dogs all my life. We use the rude groomers and the nice vet. We spend a lot of money there. It's close to my house and never had a real problem. Today was very bad. So I lost $100 out of my pocket at the store. My bad. So I asked the girl to hold my purchase for a sec till I went to the car and got My purse. Dogs still need to eat. I also asked her to go over the intercom and see if anyone found $100 bill. Went to the car, started it, put the dogs in, grabbed my purse and went to pay for the food. She already had it out back and didn't announce my missing money over the intercom. So I asked her to do it again and went and got my food...again. I came back up and asked her again if she could announce I lost money and she tells me that some guy just found it but gave it to the person leaving the store! Seriously??? I asked her why she didn't say something to them and she said sorry. Then I leave, call a manager and he's says Sorry, it's not their policy to announce anything over the intercom and she was new so too bad. Fucking RUDE!!! I didn't ask for them to give me money, all I wanted was for them to ask if some one found it. If she did ask then that man would have given me back my money. Horrible customer service and the manager was worthless too. That would never fly at my company. Looking for a new store and groomer for my 3 dogs and the thousands of dollars we spend on them there. Not to mention putting this all over Facebook for all my family and friends in the area to read. Work on your customer care!!!"
0,"I Had the worst costumer service at this location.  I made a reservation online and when I went in to pick up and try to pay they need two bills to proof of address plus my license. So after driving back home and driving back they said that my bank statement would not be a sufficient proof and they needed a utility bill.  Then I ask to speak to a supervisor and the supervisor on duty gave us an attitude and then said \""I can refuse service,  however I  trying to help you.\"" I have been in customer service for a long time and threatening to refuse service is completely insulting to a customer.  As soon as he said that I just told him I would go somewhere else.  Complete waste of an hour and a half.  \n\n\n Although people who work there don't make the policies,  they should be trained to handle agitated customers."
0,"I liked the room. The customer service however was pitiful. The dealers were rude, the waitresses were rude. The valet drivers were rude, etc... Makes me want to spend my money elsewhere next time, that's for sure... No bueno"
0,"Initially it seemed like Desert Gardens was going to do a wonderful job on the big re-landscape project in our backyard.  At $27,000+ we expected a lot and Jenny led me to believe that she would be there supervising.  That was not the case.  The installers were nice enough but barely spoke English.  They said that Jenny never comes to the jobs.  The planting a were fine except for two $300 plants that were planted in the wrong place and got burned.   They would not replace them.\n\nJenny's brother was supposed to have done work on our barbeque island but instead it was delegated to  the plant installer who doesn't speak english.  The worst offense was that when they modified our Canterra stone counter, they moved a burner over about 12\"" farther away from the barbeque.  We thought it had been done properly, but  when we tried to turn on the grill we heard a very loud hissing.  We didn't try to light the grill, but if we  had the would have been a very big explosion because they had neither capped the gas line to the burner, nor connected it to the burner.  They just left the cut line wide open.  If we had tried to light the grill, the volume of gas pouring into the interior of the island (that was supposed to be connected to the burner) would have created a huge explosion.  We had to have a barbeque technician out to do the repair so we have all of this documented.\n\nSince we had our barbeque grill island modified, they had to replace part of the counter top.  It was supposed to have been done by Jenny's brother but instead was done by the plant installers who did a terrible job.  The Canterra stone top was very uneven and they left thinset all over everything including the barbeque grill which should have been removed or at least masked off for the counter installation.  The thin set won't wash off the existing tile and they chipped large pieces off the backsplash and just filled it with large holes with thinset instead of replacing the damaged tiles.\n\nJenny wouldn't return texts, and when her brother came out to see what needed to be done to complete the job, he was argumentative, telling me that the plants got scorched because they were planted too late in the season.  Since they were Yuccas, the plant won't ever replace those burned leaves (they were burned all the way up to five feet high on the plant), so the plant will forever looked wilted and scorched.\n\nOh, and the irrigation was connected to a house water line the was 1/2\"" not the to the water supply line from the street with requisite 3/4\"" minimum you need to get proper water pressure.  Consequently the heads don't always all pop up, and they were also set so deep that when the ones that do pop up spray, they are below the level of the grass.\n\nTo summarize, after leading me to believe that Jenny would supervise the installation Desert Gardens sent a bunch of unsupervised workers to do the job who didn't speak English.  I believe that over the three week course of installation Jenny showed up maybe two or possibly three times. No one addressed the problems.  No one followed through.  If they had been hands on and had been around to supervise, I believe that the job would have gone better.  They made a lot of mistakes and did some sloppy work.  The plantings turned out well for the most part not withstanding some difficulties where they would not be accountable for their mistakes.  The hard scape work was terrible and I would say, all in all, the fact that they did the job without supervision or follow through created a lot of problems.  I would NOT use them again."

Totally bit off Deep/Basque in Hollywood, and not as good because the broads don't even dance, she just sits there and primps at her vanity table...*yawn.  If you want it to be voyeuristic, make her do something MORE.  This is Vegas isn't it?!"
0,They don't do take out between 6-9 on the weekends bc of how busy they are...REALLY?
0,"I just had my car washed at this place for the fist and last time. I'm not a cheap person but who doesn't like to save a buck? I used a coupon for a touch free wash that included a hand dry and tire shine for $5.99. I wonder, if you use a coupon do they think you're cheap and assume that you won't tip so they do a horrible job? Because that's what happened, I showed the person the coupon and then the person straight out told me not to expect the water spots to come out, my response was \""that has never been a problem anywhere else I've had my car washed\"". The person used a soapy brush to wash the car before it went through the car wash which I thought would help get the car cleaner, then went through the wash and on to the hand dry. The person took maybe 3 minutes at most to put tire shine on and dry my car and it looked horrible. There is soap residue all over my windows and still have bird poo on the roof, hood, and driver side rear finder. I stood there looking at the roof which was still a mess so the person made a really bad attempt to wipe it again but still didn't get it any cleaner. The tire shine is in spots so the shine looks patchy, shiny in some spots and not in others. I work in a business where I get tips so I know how people depend on those tips therefore I tip according to the service I get. I never expect people to tip me and I know if I want a tip I have to earn it. As far as I was concerned this person did not earn a tip so therefore I did not leave a tip. I'll leave a tip on here to the person who did my car, if you do better work you'll get a better tip. If you do a bad job you won't get a tip, that's how tips work. And one more thing, just because a person uses a coupon does not mean they are cheap or won't tip so don't assume that and always do the best work you can, you might be surprised at how big your tips can be."
0,"Came here after a doctors appointment at St. Joes. We came around 11ish. Just a few peeps in the restaurant. The atmosphere was great, LOTS of decor but I was really in awe of the menu. Looked great! Prices were decent. I was told to get the Cowboy burger because it was \""really\"" good, eh, I've had better. It literally crumbled in my hands, maybe too much sauce? I don't know but with the use of a napkin, LOTS of them, I was able to eat it, come on, I was hungry. I do have to say the the french fries SUCK. Seriously. Don't give me half cooked fries. They weren't even crispy. It was gross to be honest with you and reading other reviews, looks like I'm not the only one who thinks they should work on their french fries.\n\nThe ONLY reason why I won't come back here is because we came in early, I witnessed them cooking a ton of burgers and putting them in a dish - waiting for the \""lunch crowd\"" to come in. That isn't fresh LENNY! How long are those cooked burgers going to sit there? Kinda not my thing."
1,"Their Philly Steak sandwich, meat and cheese in every bite, honestly very tasty! As a disclaimer I have never been to Philly so I cannot tell you how authentic this sandwich is, but honestly I do not care because it is that good. \n\nThe restaurant appeared very clean and picture my surprise when I asked for ketchup and they reached in the refrigerator and handed me a chilled bottle. Wow! I thought I was the only one with OCD to the extreme that the thought of using a ketchup bottle that has been sitting out, for who know how long, is so disgusting and that is the norm at most places, but not here.   \n\nThis place is well hidden behind a Mcdonalds, so make sure you get the address and set your GPS for the next time you find yourself hungry and in Mesa."
1,"My husband has been going here for years but I've only been a patient for 2 years. My appointments have always been very well organized, moving from one machine to the next, into the room and with the doctor. Everyone in the office has been friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.\n\nDr. Chrisagis has never seemed rushed although I assume he has many patients. He's candid and thoughtful in his recommendations.  \n\nI'm very happy to be a patient and will continue to be one for years to come."
1,This has been my favorite restaurant for about 20 years (obviously when they were called Houston's too).   I've eaten at the newer and older location about 100 times (combined). I have had 2 or 3 occasions that I felt were subpar but I realize everyone has an off-day here and there.  Still my favorite!!!
0,Checked in and got to room and bed not freshly made. Waited hour and half for housekeeping. She said if you want linens changed daily you have to request it and I told her I just checked in. She gasped. Woke up next morning and power out in bathroom...waited half hour for guy to come up and reset. . No hair dryer in bathroom or room. Not enough electrical outlets. And the most awful stone ages wifi/connectivity anywhere. A total zero of a stay. Never again.
0,"I don't know why I keep trying cupcake places...they are all overrated in my opinion. Much rather go to a bakery and get a slice of cake or something..\n\nAnyway..I really really wanted to like this place.  SUPER cute and clean on the inside.  The staff was very friendly and was more than willing to answer any questions about the product.  \n\nThey had some samples for us to try, which was nice.  Tried a vanilla and thought it was yummy, so we decided to get a box of six to sample.  (Came with free milk--SCORE!)\n\nGot the following flavors:\n\n-Red Velvet (2)\n-Midnight Madness\n-Wedding cake (vanilla) (2)\n-Texas Milk Chocolate\n\nWe left with a cute box and were very excited about our cupcakes.  Got to the hotel room and, like another yelper said, they are NOT good to transport.  The frosting was off of half of the cupcakes.\n\nI also see what someone else said about the amount of frosting.  It was a ridiculous amount of frosting!  I will not fault them for that though, some people may have that much of a sweet tooth..and I can always just scrape off what I don't want.\n\nNow, I'll stop rambling and get to the point:\n\nthe cupcakes were HORRIBLE, especially the red velvet.  Why would you put filling in a cupcake that already has a mountain of frosting?  Also, the filling was just sick and the cake did not taste like red velvet, but like a chocolate cake gone way, way wrong.\n\nThe vanilla was fine, Texas milk chocolate frosting was yummy, but the cake was dry and the midnight madness what just ok, but the frosting was way too sweet for my taste.\n\nWill NOT be back...SUPER CUTE place, but i'm not eating the ambiance."
0,"We played 18 holes today and was my first and probably last visit.  The course was in BAD shape, bunkers we rock hard, several had sand bags in the sand, lots of erosion, and you could walk in the bunkers, step out and they were so hard you couldn't see your footprints....they were that hard.  \n\nThe greens were weed infested with goose grass, looked like someone forgot to make preemergent applications this year....greens were mowed good but very bumpy from all the weeds. (photo below).\n\nSeveral fairways were covered with sticks and pineneedles, and markers were almost impossible to find.  Looks like it was a nice course back in the day, but it's not being taken care of very well today.\n\nGreens:\n\nhttp://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c399/unionturf/IMAG0833.jpg\n\nhttp://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c399/unionturf/IMAG0832.jpg"
0,"This place was great when it was Rave, now the customer service SUCKS.\n\nI ordered some tickets online for Godzilla for tomorrow, but now I need to cancel them. AMC's website doesn't give you any way to cancel them except to call their hotline. I've been on hold for 37 MINUTES and NO one has answered the phone. How am I supposed to cancel my tickets to get a refund when no one answers the damned phone? \""Here to serve you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\"" my ASS.\n\nI also tried calling the theater direct to see if I could get some help that way. Wouldn't you know it, called them four times and no one has answered yet. Did everyone who works for AMC keel over and die?! The fact that I've been sitting here on my phone for close to 40 minutes now to cancel some stupid movie tickets is absolutely ludicrous. I'll be going to Galaxy from now on, at least I know from past experience that they actually care about keeping their customers happy."
1,"It's weird how things happen.   I was reading the reviews about Egg Works on Wed and Thurs as something I really wanted to try on Friday.  I didn't mention it to anyone at work but that's what they decided on doing for Friday lunch.\n\nI was actually impressed.  Real spacious and nicely decorated barn look!? like the entrance to the restrooms.  There's outside dining area, a kinda private room for large groups, a breakfast counter for solo diners, TV's, WIFI.  Service was quick, it wasn't that busy because it was a later lunch.\n\nSo it looks like most of their menu were breakfast dishes since it doesn't look to be open for dinner. Most of the dishes looked really good and were large portions. I had the Spinach Benny which was really delicious but didn't care for the sides, a slice of grape fruit and pineapple, with some Works potatoes. Server hooked me up with a pretty good banana muffin which I didn't order.  Someone had the pancakes which seemed a good portion but heard it taste pretty basic. Others had the corn beef hash and some other really good looking breakfast dishes, I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu.\n\nI found a BOGO coupon online at Las Vegas Review Journal website lvrj.com and printed a bunch for our large group.  They said they don't usually honor these printed coupons unless they come straight from the newspaper but they honor it this time.  I'll probably be going to the other locations and see if they'll also honor the coupon or not."
1,Love this place...It is where I have breakfast when I visit Vegas....The food is not like the best food I have ever had ...but seriously they never disappoint if you need breakfast or some late night eats...
0,"Took my family there for dinner since it's the closest place for dinner when we are visiting family in the area. We had high hopes but were disappointed. The food was pretty good, not great, but not bad. It was the service that was challenging. The wait staff were very nice, but there just wasn't enough of them. If you requested a refill of your water, it would take literally 20 minutes to get it. Same with the check. I doubt we'll give it another try."
0,"I wish I could give zero stars. I really REALLY wish I could. This place does NOT provide adequate care to ANY of its horses.\n\nThey dumped rocks in my stalls, caused my horses to go lame due to stone bruising, NEVER cleaned the stalls or the waters and NEVER did ANYTHING they agreed to do in their own boarding contract!\n\nUpon repeated complaints by my husband and myself, Wayne told him that we weren't a good fit for the barn and that we complained too much so we needed to leave. He said that we only paid $275 a month and expected the service of a $600 a month barn.\n\nNo, Mr. Scott, we expected you to do what you agreed to in your boarding agreement! We expected you to do AT LEAST the bare minimum when it comes to horse care! \n\nHorses NEED;\nClean water\nclean stalls\nfresh bedding\nNo rocks in their stalls\nConsistent feeding of quality feed\n\nYou provided NONE of those services for our $275! We never asked you to groom them, turn them out, ride them, paint their feet in gold leaf lacquer or provide grain. You didn't do ANYTHING you were supposed to!\n\nWe plan on suing Papago Stables Inc. and it's owner, Wayne Scott,  for their neglect and fact they failed to render the services we paid for as well as the medical care my horses are undergoing in order to be brought back to soundness. We took photos of EVERYTHING.\n\nYou claim to have \""done this\"" for over 30 years. I've done it for over 20 and I will NEVER neglect an animal like you have mine. You have STAFF. That leaves you NO excuse. Instead of doing the work to keep these animals comfortable, you sat and played ping pong and drank beer while roping your cattle and donkey. All play and no work makes horse owners sincerely pissed off.\n\nI wont even get in to how badly you treat your dude string horses. Watching them spend the entire winter standing up to their ankles in mud created by their own urine and feces, that was NEVER cleaned until AFTER they left and seeing them never be brushed or bathed even when shedding and covered in that gross soup, made me want to cry. You'd think the thousands of dollars they brought you in over the winter would be enough to make you want to treat them right! I guess you figure they're just disposable and when one gets too sick to use, you'll throw it away and get a new one. How sick. You don't deserve ANY animals!\n\nPapago Stables is long overdue for being shut down and losing its license.\n\nOh... BTW... I now pay $250 a month per horse at a SHOW BARN and my horses are waited on hand and foot."
1,"Anyone that doesn't know about Big Jim's, you sir, are in for a treat.  I have been to this restaurant  dozens of times, and every time I have been here, It's been exactly the same.\n\nWhen you walk into Big Jim's, you look like you're walking into an abandoned dive bar,   It's not so clean, you can see the dust blowing around in the air, and there is 30 years of wear and tear, and the decor is a mix of old italian restaurant and catholic church.  the tables and chairs are ugly, and usually kinda sticky.\n\nNow that's out of the way, lets talk about service.  Abysmal.  There is one, two servers tops in the place, and you can wait up to 20 minutes to get drinks.  The food takes a bit of time as well due to the short staff, but this is standard in a dive bar/restaurant.\n\nSo you're probably saying to yourself, why did you give this place 4 stars Justin?  Weeeeelllll, the food is fantastic.  If you get a sandwich, expect it to be so big, you have to take a second, collect yourself, and formulate a plan as to how to even get this thing in your mouth.  The veal parmesan sandwich, is the size of a large dinner plate, and just stacked with fried veal (and only 11.95,  seriously?!)  The pizzas have so much cheese, it makes me want to weep.  I have never had anything on the menu that hasn't been cheap, oversized, and crazy good.\n\nFor your basic bar foods, this place is killing it.  If you don't mind waiting for it.  They have a short staff on at all times, but they're passing the savings on to you!"
1,"Here's my quick review of Lola's in Summerlin.  Yes, that's right.  Lola's has opened their doors in Summerlin.  If you've been to the location off Charleston near the Smith Center, then you know what to expect here and that's good grubbin' Nawlins' style.  Unlike the original location out here, this one has more space, doesn't seem to be as busy, and is a lot cleaner.  That being said, I'm still a fan of the original.  However, if I have choice, I'd make my way here when I'm craving the authentic stuff from Louisiana.  We dined on a mid-week night and it was far from busy.  Our servers were pretty good too.  But let's discuss what's really important and that's the food.  I got their the crab cake and their Bronzed Shrimp & Grits.  This was my first time trying their crab cake and it's huge, a creamy for a crab cake, and packed with flavorful crab.  As for their, Bronzed Shrimp & Grits, still as good as it get.  You get huge pieces of shrimp on top of their grits, sausage, and mushrooms.  This was seasoned just right and you can't go wrong with this dish.  In fact, this is the only entree that I have ever ordered when I dined at the original location.  I guess I should be try something different like their Po-Boys, the chicken & waffles, their jambalaya, or their oysters the next time I'm in.  But then again, it's too hard for me to pass up their Bronzed Shrimp & Grits."
1,"I stayed here a night before a meeting at the airport.  \n\nIt is typical of the brand.  Check in was fast and friendly.  \n\nThe airport shuttle runs every 30 minutes and it only takes 5 minutes or so to get to the terminal.  Park and fly fills up quickly so, make your reservations early."
1,"One of my family's favorite Sushi Restaurants. Great sushi, incredible service and friendly atmosphere."
0,The food is good and very authentic.. However...... On my visit today( it's been like 6 weeks) today me and my bf came for lunch.. The tacos are on a smaller tortilla and :) thy no longer double the tortilla because you won't get as full of course so you'll buy more!!! Morale of the story another greedy ass company!! Smh
1,"Sunday night, $30 cab ride from the strip and we arrive at a strip mall.  This had horrible written all over it.  As soon as you walk through the door everything changed, like when those kids walk through the wardrobe.  $55 three course and I had the foie, sweetbreads, and veal.  Amuse bouche for starters and all three dishes were perfect.  Finished with some cookies from the kitchen and they called us a cab for the trip back (another $30). Bonus for going on sunday nights, wine is 50% off.  The service was the best I have had in a long time.  This place is a must when in Las Vegas.  I might go to vegas just to eat at Rosemary's."
0,"I did not think it was possible to have Chinese delivery this bad. Every last offering was just the worst it could be. The rice was old and dry. The chicken greasy and... off (I will not go so far as to say spoiled, but I would like to). The beef dishes couldn't be eaten because they were tough, dry, and... um. leathery, yea - that's it. beef flavored leather. \nI only ordered from this restaurant because they pinned a flyer to my door advertising the establishment as \""New York Style Chinese Take Out\"", and if the meal that I received is what people in New York get for Chinese take out I really feel bad for them."
1,"Looking for a property manager? I recommend Fadra Kyle from First Serve Realty. We were moving out of the country, and needed a professional, reliable property manager for our house.\n\nFadra secured excellent tenants for our house, and has managed the small repairs without any hassle to us. At the six month mark, she completed a thorough inspection of the property with photo documentation. First Serve Realty also has an online section for rental owners, which makes tracking financials easy.\n\nHaving a property manager we can trust has been invaluable, especially considering our distance."
0,"Notice how I gave this place 2 stars....It's because their service is pretty much Number 2! They would not put up gutter guards for my sisters, who are not too good at bowling. They have some cranky guy running the only counter and seriously the only upside to this place is the Cosmic Bowling."
1,"The sushi was excellent, and the fish was very, very fresh, with wonderful texture and taste.  I graded Sushi Twister down a star because the rice kept falling apart (in both nigiri and rolls), and the Yellow Mango wiz Shrimp roll did not have much flavor.  Everything else was outstanding in taste, particularly the Vacation Roll.  \n\nIt's a new favorite sushi spot for us, and we won't hesitate to return."
0,"Its ok, I guess. But it reminds me off chinese food prepared for a mexican clientele. Everything has mexican spices in it. Even the meatballs - WTH? Meatballs are italian. ? But they do carry crawdads year round- but they to have mexican spices in them."
1,"Ok some hole in a wall places are worth taking a peak. This would be one. The one in Casa Grande and the one in Arizona City are very good.\n\nPros. As close to authentic as a Gringo like myself wants to get. Great quality, Large portions, and the flavors are well balanced.\n\nCons. Casa Grande has out door seating only, which means if its hot or cold so are you.\nArizona City its an half hour drive."
1,Best and most genuine studio in town!  Anonymous donation box by door. Come at awkward times during the day and it will be very small if not private classes (valuable attention from teachers). My yoga practice really grew because of this. Community yoga where you will instantly feel the great energy once you visit.
1,Favorite spot to get my nails done ^*^\n\nBeen going here for a couple months now and I can honestly report that every gel manicure has lasted at least 2-3 weeks without lifting!! Harry is amazing! Ask for him.\n\nSummer is here... so those toes are about to see the light of day which means I have to make sure that they aren't lookin ratchet. \n\nPedicures here are good...not awesome BUT to be fair I am extremely ticklish and giving me a pedicure is nearly impossible. I'd say that they did a good job with what they had to work with. \n\nVery clean shop. Staff stresses the little steps which makes a huge difference. \n\nGet in. Get out. Look fly.
1,"I loved Ghost Bar. As soon as my girlfriend and I walked through the door, our jaws dropped at the view ahead of us. The lounge feel when you first walk in opens up onto a veranda 56 stories up. The view of Las Vegas is amazing and quite enjoyable for us as the place was not too crowded. \nThe staff was nice and the music was bumping. No complaints at all about Ghost Bar. I only hope that next time we go, there is a bit more of a crowd to mingle with. Can't wait to head back!"
0,"Was here about 10 am on Mon/27 Oct:\n- No longer accepts Groupon vouchers\n- $3 for a 20 oz bottle of Coke\n- No paper towels in the men's restroom (so do the employees just wipe their hands dry on their shirts, which is what I did to dry my hands)\n\nDon't think I'll come back."
1,"Johnny Rockets has been around for a while and it just continues to serve good food!\n\nThis location is located in Fashion Square's food court and here is what they do well.  Their menu is simple. You have burgers grilled to order, sandwiches, malts and shakes.  A few other things like fries and onion rings, but the menu is pretty straight forward.  \n\nYou can sit on a stool and have a more personal experience with your server, or order it at their Take Away station.  For some reason I tend to sit at the counter when I'm alone.  I know it's an illusion, but I tend to think I get my food faster by sitting here. LOL\n\nI really love their Egg Salad sandwich.  I know it's silly, but it reminds me of eating in a Diner or a Drugstore back in the day.  The Malts by the way are outstanding and we have never, ever had a bad meal here.  Simplicity at it's best.\n\nYes, Johnny Rockets is A-OK in my book, and yes, I am a fan.\n\nEnjoy!"
1,"Normally, I go into detail about a restaurant...but why bother when you know its going to be the same goodness everytime you go!\n\nGreat wine list for sure!\n\nSteaks always come out piping hot with the butter jumping off the plate.  Cut into the steak and soak up every last bit of that butter!  It will be a party in your mouth.\n\nDesert...you can't leave without!  Even just to take it home (if you are too full) is worth it.  \n\nYou won't be disappointed in this place...guaranteed!"
1,like it as much as the buffet at bellagio
0,"To the guy who kept shining that flashlight in my eye. I hate you. The fact that you kept doing it and are over the age of 4, just made me angry. To his server, my server, and the hostess - you couldn't have asked him to stop. I was getting visibly upset over this. Oh wait, you couldn't because you guys disappeared. \n\nSo once this stopped, and the server finally appeared, I ordered the Kobe Meatball lollipops and medium rare filet mignon.\n\nThe lollipops looked adorable, but they were covered in some sort of A1 style steak sauce that made all the dipping sauce the pops came with impossible to use. After forcing 2 of them down, I gave up. \n\nThat must mean it's STEAK TIME!!! YAY!!111 Oh did it look amazing. I cut into it and noticed the center was cold. Oh well, I'll take it, close enough right? I take my first bite and it went *crunch crunch crunch* the outside was so burned I was surprised I could taste anything but the char. Oh no, was able to taste a boatload of pepper. I went for another bite, this time not a corner. The inside had a bad taste. Very Bad. It tasted the way I think saliva smells. Gross. One last bite. Third time's a charm right?\n\nI had a bite of pure pepper. I couldn't taste anything but pepper. I drank down all my water to get the taste out. I still tasted it 15 minutes later. At that point I was done.  The server came by asked the problem and I told him that my Sizzler steak had a rotten taste, and was pure pepper. So nice of him to take it away so I didn't have to keep staring at it in disgust. \n\nNext time I'm just going back to Ago."

0,"2 pm on a Thursday, no customers other than myself , and 3 employees standing at the cash register. No hello, no offer to help, just lots of personal socializing and all 3 looked me up and down while mumbling to themselves. Wow really..Hi haters! I'll never be back to this store again."
1,"Really enjoyed dinner here.  Live music, great waiter and tasty food at a reasonable price.  \n\nKid friendly but be warned the music is a bit loud for little ones.  (Hey, it's Vince Neil's place..  if it wasn't a bit loud it'd be just wrong.)\n\nI ordered the Krispy Kreme Burger.  If you like Krispy Kreme donuts (and who doesn't!?) and burgers, it's a must-order.   Loved it!"
0,This company are complete thieves charged my account twice and also did to a friend on another location!! Very unprofessional!
0,"So I decided to go to Portifinos (on Arsley) because I had been to the one on Park and really enjoyed it! The service was great- the food excellent! \n\nUnfortunately the three other times I have gone to this Portifinos I have had literally the opposite experience (although these times have all been for lunch and the time at Park was for dinner)\n\nThe first time was on my birthday (I know what a bummer) ...My co-workers and I split a large NY style pepperoni pizza and for dessert I took a piece of tiramisu back to work with me. The pizza was less than ok- very salty, super oily . The thinness was correct- but it just wasn't right (I should have known better being from NY but I figured my dinner was so good the time before)....The dessert was WAY worse, so disappointing! I had to throw it out because the cream had gone bad ....it was just awful.\n\nThe second time I went to this location was also for a work lunch...this time I went back to the original pasta dish I ordered the first time I went to dinner on Park. The pasta noodles were mush - and my co-workers had a similar bad experiences with their chicken (on pizza, and a sub) being overly dry. To make matters even worse our service was awful- and we sat waiting a very long time for our check ( a two hour lunch here is a bit much-it wasn't busy!) \n\nthe third time was unfortunately not a charm...I had the chicken parm dish- which  was at best mediocre.\n\nGo to the one on Park if you really want to try it...I won't be going back."
1,"Went to L'il Brown Sugars and in addition to the wonderful cupcakes, cookies and gooey bars, they now have the most beautiful decorated sugar cookies!  They are delicious and I would highly recommend them for any occasion you may have!"
0,"The food was decent.  The service was terrible.  When we got to the restaurant, there were only seven occupied tables.  Only one waitress, and a man who seemed to do nothing except deliver change and receipts.  It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to take our order.  Food came out pretty quick after that.  We had to refill our own water glasses... thankfully the water pitcher was left on an empty table.\n\nAs for the food.  It was decent but nothing spectacular compared to other Chinese restaurants we've been to in the past.  \n\nSeven tables is a lot to expect for one waitress.  I would have been more understanding if she was efficient or the man \""helping\"" on the front end was doing something to help her.  We normally start our tip at 20% and go up from there.  The service experience was so bad here, we left 10%."
0,Have been a regular buyer from the Fashion Square Lacoste - then I went in today - and experienced the worst service I have same. ever experienced.  The lady who described herself as the Sales Manager who was working on November 25th - has no business in retail.  Her utter contempt for her customer (Me) only took a couple of minutes but it cost Lacoste all my future business.  Will spend my money elsewhere and recommend others to do the same
0,"I've never eaten here but have been here for the drinks and music. This place is always beyond packed so my husband and i decided to check it out. It's a nice venue with nice staff. What I don't care for is the music. If you love top 40s, then this is your place to be."
0,Pricey. Carnitas were fantastic and the guacamole was exceptional. Margaritas were watered down and my girlfriends fish tacos were dry. Mexican restaurants should have better drinks than this.
1,We celebrated our anniversary last October at The Barrymore. We have eaten at many of the top named places in LV and The Barrymore served better food with excellent service. The dry aged ribeye was the best steak of my life! We will return during our next trip in May.
1,"I got as close as I could get to Cajun cooking in Las Vegas. Chef Hollomon brought spicy and savory to the table and made the end of this epic night more incredible. We had 1/2 dozen raw oysters, which was better than anything I'd ever had. Then we shared the combo pan roast, which had shrimp, crab and lobster, and bouillabaisse, which was the perfect marriage of seafood all in one pot. I HIGHLY recommend this place for anyone who loves Cajun style cooking. On a sidenote, you can gauge the spice on a scale from1 to 10, depending on your preference. Enjoy this diamond in the ruff!"
1,Great tasting pizza!!  Its not traditional NY pizza but its amazingly good!  Coal brick oven pizza and plus they make their own cheese which you can taste the freshness.  I'm not a fan of greasy food and this place works well with my cheat days while I'm dieting.  The salads are super good too!
1,"Where else can you go for a buffet that tastes better than Todai and pay half the price?  Well, go to Buffet @ Asia.  I found out about this place when we were at a friend's house in Henderson.  \n\nI feel their selection is just as good, if not better than most buffets.  They have a good selection of food.  Sushi, crab legs, sauteed lobster, mongolian bbq, an assortment of foods from different areas of Asia, and a good dessert bar with a chocolate fountain.  Whenever we go there, we spend hours getting fat.  If you go with me, maybe you can watch the \""Bottomless Pit Experience\"" where my friend eats as many plates as he can.  Trust me, you'll love it here."
1,"Place has an old Arabic architecture, even the aura ( mainly because of the spices)  reminds of Arabian culture. Food is priced reasonably and tasted good.\n\nOne thing I noticed that it has no female servers because of conservative Arabian culture."
1,I had the chicken and dumplings it was great. My husband had the meatloaf  his plate was clean when we left. Service was friendly and guick   The place was clean and neat.  Would go back
0,"GROSS! I went through the drive thru but had to go in because after waiting 10 mins my food  was still not done. Don't go in. It's filthy! Grease everywhere. Thick old grease. They hadn't even started my order. ....glad I didn't keep waiting. ...and threw it all in a bucket. I ordered extra crispy and got extra greasy. I think I pissed then off because my food was all smashed when I got home. \nIf you want fried chicken and you are on the area, go to fry's on Val Vista. Hot, crispy and fresh. \n\nWhat happened to kfc? Ugh not returning."
1,Really good Chinese food. I always get Singapore rice noodles and add extra vegetables and I've never been disappointed. Hot and sour soup is good and they are really quick for take-out. Owners are very friendly.
1,"This was the best restaurant I have been to. I haven't been to many fancy places, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the food here was amazing! My friend and I were in Vegas last weekend walking the strip and just happened to see it. There was a small line which was great but it was also 2am. We each got an IPA which was priced well at 8 bucks, and was also delicious. We started with the hummus, and let me tell you, I have had hummus everywhere and this was easily the best I've ever had. It came with bread and fresh grilled veggies both in butter and garlic salt and I never wanted to stop eating it. My friend ordered the Farm Burger which he said was fantastic and I got the Portobello Mushroom Burger, which I've never had before, but at this place is now my all-time favorite burger. I can't even explain how good it was. We also shared fries which were good. The server was fine, nothing amazing but he was very nice. It was expensive for burgers but it didn't matter because we were in Vegas and the food blew our minds. I will now go here every time I go to Vegas, and will try to find more Gordon Ramsay restaurants."
0,"This place would be nice in theory except for 2 very important things.  1 there service is awful, 2 there prices are awful. There are several other places a cigar smoker can go with much better service and prices. Smoke cigar lounge in collier, the oyster house in pleasant hills, castle tavern in castle shannon, chippino in the strip,level 40 in robinson etc."
1,"The Skinny: excellent pub specialities done right - perfection of the Irish pie! (4) service - a little sluggish but it's a pub (3), value: $11 for the steak and mushroom pie with the fixin's and $15 for a healthy portion of fish and chips (4).\n\nA big shout out to the Yelpers - they were on the money with this place.\n\nThere are alot of things to love about this pub - first is the ambience. From the dark wooden panels on the wall to the true Irish transplants serving you, it give this establishment a feel of authenticity. The video poker area is well cordoned off from the pub and hence relatively smoke free.\n\nWe ordered a plate of their fish and chips and an Irish steak and mushroom pie (which takes 20 minutes but is worth the wait, my friends). While we were waiting, a neighbouring table were served their orders of fish. The reassuring crunch as they dug in signalled that McMullans ain't messing around when it comes to their food.\n\nWhen our fish and chips arrived, we were surprised at the substantial portion (perhaps we would order the appy sized portion next time). Three large fillets perched on top of a mountain of fries with some coleslaw and tartar sauce. Perfect. The plate was also free of grease which was another good sign.\n\nThe fish was in a beer-battered style and had a perfect ratio of batter to fillet. The batter was light, crispy and held up well despite all the dunking into various sauces. Best of all - it wasn't oily. The chips were mid-sized cut and crispy. Overall, they held their texture pretty well with the passage of time. The coleslaw was pretty standard fare. The tartar sauce, though, needed a little tartness and sweetness but was okay.\n\nThe steak and mushroom pie was a wonder. The flaky dome arrived at the table accompanied by a mound of mashed potatoes and buttered peas. The filling was a satisfying combination of beef and mushrooms, stewed with some kind of flavourful ?beer. \n\nThe most amazing thing was the pastry. At first we thought the pie was in a ramikin but it was completely freestanding - that really speaks to the robustness of the crust. The pastry was flaky and crisp all the way around (including the bottom which normally tends to get soggy). McMullens has truly perfected the art of the Irish pie. The mashed potatoes were solid - had a nice flavour and a great gravy but could have used a little more texture. The buttered peas were good.\n\nOverall, with these pub favourites done so well plus some rather interesting Irish beer and whiskey flights at affordable prices, this is the place to go for some Irish comfort."
1,"My review is a little late coming but I really enjoyed Happy Hour when I was in Las Vegas for the final days of my campaign.  My work colleague and i decided to try Cana because of the 1/2 off mojitos.  I probably could have drank like 10 of them.  I tried the strawberry, original, cucumber mojitos.  DELICIOUS!  I had two strawberry.\nThe small plates were also delectable.  Each had their own personality.  And we even ordered the churros for desert.  \nThe waitress was awesome and one of the chefs even dropped by.  If I ever go back to vegas, I will definitely hit it up again."
0,"Well I had many options, the mom was in town and I decided on Rare 120 for my birthday dinner. I based my decision on the fact that I joined a friend here once and had a bite of his steak and thought it was excellent. After being seated and looking around I enjoyed the overall ambiance but looking into it a bit further it was a bit off kilter. The chairs tables and carpet gave the room kind of a modern lofty feel. With the need to be funky or different they have some chandeliers, cowhides on the ceiling which offsets the loft feel with a bit of lounge, not terribly beneficial for the overall look. 7/10 I have to say the chairs are fantastic though.\n\nAfter looking over the menu none of the apps or salads really sounded that interesting (tomato soup and mini grilled cheese, kobe carpaccio...boring) so we just went ahead with entrees and sides. Petite filet,  mash potato trio (truffle, lobster, rosemary?) and creamed spinach were the taste of the day. The steak was a perfect med rare crispy on the outside and really excellent and buttery. This was one of the few steaks that I felt didn't need a sauce to taste great. That could have been because we tried the Rare 120 house sauce...a sweet tomato-y tin of nonesense. The mashed potatoes were below par, the lobster mash had the consistency of polenta or grits and all of them were over buttered and pretty grainy almost instant tasting. Creamed spinach...meh. Dessert was HORRIBLE....the selection was between ice cream sandwiches...snooze, white chocolate bread pudding...gross? 6 cakes which they offered a volume discount for 1 for $4, 3 for $10 or 12 for $36...LOL or the one I chose, the creme brulee trio. Creme brulee is a favorite of mine but unfortunately they just can't get it right here. All three were way to firm and dense like the fridge was too cold. The vanilla was solid overall, chocolate was mediocre and didn't really taste like chocolate and the caramel creme brulee was the kicker, one of the worst desserts I've ever tasted. Food gets 3/10 thank god for the meat!!!\n\nService was adequate,  more of a \""hello\"", \""how is everything\"", \""still working on that?\"" type service. I typically tip 25%-30% but we felt 20% was more fitting for this outing to sum things up. I felt service was professional with the exception of the busboy. I'm giving him a pass because he was a bit slow..possibly foreign. While we were still eating he walks up and just blurts out  \""You guys done?,\"" I responded \""not quite yet,\"" he replied \""oh\"" and scuffles off. I know the hard rock is known for casual, rocker types but that's a bit weak. Later we had dessert on the table and they neglected to remove our bread luckily the busser walked over and said \""you guys done with bread\"" lol crisis averted. Service 7/10\n\nAll in all its not quite there. With Cut, Delmonico and Strip Steak offering direct competition it seems like the only thing Rare 120 has going for it is its location and the fact that Hard Rock is expanding. We'll see what happens.....actually you'll see what happens, I won't be back."
1,"i had low expectations of this place. It looked very deserted from the outside and especially in the inside!\n\nI went here with a couple of friends..one of my friends ranted about the beers. I'm not a big fan of beers but checked it out anyways.\n\nSo the waiter was also the cook and bartender lol. He was pretty chill and funny..\n\nHe showed us his walk-in fridge which was filled with 1000s of beers!\n\nHe had a limited menu of the basic burgers, sandwiches, etc. \n\nI ordered a reg. cheeseburger..which was REALLLLLLLY GOOD. It came with waffle fries..and oh man that was good too!\n\nMy friend ordered the lucifier burger..and boy was it THE HOTTTTTTEST BURGER ever!\n\nThat burger belongs on MAN vs FOOD PRRRRONTO!\n\ni've tried a few beers...but can't comment much on it because again, i'm not a big beer fan. Although, the beer drinkers in my party were super satisfied and were ordering beers left to right. I believe some of the beers were unique and difficult to find at grocery stores or liquor stores. \n\nI'd def. come back when i'm back in vegas. I plan on taking my bf here so he can try it..hes a burger type of man."
0,"my girlfriend and I went there on a Tuesday food was great biscuts and gravy are good my pancakes and eggs and potatoes and Ham steak and 2 slices of bacon and side of patty sausage were good. \n\nWe made the mistake of going back again on Thursday morning.  I ordered the Pancakes again with an egg over medium. My girlfriend ordered the French toast and Scrambled eggs.  The food was horrible my GF French toast had no flavor whatsoever it was like they dipped it in egg batter and just threw it on the griddle no vanilla no cinnamon except for trace of it on the plate then the manager comes over and says \"" Well French Toast is dipped in egg batter\""  Like it was our fault the food was bland.  Then they use a cinammon roll to compensate for the regular french toast being so bland which was so sweet they should make you a dentist appointment after you eat it. \n\nNeedless to say I will never ever go back there again absolutley horrible food and horrible waitress and horrible manager.\n\nAlso if you do go to this abyssmal place make sure you don't bring your children they will have their life force sucked out by all of the senior citizens waiting for the bland souless meals that pass for food in this place."
1,Great Thai good! I got the green curry with tofu and it's amazing! Great spice too! I called in my order for pickup and it was ready in 20 minutes! Would highly recommend.
0,"Their affiliation with gorilla, a group that plays the game of bands selling tickets to play, is why they get one star.  The ticket game is just to rip off bands who simply want to play.  They could instead grow a reputation of being a venue that attracts quality talent and then the audience will come.  Instead they go the low quality route.  Not impressed."
1,"Just left there and had great customer service. I ordered prime rib and the cut  was tough and very difficult to chew.  I ate what I could and when the waiter came to remove our plates I mentioned that the prime rib was not good at all. The waiter apologized and said he would let his manager know. A few minutes later the manager, named Joe came to the table and asked me to tell him what was wrong with the prime rib. I explained that it was hard to cut and chew and that it looked like an end piece and that I didn't order an end piece. He apologized and agreed and told me that they don't serve end pieces unless the customer specifically asks for it. At the end of our conversation he told me that my meal was taken care of. I will definitely come back because of that excellent customer service experience."
0,"My fiance and I stopped in here to pick up some treats. We often get the craving for something sweet and enjoy trying new places. We decided to stop in after reading many of the reviews here. \nIt took a bit to get there since they are in Anthem but no big deal. When you first walk in you immediately understand the name.\nWe ordered a couple of cupcakes and a macaroon. I was immediately let down the by the macaroon, it was as if two cookies were put together with some filling in the middle. Macaroons should be flaky and flavorful. This was neither. \nWe ordered four different cupcakes and they were. . . ok. . . i felt as if we could have gotten them from any supermarket. Sorry, but we wont be making the trip back"
1,"I have now been to Daily Dose 4 or 5 times and each time has been wonderful. Occasionally, you have to wait at the front for someone to acknowledge you and finally seat you but the short wait is worth it!\n  They serve breakfast until 3pm during the week and ALL day on the weekends. I enjoy the eggwhite wrap and always look forward to the large breakfast potatoes. My favorite part about breakfast is the homemade jam they bring with toast! I also love their burgers! The food is well cooked, creative, and delicious. \n They also have a wonderful happy hour that lasts until 8pm!  The specialty cocktails are clever but some of them are not well executed (too sweet).\n I love sitting at the bar or out on the patio. The service is always friendly and everyone seems eager to please. They put cucumber slices in the water which makes the tap water actually taste GOOD. These small attentions to detail really add up and make this place one of my favorites! I drive down from North Scottsdale just to eat here!"
0,Why I cannot give zero stars? The straff was very impolite and unfriendly when i asked some questions about the prepaid cards. They were not capable of giving right and useful information. Bad service!
1,Everything was great. Wish the craft beer selection was a bit better. Some draft would be nice too. Craft beer pairs great wiwith the excellent food.
1,"02/15/16\n\nForgive me, oh Lord, for I have sinned... I don't know what I was thinking eating a sandwich, side salad, AND drinking an entire blackberry mojito (it was sooooo good!) at a nearby restaurant when I could have just had a couple of bites there and then gone for a second cocktail here...  Of course, instead of ordering a cocktail (the flaming cocktail expert Richie Moe wasn't in the house, yo!), I decided to go for an espresso and try that delicious-sounding black & tan pudding http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA?select=eKxPXAmYF0fu0b38M4lpsA  our server said was his favorite dessert on the menu.  By the time the sweets arrived, I'd already inhaled the espresso, so I had to get a cup of drip coffee, black.  Oh lordy, lordy, lordy- what a beautiful combo the decadent chocolate pudding and luscious and oh-so-sinfully-creamy caramel (my fave of the two flavors), topped with fresh whipped cream and a peanut brittle crumble made w/ both coffees!  Yeah, me wanna love you long time!\n\nA shout out to our super-fun server, Newman.  What a terrific guy!  ;)"
1,"September 6, 2013\nOrder your To Go rolls ahead of time on a busy Saturday night -\nHubby & I had a sushi roll craving and since I Love Sushi has a really nice selection, we perused the menu and ordered:  Kanpai Special - the yellowtail was so fresh and I love the delicate, fresh flavors and the tempura shrimp in this roll (my favorite); Burn in My Stomach - yep, includes jalape\u00f1os and it was so spicy good; XXX - soft-shell crab but it was hidden amongst the creamy special sauce.\n\nPrevious Tip:\nThe afternoon is a great time to stop in and grab a bite\n\nPrevious Tip:\nCall your to-go order ahead of time to grab & go"
0,"My fianc\u00e9 and I stopped in for a sundae to top off our date night. We walked in about 30 minutes before closing. The staff was incredibly rude and made us feel very unwelcome, forcing us to sit at the bar (not at a table like we wanted) and at least 3 people came by advising us they are closing soon.\n\nI certainly apologize for walking into your establishment during normal business hours to get a few scoops of ice cream... what were we thinking..."
1,"Love this place!! Been here a few times, but it's hard to eat good food with the kids. Had to eat here for New Year's Eve. Husband left happy and full. The yellow tuna collar was so fresh and tasty, the fried soft shell crabs was nice and crunchy, and the teriyaki beef was delicious. Maggie was so nice that she appreciated us for waiting she gave our boys strawberry ice cream, which they ate till the bowl was spotless. We shall be back ^_^"
1,Awesome food and super friendly people. They have all sorts of options on the menu and the flavors are spot on. They also have an excellent salsa bar with lots of great options. Can't wait to come back!!
1,"Greatly enjotyed this newly opened museum.  the modern art, paintings, and different mediums (e.g., glass, clay, furniture) mixed it up and kept it interesting.  the museum is the right size to be able to spend a few hours relaxing and walking around without feeling overwhelmed if you don't see it all."
1,"I'm so in love this place. Great environment, Great people and the music is on point. If you love Osso, then you will love their other restaurant uptown called \""Blue\"" on College Street. Enjoy!"
1,"Ok I am at Rollin Smoke right now and I can tell you for sure this is one of the best places for bbq in vegas! Oh my goodness its so good! Ordered the beef short ribs (not short at all, almost a lbs of meat), loaded mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. Every single dish is phenomenal and the ribs are something special. The meat literally falls off the bone and is incredibly tender. The bbq sauce is just spicy enough and has perfect flavor. Love the atmosphere, just off the strip a little joint not hard to find. Great place 100% recommended!!!"
1,I have to give this place 4 stars the food is just really good. Every time I have gone to this restaurant it was delicious however it is very old and even the tables do not match you would not want to bring a large group of people because there is really only a few tables for large groups however there is also some nostalgia to the place because it is so old other than that it's definitely worth 4 stars and worth trying because of the food
0,"I used to like this place but unfortunately India Palace has slowly gone down hill. Waaaay down hill. Plus as I  learned, they have zero loyalty to their customers who eat there fairly regularly. Last night was the last straw. In fact my meal was like chewing straw and inedible. I ordered the Bhindi Masala which is a vegetable okra dish. I have had this several times before but tonight the okra was so tough that if I were to actually swallow it (rather than spit it out in my napkin-sorry gross but true) I guarantee my throat would have been scratched. Also our Roti bread was burned.Not once did anyone check to see how our meals were. When the waitress offered me a box for the uneaten meal at the end , I declined and explained the situation: I have had this dish before but it was like chewing wood shavings (explained it nicer than that) and she just said ok and brought us the bill with no offer to either replace it with another item or take it off the bill like 99.9% of establishments would do. So, they have lost our business and managed  to tick off a yelper over a VERY simple customer service issue."
1,"Four of us wanted to try this restaurant before going to see a show at the Hazlett Theater.  The food was excellent. We tried both the chicken and vegetable momos (steamed dumplings); we liked them both although we all agreed that the chicken was tastier. Among us we also ordered chicken biryani, chicken curry, and a lamb and pork dish. All were good, as was the naan. We ordered primarily from the Nepali and. Indian selections. The portions are generous and the food was very inexpensive ($44 for everything). The service needs some work, so I recommend leaving sufficient time if you are going somewhere afterward. Entrees were brought out one at a time (well, one, then another one, then two), but since we were all sharing it did not matter as much. I will definitely go back."
1,"Dr. Mary Deka is an amazing gynecologist! She makes you feel comfortable and at ease. I always look forward to seeing her. I am sure that sounds strange when one is talking about their gyno. :-) \n\nThe office is extremely clean, welcoming and modern. The staff at PV OBGYN are amazing as well! Dr. Deka's nurse, Grey, is wonderful.  \n\nIf you need an annual, or are looking for an amazing DR to deliver your baby, Dr. Deka is your girl! I would sincerely recommend her to anyone!"
0,The BBQ is good but not great.  The prices are close to a fine dining restaurant.  Not impressed with the food when you look at the prices.  Good selection but nothing is really over the top.  Generic flavor and high prices.
0,Well let's see they charge for towel if they are drity. They don't have housekeeping.on the weekends.  They make u wash your towels to get clean towels. Rooms smell like smoke even if it non smoking . swimming pool is hella cold. Ever take a chlorine bath don't jump in the pool.
0,"A friend and I bought a sampling of Silly Yak's egg-free, casein-free, and gluten-free baked goods. I had high hopes but ultimately everything we bought was dry, dense, and lacking in flavor. I rarely find anything truly inedible but this time I did throw my share away. A major disappointment after the other positive reviews."
1,Not bad. Coconut shrimp is awesome.
1,"This was strangely painless. You can check wait times online and see what you're in store for. The listed wait time was 14 minutes and I think I only really waited for 8 minutes. \n\nThe employees are friendly, fast and efficient- which can't be easy because it's got to be a hard job. \n\nAll in all- it was a very nice surprise. The test was quick and very nice service. Well done!"
0,"I can't possibly understand how this has gotten such high reviews. The food was extremely mediocre. Lots of items were bland. I wasn't impressed by the dishes at all. Very typical dishes for a crappy buffet (i.e. pancakes, eggs benedict, etc.)  I was there for brunch and lunch. The only thing I enjoyed was the prosciutto, but even that was not quality. \nAnd, the worst part is that NOTHING I ate was hot. I don't understand how I place like the Wynn, as pricey as it is, can't figure out how to keep their buffet food warm. (I've been to buffets that have been able to figure this out, and they're a lot cheaper)"
1,"Pour24 is not only on of my favorite bars in Vegas but anywhere. I went there a couple years ago on a trip to Vegas to my birthday so when I went this past week with my boyfriend, I decided to hit them up again, and again, and again. I think we went to this bar 5 times during the course of our week in Vegas.\n\nThe bartenders are all so funny and friendly and quick to recommend drinks. I had some of the best beers I've ever had at this bar. I highly recommend the Purple Haze and the Moose Drool if you go and they have it on tap. Also for the most bang for your buck, do the tasting menu. You can pick anywhere between 4 and 6 beers for $14-19.\n\nI plan on going back to Vegas this summer for a girl's weekend and when I will definitely be stopping by here again."
0,"WORST SERVICE I EVER HAD!!!\n \n\nWe booked this hotel for my birthday. It was pretty expensive so we believed we would have gotten great service for the amount of money we paid for the room. \nThe room was nice but we asked for a room with 2 beds (there were 4 of us and only one bed) when i requested the change the person helping us was snoobish, rude and sighing. \n\n When we requested help with our bags 4 or 5 times NO ONE helped us. They actually ignored us and started helping couples behind us. When we requested  something to help us stack our luggage so we could carry it ourselves we then again IGNORED. When we finally got our luggage downstairs the bell man made a derogatory remark about mexicans walking their luggage down (refering to us) to another staff member. \n\nWhile playing in the casino there was barely any servers and it took almost 45 minutes to get drinks that we ordered.\n\nIt was definitely a beautiful hotel but all staff was absolutely rude. It wasnt worth the money. Hopefully you read this before you stay, I am definitely picking a different hotel next time."
1,Called and they happened to have a tech nearby. They quoted within a 2 hour gap he would be here and he was here at the earliest chunk of that. \n\nTech's name was Robert and was extremely helpful and informative.\n\nWhat I enjoyed most was that he was honest and realistic with what needed to be done and gave us plenty of options and the pros and cons to doing them or not. \n\nI would absolutely call them up again for any other A/C or heating service.
0,"Absoltuly ridiculous!!! I've been here 3 times and never had such a hard time getting my nails done. Nasty man that works there with nasty attitude. Assuming he's partial owner. Everytime I go there it's after work, they advertise there open until 8. I get there there closed and it's only 7. Absolutely ridiculous attitudes! Will never ever go back!!!!!  0 review!!"
0,I was really excited to try Rhythm Kitchen. My assumption was that it was a cajun/creole type of establishment which for me the food lacked both cajun and creole and seasoning in general. I had the crescent city pasta with the cajun alfredeaux sauce. The dish is essentially seafood pasta with alfredo sauce. The cajun alfredo is a joke. Its not cajun and its not even good alfredo. it was too thin and lacked flavor. The shrimp were small and the spinach was all clumped together. Overall it was a lackluster meal. I probably won't be back to rhythm kitchen.
0,I don't think I'd ever come here again.\n\nI mean it's in a convenient location and it's great that they have pizza by the slice but it just isn't great.\n\nI rather have slices then this place....\n\nI tried the pepperoni pizza and it was decent....I also tried this chicken bacon ranch and it was not the business....but thats what I get for experimenting lol
0,"R.T. O'Sullivan's ( more than  six months back  things may have changed but my prior two visits had us   walking out re time it took to serve us/ and then  forgot to  cook part of the order. )\n\nIt's about as Irish as Sobriety  ( Yeah I have the Celtic passport to back that slander up) \n\nChicken Wings Plain, BBQ, Teriyaki, Mild, Medium, Hot, Death or HELL !(no returns on HELL) Served with celery and ranch dressing.\n\nI think I get it, they are being ironic... Because if you get what you want it's not hell!. \n\nThe thought of an Irish bar without cider is as laughable as a French bar sans wine or a burger joint that doesn't have   coke but would you like a nice green tea? Er no. \n\nNo hard apple cider in stock , please perry, aka pear cider is fine but it's not frickin' cider and there seems to be some reality problems with bars here. \n\nNM , ok I do mind .. The wings, HELL? , HELL-o I thought I was meant to be in mortal danger here. Seemingly a sauce mild enough to douche with is their idea of hell.. mine is paying $8 to be sorely disappointed, again. Gets better they totally forgot to bring out the wife's main course..   No black pudding on the menu and still insisting that Corn beef / cabbage is from the old country and not an American invention  oh well, it's a theme  ,it's not reality.\n\n  It's really an opportunistic \""schtick\"" to tie a  run of the mill sports bar with some character."
1,"Sooo I'm just a normal person from the burbs. I decided to spend an evening at Tryst with a friend in from out of town to give her the Vegas experience. Maybe the things I saw were normal for all you California cool kids, but the whole evening was so bizarre to me!\n\nTime in line: We had 2 girls, 1 guy in our party. We were dressed at about a 6 on the Vegas slutty scale so we had to wait like 8 minutes to get pulled out of line. Seriously if you have more chicks than guys expect to get pulled out.. not a big deal. Dudes are screwed.\n\nCover: $20 for us ladies, and $30 for our guy\n\nDrinks: We drank double red bull vodka (kettle/sky depending on the bartender). They were $21 and not a bad deal because seriously 2 was enough to get us feeling really really good. \n\nDance floor/Ambience: So it was crowded in there, but from talking to club going type people they say that's normal.. ok sure. I thought it was very beautiful, just smaller than I expected. \n\nMusic: A nice mix of 80's/trance/hip hop/alternative.. whatever. My only issue is that each song was only played in a 1 minute clip. Is our society that ADD that we can't handle an entire song? Are entire songs not trendy? Seriously I was sooo getting into singing Living on a Prayer (singing in Tryst is probably a no-no) and then it cuts to some random rap song from the 90's... my drunk self was so sad.\n\nBathroom: So the bathroom line was weird. While I was in line these bouncer guys escorted these 2 really slutty chicks to the front and waited for them then escorted them back out... hrm.. so apparently there's some sort of VIP bathroom service? weird.\n\nWeirdest thing of the night: Not one but TWO tables of douche bag guys decided it was cool to throw $100 worth of ones in the air. These were independent occurances. WTF, seriously I know it's just $100 but there are so many more interesting ways to burn through it. They were photographing each other doing this, and thought they were the sh*t cause they were throwing money on the ground.. seriously Vegas attracts some really mentally ill douche bag types. \n\nOverall clubs aren't my scene, but I had a nice time."
0,"Service is very slow.  \nThe menu doesn't explain any of the items and out waitress didn't know any of the ingredients.  The salad. Only. Had 3 ingredients... All of which were not worth 15$\n\nWe ended up leaving after there was no good vegaterian options and no solution was offered. \n\nWhen we said we're were going to leave our server did Zero to change our minds. \n\nI give it one star because we did get chips and Salsa and the Salsa was good.  The chips were not so great.  \n\nI would definitely never recommend this over priced place to anyone... Walk down the road to The yard house for a great menu,  healthy options and 150 beer selection.  And better prices."
0,Don't come for large portions. Food was good quality but a bit pricey. Service was rushed and inattentive.
0,"I have been to piano bars all around the country, from Miami to Cali and back and this was by far and without a doubt the crapiest one!!  I genuinely like piano bars since they can be a really fun place to blow off steam while enjoying a good show; not here!!!!!!  Never a good sign that the place was pretty empty on a Saturday night the weekend of Cinco de Mayo and the Kentucy Derby, but nonetheless I and four other guests sat down.  I can easily handle the unstable tables or that all of the chairs felt like they were just about the break apart, I'm actually good with that.  I can even handle the fact that it took our waitress almost 20 minutes to just say hi as she walked by to another table.  I would even go so far to say I can handle the horrible tasting food, it's a bar right????? Your there for fun, not a gastronomic awakening!  \n\nWhat made this place the crapiest piano bar in the United States was the continuous Barry Manilow cover songs with an interspersed Elton John number- and they were horrible at both!  The drinks are VERY short pours, let me say this again since it bears repeating- THE BARTENDERS SHORT POUR YOU TO THE POINT OF BEING OFFENSIVE.  I went up to the bar (which was empty as well, I can see pattern forming here.....) and was met by a young man who was giving me the \""what the hell do you want?\"" stare.   I asked to have my martini look like a martini and not a  1/2 shot in a martini glass.  His reply was \""well that's what you get unless you pay for more\"".  Holly crap, what a horrible place!  Here's the bill lowdown- 2 martini's, 2 Grey Goose mandarin and sprites- total bill-------- $72!!!  That's before tip (which they sure as hell don't deserve) or anything else since I paid for the burger with cash at delivery.  \n\nThere are a ton of other great piano bars in the valley and there are some good bars in the Glendale area, just stay away from this shit hole.  I would bet $20 that this place is closed by the health department within a year, that is, unless it goes out of business for being such a disappointment.  DO NOT GO TO THE SHOUT HOUSE IN GLENDALE, AZ.  Chewing tin foil would be more fun than going back there."
1,I made reservations for dinner here on a Monday night.  The restaurant was pretty nice and crowded.  They had Booker's bourbon at a good price which is nice.  I ordered the rigatoni and my wife ordered pesto fettuccine with chicken.  They were both delicious.  The pesto was rich.  The rigatoni might have too many onions for some.  Both dishes were in the A to B+ range.  The cost was very reasonable.
0,"Not so hot.  I don't see why everyone thinks HL is so great.  They don't carry anything you can't get somewhere else, and their prices aren't really any better.  1) The cash registers don't have anything itemized, so you can't refer back if you need it; the cashiers have no idea what's on sale.  (I went twice and both times my purchase was rung up incorrect; I not only had to tell the cashier the items were on sale, but she asked the MANAGER if she could give it to me at the SALE PRICE!!!!  (Point:  I bought ribbon, which was 1/2 price in the ENTIRE STORE - ALL RIBBON - and she not only wanted to know what department, but asked the manager if she could sell it to me at sale price.  ALL ribbon on sale, who cares what department, especially since their cash registers don't note that fact anyway).  She didn't know the price of anything on sale; several items rang up at full price and I had to keep telling her it was on sale.  2) The fabric department is TINY, not even worth driving there for, and the two women working there were arguing with each other and couldn't figure out how to measure fabric correctly, so I just left without buying anything in that department.  3) Most of their items you can get at Michael's or Joann's, and the employees at the other two stores are so much nicer and helpful AND THEY KNOW WHAT'S ON SALE.  4) HL doesn't take competitor's coupons, as do the other stores.  5) They're not open on Sundays.  A lot of people shop on Sundays because Saturdays are usually busy with the kids' games, etc.; and this is the only day to shop.  There are enough craft stores in Las Vegas that are open on Sunday to where I don't need to go out of my way to shop here.  6) But the big thing is the \""nice\"" sign on the door which states that they have the right to 'check your items (as in purse) any time they want, and can check your vehicle', and if you tell them no, they can escort you from the premises/  Really?  Check my vehicle?  I don't think so.  As for escorting people from the premises, they can only escort you as far as the front door,  since they are in a strip mall.  I am not shopping at a store that automatically assumes everyone who comes in the door is a criminal."
0,"SCREW YOU UNITED!!!! More like DIVIDED Airlines.\n\nWorst customer service ever. Hands down. Worst. Not even going to lie.\n\nI purchased tickets to fly from Phoenix to Fort Lauderdale and back. We were leaving May 2nd and returning the 5th. I purchased them through YOUR website at a nominal fee because they were straight through no stops which I thought was pretty epic. $620 a ticket? Straight through? No stops? Pretty bitchin deal I thought.\n\nYou sent me my conformation email giving me the flight numbers, times, insurance info all that happy shit. What you neglected to tell me was that this flight was actually through US Air. \n\nParked at Terminal Two. Traveled FOREVER through Phx to get to your crappy out building somewhere in the BFE section of the airport an hour before my flight. It took 20 minutes to get through the line only for the kiosk, A FUCKING COMPUTER, to tell me that the flight was being run through US Air. A dickhead service guy then bitched and moaned about how WE, my husband and I, fucked up and you were not responsible and directed us to march our happy asses out of your mold infested fly catcher of a terminal and back onto the bus and back to, you guessed it, TERMINAL TWO where US Air was held in the real portion of the airport. \n\nOf course when we got there I was already hyperventilating because our flight was closed and we'd missed it. Lucky for us, and you, US Air is not only amazing, but HUMAN and got us taken care of no problems. Sure... It wasn't the straight through flight landing at 4 pm EST... And I'd have to sit in Charlotte FOREVER... And I wouldn't be landing until 1am EST some  9 hours later and TOTALLY having to pay for that hotel day anyway.\n\nYou people SUCK. Your customer service SUCKS. Talking to the people in your call center SUCKS. Writing a complaint to you and receiving no response other than it's my fault for not realizing that it was a code shared flight even though all of the documentation I have CLEARLY doesn't state that ANYWHERE (even in the fine print. I looked) SUCKS.\n\nThis is one airline that I sincerely hope happens to go the way of the dodo. Worthless."
0,"These were free tickets so that part I loved.\n\nThe show was a little slow. With so much else to do I found it hard to sit and watch semi-awesome things when there was a full size man dressed up as Chucky the doll outside the casino (crazy place!) We left after an hour. Some parts were cool, like the opening scene where she bounced some balls...but seriously after 5 minutes I saw you bounce the balls, I am not amazed anymore! Oh you bounced it off a wall? Not impressed! \n\nToo much other things to do then waste time here. I could see coming to the show if I was really drunk and in Vegas for like 2 weeks and had nothing else to do...."
0,"We used to go to Ike's alllllll the time when we lived in San Jose, and so when my boyfriend and I found this place here in Mesa, we were beyond excited.\n\nBut these sandwiches were DISGUSTING!\n\nYour Dutch Crunch tasted stale and chalky. \nYour meats were dry and pastey.\nAnd your condiments and sauce--which had made you taste so heavenly--were not even in our sandwiches!\n\nWe were soooo disappointed and felt soooo ripped off after eating here. Sorry Ike, we will never eat with you again, the love is gone :("
0,"I first came here thinking I would find some of my favorite stores but the only thing close to somewhere I'd shop is Aeropostale and Old Navy which by the way, always smelled like crap literally as if the sewer busted there. I first asked my hotel desk attendant what I can do in the area that would be fun and memorable, she handed me a Budget rentacar map.  Clue: Get out of town NOW while you still can!!"
0,"First off let me say that up until tonight I was a huge fan of Rubios. I would always order their grilled shrimp tacos or bean and cheese burrito. It always tasted fresh and wasn't greasy. However, tonight I decided to try their new California bowl. I was expecting it to be somewhat similar to Chipolte's burrito bowls. Well . . . the concept was, but in reality it was not even close. The rice was clearly over cooked as it was all mushed together and had no flavor. I assume it is called the California bowl because of the guacamole. However, the amount of guacamole was highly disappointing. Once I mixed all the bowl ingredients together, I couldn't even taste the guacamole which is the best part. I added chicken and again highly disappointed with how much chicken they added. I could barely taste that there was even chicken. Overall, the NEW addition to the menu was a huge disappointment. In the future, Chipolte will be the only place I go for a delicious burrito bowl.\n\nOn a side note, I was also disappointed when Rubio's stopped carrying carnita's. They have two strikes against them in my book."
0,Last time!  It was great to hear the manager yelling and cursing at employees while young kids are in the place!  Don't waste your time.  It didn't feel like the a/c was on.
0,"We waited for 5 minutes with no greeting and were the only people in line to be told they are no longer serving children! Maybe add a sign? We have gone there before with kids. They aren't that busy, doesn't seem like a good choice to turn away business."
1,"So before someone takes away my Phoenician card, I have never been here before.  A girlfriend has been going here for years, was dumbfounded that I had never been, so we bee lined it here. First of all, the owners are from my neck of the woods in PA so insta-love fest. Secondly, warm and welcoming they were so nice to go through the menu and give me samples of the food to help make my decision (which didn't cause everything is so damn good).  I decided on the chicken salad sandwich, TO DIE!!! I MEAN SERIOUSLY!!! It was so damn good.  \n\nI love everything about the place. Next time, cheesesteak sandwiches; he's from Philly and they use real meat not the pre packaged stuff. I'm so stoked. Go here, spend the cash (cash only) support local businesses and fall in love. I did."
1,"This was my first time to a comedy club and I had a blast! \n\nBecause I do not have anything to compare it to, I feel I should give The Comedy Spot 5 stars based on my experience last night. Great staff and a fun intimate setting for a comedy show. \n\nHere's the deal: \n1. You think.... \""Hmm I haven't laughed  or smiled in a awhile, lets go to The Comedy Spot.\"" \n2. Go to the website and print out the coupon online for $2 off admission! (I know what you're thinking...and yes, I am a poor mofo but just do it...why not!) \n3. Get there a bit before your showtime since it is 'first come, first serve' seating and come with a group so you an enjoy a booth unless you are down with sitting up front where the 2 top tables are (These were the people that totally got made fun of by one of the comics). \n4. Sit your ass down...you waitress should get there shortly so order your drink and enjoy the show!"
1,"Awesome and huge store with 4 floors of everything you can think of possible.  Pajamas, clothes, kitchen & cook wear, jewelry, toys, stationary, and of course every type of M&M in every color possible!"
0,"Reasonably priced menu. I was not very impressed with the food or service on my visit. I have been to some of their other restaurants and like it so I decided to give this place a go. Food was very bland; Guacamole had no seasoning.  Asked for some sort of hot sauce when my tacos arrived but their selection was limited; no \""home made\"" hot sauce.  I will try again later and see if they got any of the issues resolved."
1,"The food here is sooo good! They started us off with the basket of crudites, and though I don't really like raw veggies like that too much, it was a cute touch. The olives were good too.\n\nWe ordered the seafood bouchee and fetuccini appetizers and they were both soooo delicious! They give a lot of seafood for an appetizer and both were large dishes! I was starting to get full when they brought out the salmon entree and that was mouthwatering. mMm!\n\nWe ended dinner with the chocolate mousse. Normally I don't like mousse but this one was decadent! It was not overly rich and just tasted so good! I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu here and it's not expensive either. Definitely a must for Vegas! And it's sooooo romantic here, especially in the lovers cove seats :-)"
0,Wish I had read the reviews first. They were busy but obviously can't handle it. Expect what should be an hour dining experience to take 2.5 hours.\n \nThe owner/manager? woman that worked the floor has a defensive attitude and lots of excuses but no time to listen to the customer.\n\nDisappointing. \n\nIn the future I will stick with Zur-Kate German Restaurant in Mesa.
0,"Living near East Side San Jose in California, I have high expectations when it comes to Tortas and Mexican food for that matter. \n\nHowever, I feel that Los Reyes rides on their fame of Man vs Food albiet their torta portions are massive. Nothing here was spectacular to me.\n\nI ordered the Del Rey Torta, from the rave reviews and I do tend to get signature items from restaurants since it should be a representation of who they are. Along with the torta I ordered a horchata.\n\nThe Del Rey is a massive torta that easily feeds 2, a half for each person. It comes with a side of chips and in the torta itself it has: avocado, pickled onions, tomato, egg encasing chorizo, hotdog, then cheese, brisket, and fried steak. Bread barely held every thing in and was a huge mess.\n\nThe torta had lots of textures, flavor wasn't as flavorful and didn't seem to be cohesive. It was just a lot of meat, cooked different ways in between two slices of bread. The chorizo didn't have that lovely red color nor heat to it.\n\nThe horchata was plain chalky, powdering and doused in cinnamon powder on top.\n\nI packed half of my torta home since I couldn't finish my meal, but didn't even end up eating it afterwards. I didn't finish my horchata.\n\nService is decent. Typical of a family run restaurant, casual but timely. Pricing was okay for what it was, though I would get Mexican food elsewhere."
1,Good-ish beer selection and decent food.  Can't complain.
0,I was out in Vegas for a business trip and decided to stay at the palms place since it looked very nice in the pictures and I've read some good reviews about the place.  I stayed in the single bedroom suite. There were a bunch of things broken in my room. To start off one side of the television not working properly and on top of that the wall lamp in that general area had a broken switch. So I had insufficient lighting while i was working and a crappy half working television.  What really got me was the towel.  There was a towel on my rack on the inside fold that had blood stained cover all over it.  This is definitely the last time I will be staying at this place.
1,"Love it! So hard to find great gluten-free pizza! It's was delicious, the seating area was clean and the staff was very friendly. I'll definitely be coming back!"
0,"Quite honestly, this review receives one star only because the food was very good. That concludes the good. Now with the rest:  After being seated, we did receive our chips and salsa (which the salsa and bean dip were very sparse). After approximately 20 minutes and no server was in sight, we asked the busser if she could locate the server. No water, no drinks, no more chips and salsa. Nada. After 10 more minutes the server finally came and took our order. Fajitas for two and kids chicken fingers for our son, and drink orders finally placed as well. 10 minutes later, the dinner salad came out, but still no drinks. We finally received our drinks several minutes later. Service at this location was awful to say the least. \n\nThe server NEVER returned to check on us, refill drinks or anything else. It was as poor service as I have ever experienced. We waited nearly 20 more minutes after we were done with the meal in order to get the check. We asked the busser for to-go boxes, in which she brought one back and literally threw it on the table into the leftovers. That was the final straw. We asked for the manager. When all was explained to him, the manager seemed much less than interested in the issues. He offered no apologies, only dessert.  We asked for the check, and still we waited. Another 5-6 minutes and we had enough. We approached the reception desk and demanded the check at this point. \nI can honestly say this will be the last and only visit to this location."
0,"Eww!  That's all I can say about this meal this evening.  We have never have had a bad meal here, however, tonight was an exception.  What bothered us most was the waiter acted like our complaint was a personal attack against him.  Maybe I should be complaining to the management about the customer service, instead."
0,"Ok- we took a chance on this buffet, and was disappointed.  The only positive experience was with the host staff, who were really nice."
1,The is not a lot of culture in Scottsdale but this is a sure gem.  It is beautiful and there is so much to learn and enjoy from a trip here.  Frank lloyd Wright's work is really fascinating and its fortunate to have this in our backyard to enjoy at any time.
1,First time here was pretty hesitant from reading the reviews but my stay was perfect we stayed on the 26th floor room and restroom was spacious modern and clean overall stay was nice ordered room service took 30 min housekeepers were attentive and punctual everyone was super nice... To top it off it has a awesome location !!\nOnly let down was  the pool nothing impressive compared to other ones
1,Food is good and atmosphere is nice!
1,"I'm a big fan of LUSH. I don't use their products regularly, but I like to pick up a few, or try what's new, whenever I want to spoil myself. I've use their soaps, bath bombs and melts, and lotions (get the charity pot!), and I think I prefer the soaps and lotions -- just as a matter of personal preference, since those tend to last longer than, say, the bombs.\n\nBut *shopping* at LUSH is a whole different matter for me. Every time I go in there, I feel bombarded by the salespeople! Browsing beauty products should be fun and relaxing ... I just want to explore and see what they've gotten in that's new, etc., but instead I have a girl popping up in front of me every five minutes shoving different products in my face or grabbing my hands to smear them on me. All right already! I will buy something! I promise! Just let me find it on my own!"
1,Matt the technician was helpful and knowledgable...  They are also installing a new unit for my house and I will update this post once complete.
0,I've had 2 good experiences here before. However I don't know if I can go back after today. I asked for a simple French manicure which I've had in the past many a time but today she just couldn't get it right. The filing job was horrible (very rough) and the polish application was sloppy containing lumps and bubbles. I had her remove it and I was going to do a solid color until I noticed that she had filed so deeply into the bed of one of my nails I almost have skin coming through it. She didn't even remove all of the polish from my cuticles. I was happy to pay for the removal of the previous gel however was charged for a manicure. A manicure that I could have done much better myself. I had to ask for lotion! -Which quickly and half-hazzardly applied to my arms and wrists. No Cuticle oil or lotion to my hands And certainly not to my nail beds. They were just going to leave them dry.
0,"This review is mostly for my pharmacy experience not the retail store. So I will start by saying the gentleman cashiers watching me hobble in in crutches and a hospital bracelet at 5am were funny, pleasant, and thoughtful considering the circumstances! But hey it's a CVS so pharmacy is the main contender here. And I've had lovely experiences elsewhere where I've been treated with proper urgency and respect. \nSo I haven't filled at this location before but it's the closest 24 hour store. I originally tried to drive through at 11pm with a prescription from my late urgent care trip, my painful injury was worsening quickly and I NEEDED it. I hand it over and the overnight pharmacist says \""ha. good luck finding this.\"" \""Why, what is it?\"" \""Pain medication.\"" \""Well yes. what's wrong, what do I do?\"" \""Other pharmacies probably won't have it.\"" \""Ok.......should I call around for it? What's wrong with it?\"" \""No pharmacies open, better in the day when they're open.\"" Ok, So thanks for nothing, I drove away in tears and I had to google to find out that the provider wrote me a prescription for a dosage that was totally discontinued. So injury was aggravated and got worse and worse and worse so long irrelevant story short I was in the ER all night getting proper care and had a different CORRECT prescription written for me. So I dropped off at same CVS and he ended up grilling me with irrelevant questions I've NEVER been asked before, which I can only chalk up to him thinking I am a drug addict or faking an identity. The exhausted, sick, newly casted, begrudgingly on crutches me was pissed and asked why he was asking questions and how it was relevant to which I got no reply. So, thank you sketchy neighborhood for making any normal person in pain look like they have an addiction problem and making this gentleman pharmacist make my night even more hellish! And sorry I have tattoos and feel terribly discriminated against as well. Never again."
0,Had the taste of Italy. The Chicken Parmigiana and Lasagna was overcooked. The Fettuccine Alfredo was OK except that all the red sauce from the other two items bleed all other the plate and ruined the taste. Bread sticks and salad were good.
0,Great selection on beers!!! Too bad I can't say the same for the service or the food.
0,"So I walked into this place to try and eat lunch around 1:30 without to much success. When I walked in there was 1 person in the place and he was actually just breaking some chicken at the time. So I'm like ok it's a hole in the wall it's fine I can wait a min. So I ask where do I order from to let him know I was wanting to order something. Proceeded to say it's my 1st time in. He says \"" there is a menu in the front\"" \n\nThese were actually the last words that were spoken between us. After he washed his hands I expected to have my order taken but I guess this guy had better things to do than actually sell something. So I wait like 10 minutes playing with my phone and finally I'd had enough and just walked back out the door and went to Twin Peeks and got a burger. \nI guess I won't be back here anytime soon thanks a lot Z Chicken. \nI really think the guy just wanted me to leave he didn't even say a word as I walked out \nI don't think Z chicken is gonna make it with service like this"
1,"Went to happy hour after having gone there a few years ago and thought it was too expensive.  But the beauty of happy hour is that is reasonable.  We bought 3 dishes and only needed 2.  Whereas most places charge you $5 for some appretizer, it's usually small so you wind up buying more.  The Salt and Pepper Shrimp came with several large shrimp and was excellent!  The Pan Seared Tuna was also excellent.  Nice atmosphere, older crowd, great drinks, excellent wait staff, etc.  We'll be back."
0,"The place had this awful smell to it, wasn't sure what it was but smelled something like dirty clothes that have been wet a few day. The prices are high at most the vendors stands that I went to. There is no food that I seen so if your hungry this isn't the place to come. Once you smell the inside you will most likely lose your appetite anyway. The management is rude, and dont speak much english or any spanish. When asked a question they simply ignore you or say the don't understand. I will not be returning, because there was nothing that was of any use to me. I will stick to the Arizona Mills good prices and A/C, something the indoor swap meet didn't have running."
0,"Perhaps my view of this show is tainted by the other Cirque shows I've seen.\n\n1. There is no theme. IMO kind of dum to have birds (a rooster), a baby, a snail, and other whatever-else-they-are.  This is applicable, because most Cirque shows have a theme or some semblance thereof.\n\n2. There is very little substance.  I'll give credit to the artists, but I can only pick out 3 things worth clapping for -- the 2 strongmen (absolutely amazing), the teeter-totter people (repetitive), and the trapeze artists (really repetitive.. not even a jump from one side to the other).  Otherwise, the time was filled with interpretive dance, a drum finale, and other acts that were either gimmicks or just not dazzling.  Get new choreographers.\n\n3. Lot of gimmicks for no reason.  The baby, the old usher, the moving stage (what was the purpose of that-- during a set it would go up and down for what reason?  Other times I know it was to allow the artists to exit, but really...), the snail, etc.  Perhaps kids would like it, perhaps not.\n\n4. The cost.  If it weren't for discounted tickets for staying at Treasure Island, I hardly think this was worth the cost.  I am not recommending this show to friends.\n\nOther shows worth seeing instead: Ka (non-gimmicky use of the set), \""O\"", Zumanity (adult humor, topless girls, some gay themes), Blue Man Show, Ovo (not currently in Vegas), etc."
0,"We had a REALLY bad experience with one of the managers at the Front Desk of the Venetian during our stay.  I think his name was Chris and he is short, stubby, blond  with a cul da sac hairline.  We went to him to complain about how we were misinformed about the the pool time hours at the Venezia.  We walked all the way from the Palazzo where we were staying, to the Venezia as we were told their pool was to open until 10PM.  Because it rained that day, we even double checked to make sure that the pool was still open.  We were told it was.  So my friends and I made a very long trek over to the Venezia.  When we shared our complaint to this Chris guy, he was rude to us, did not apologize for us being misinformed.  He made it seem like it was our fault for walking there in the first place.  He even said, \""I can't believe you all walked all the way here.  No one ever walks from the Palazzo to the Venezia.\""   Well apparently, dumb ass, people do.  He then said, \""well I am not going to do anything for you.\""  I then told him that the front desk associate  who helped us first said that she would comp us with $25 dollar in room credit in addition to the late check out.  He gave that associate a bad look, and said to her, \""Did you say that???!\""  Really rude!  His attitude was appalling.  I can't believe this guy works in customer service, because his customer service skills suck!  The Venetian needs to hire people who will better represent them.   I have never had a bad experience with the Venetian until I came across this douche bag."
1,"I had a cracking meal here on Saturday night and would definitely recommend this place. The only other sushi place I've visited in Edinburgh is Bonsai, but I prefer this place for cost and ambiance. I'm no Japanese food expert but I really enjoyed my meal here. \n\nI have this preconceived notion that Japanese food will never fill me up and I therefore need to order tonnes of it. Not the case at No1; I ordered waaaay too much food and couldn't finish it all. There are loads and loads of menu options so we were spoilt for choice. \n\nWe went for starters of deep-fried bean curd and Japanese dumplings (the dumplings were brilliant), followed by a traditional ramen for me and teriaki chicken for the bloke, supplemented by 6 avocado rolls and 6 salmon rolls. That's a lot of food for two people and it was very tasty. Although it was great, we couldn't finish it all and I will know better for next time. Portion sizes are ample so there's no need to go crazy with the menu.  \n\nStaff were very friendly and helpful. We were even given a free bowl of ice cream to share because we had to move table (someone accidentally sat us at a pre-booked seat). \n\nThe place was very busy when we rolled up, and all the food I saw looked colourful and delicious. You could also watch some of the chefs rolling the sushi, which kept me fixated for some time. Two thumbs up. Will definitely be back."
1,"i've been here waaaaaaaay too many times over the numerous trips to vegas...  \n\ni'm not sure what meal is best: \n\n- the 8am saturday or sunday morning, where the previous nights clubbers are slowly melting and whithering away in the booths, with only a handful of other partiers that are GACKED out of their minds from doing rails in the bathroom... trying to push down the $4.99 steak &egg special\n\n- the usual breakfast crowd where you see everyone in their best make-up, or hipster wear, ready to hit the pool?\n\n- the i-need-to-eat-something-if-i'm-gonna-keep-drinking-or-else-i'm-gonna-hurl-too-soon \n\n- or the ones that just got out of Vanity (which before was Body English [which before was BABY's]) and cram into Lucky's, trying to get a bite to soak up all the alcohol they just induced...\n\ni'm proud to say that i've been to each of these meals (minus the nose candy)... and there was something on that menu for each occasion.  the standards like club sammie, steak & eggs, burger & fries, are all on there, as well as a couple other items like chicken & waffles and meatloaf - these last 2 were shot down by the waiter at my last sitting this weekend. \n\n\""casino diner's are good for their standards... not meatloaf or chicken & waflles...\n\ni will always come back here.  i like it.  and it's saved me from a ton of hangovers.."
1,"The Palazzo is a charming hotel, just like her sister, The Venetian. I've stayed here many times since one of my girl friends gets free rooms all the time because her family gambles here a lot. This used to be my favorite hotel in terms of decor, but now the competition is stiff between Encore, Aria and Cosmo. I love the layout of the suite here. 2 queen beds and a living room with a sofa sleeper. 7 can sleep here pretty comfortably. \n\nFrom what I can remember, sleeping on the bed is like sleeping on a cloud. I've probably contemplated not going out and just staying in bed because it was really that comfortable. This room is beyond luxurious and the hotel is a great place to stay since it's right next to Wynn, Venetian and TI. \n\nThe Grand Lux Cafe is open 24 hours too. If you love The Cheesecake Factory, then you'll love the Grand Lux too!"
0,"We enrolled my son here for the preschool program with the hope to have him learn with some structure to his classroom and expose him to social interaction with his peers. He attended this \""school\"" for the entire  year only so that we did not disrupt his experience. We are so glad to not be returning. The teachers at the school are caring and sweet, but I think the teacher-student ratio is too high for what I am paying for this place. They are not able to give each child adequate attention for this young age. \n\nAlso, the front desk is extremely unfriendly and one woman in particular has a very sour attitude all the time. My biggest complaint is they are inconsistent with discipline. If my child has a tantrum (common at this age), they are quick to call us to pick him up and do not credit you for the day. However, there is a child in class who has bitten other children several times and the only thing the school does is call both parents ( the biter child and the bitten child) to \""document\"" it for their records. I find this unacceptable! If this is repeated behavior for this bully child and the parents cannot curtail their kid, the child should be expelled or suspended. The school has done very little other than covering their own butt. My child is not having a good experience at your school if he is being bitten every other time he attends class. While I understand kids will be kids, the school cannot be so passive. This is a private school and one child should not be habitually jeopardizing the safety of the others.\n\nIn addition, their program advertises a structured curriculum, but I did not feel they stuck to this well. My son does not even start and end in the same classroom with the same kids each day, nor does he have the same teacher for the day. They switch off based on their own schedules. How does this create structure for a child?  They claim they will encourage a potty training environment, but I saw no evidence of this all year. \n\nIn summary, we tried to be patient and to talk to the director about our concerns, but in the end our experience was very disappointing. I definitely do not classify this as a school, more like an overpriced daycare. Would not recommend this place to anyone, unless you are okay gambling with your child's safety and well-being."
0,"I am new to Charlotte and couldn't get an appointment with a primary care physician for a few weeks so urgent care was my only option. I do not have any complaints about the appointment itself, however the follow up care at this establishment is atrocious. As someone who works in the medical field, I am familiar with how a doctor's office is run. My pharmacy and myself have called Concentra a total of 9 times and have yet to receive a straight answer nor a call back (going on 7 days now). Once I went 5 days past my refill date, I ended up just solving the problem myself. After calling the third time I also had to deal with several rude nurses, which I did not appreciate being as they were lacking the ability to do their job. I've never dealt with such a poorly run and unorganized medical office before. I wouldn't be surprised if many patients fell threw the cracks here. This place is in desperate need of organization, follow through and an attitude adjustment."
0,"Horrible reservations process! I called the Ceasars reservations line and was offered a time, the agent patched me thru to the restaurant phone which NEVER picked up. I called the reservation line again and was then given a direct number for the restaurant which still never picked up. On my 3rd call to the reservation line, all the 8 available slots for the day I wanted were gone in a matter of 10 minutes time. On my final call to book a reserv for my birthday, the agent was able to book the spot directly....are u kidding me?!? Why didn't they do that in the first place for the time and date I wanted? Ridiculous system. Not a way to encourage repeat local patrons to return to your property!"
1,"I have been to Voulez Vous a handful of times over the past 2 years. I like it because it's close to my house, and the staff are usually quite friendly/funny! I feel that they do a decent job, and the prices are fair. My reason for knocking off a star is that some of the techs are very persistent about trying to sell you more services. I totally get that it's part of their job and usually don't mind, but last time I went I actually became a little offended. The nail tech kept insisting on a brow wax; I explained to her that I had just had one at my hair salon 5 days prior. She actually acted like she didn't believe me and asked where! This was 3 days before my wedding, so you can be assured my brows looked great. I keep them a little bit on the thicker side because I don't want to be a middle aged woman with no eyebrows in 20 years due to over waxing and plucking.\n\nSo... word of advice, I would recommend NOT letting them wax your brows, because you're going to risk walking out looking ridiculous with extremely thin, tiny eyebrows :-)\n\nI will still go back and get my nails done there, however."
0,"I am a high traffic traveler.  I am at Sky Harbor once or twice a week.  I know every restaurant option and even the servers and TSA agents because of my frequency.  If you are eating in the \""high A\"" terminal (gates 20+), this is really your only sit down option.  It's OK food, but the breakfast sucks.   \n\nThere are a couple of issues I have with this restaurant.  1) When you sit down and order, they want you to pay in advance.  I ordered a food and drink and they asked to run my credit card.  That's just bad form.  We're in an airport.  If people are stiffing you, hire more people or people who are more attentive.  2) At the food prep station, next to the kitchen, there appears to be a large amount of bored employees chatting it up.  They are loud and obnoxious.  No one really cares to hear about their prior night's excursion - all while I have an Ice Tea with no sweetener (how hard is it to bring sweetener with tea?), or when my food comes, no one bothered to give me my set up.  Why don't they all just STFU and focus on the customer? How about using some of those people to watch out for the dine-n-dash people, so you don't run my credit card when I sit down?  3) The food is just unremarkable, considering the way Sky Harbor has stepped up the food options with Sauce, Chelsea's Kitchen and the like.  \nThis joint is way better than Cinnabon or Burger King, but it still falls to the bottom.  I would rather have Blue Burrito back, which this place took over.  \n\n If you're there for breakfast, I have tried them all and they really aren't good.  My breakfast item comes from the \""all day\"" menu. Ask for the quesadilla with ground beef and cheese.  Also ask for extra salsa, since they restrict how much salsa they give out.  They provide you one little plastic side cup, that's only filled  1/2 way. The quesadilla will be a little greasy with the cheese/meat, but it's edible and tastes good. \nI like Cowboy Ciao but you need to walk all the way over to B terminal.  A terminal has Blanco Tacos.  If you're at Sky Harbor early enough, it's worth the walk for either of these options, and the walk will do you good to and fro!"
1,Great service and really good food.
0,I will never step foot in this establishment again. This is my 3rd time here and the service has yet to improve. Waiter/Waitresses are continuously very cold not personable. Moving on the food was below average ( chicken fajita  - blackened tuna salad) tuna was over cooked and the fajita  was thrown together! The waiter could obviously notice the tuna was not prepared as we requested however failed to ever ask if we enjoyed our dish. We feared speaking up about the matter due to the poor service and chances of food contamination.
1,"Love this spot great, fresh food! Bourbon chicken is the best!! Egg drop soup is also super yummy!"
1,"This is nice spot for those who likes almost authentic Thai-Malaysian food. We ordered 2 dishes - nasi lemak and hainan chicken rice. Nasi lemak came with chicken curry, taste authentic while being not spicy even for Americans here. Hainan chicken rice is an ok, preferred Penang Malaysian Restaurant better though.\n\nThe decor is nice with a decent bar for those who likes to sit on the bench."
0,"The food was over 20 minutes late, cold and subpar. They get 2 stars for being cheap. Will not order again with so many other places to choose from. Plenty of mixed reviews so this place must be hit or miss. It was a miss for me."
0,"Are you a douche bag?  Do you have more money than sense?  Does it make you all warm and fuzzy to way overpay for a mediocre drink?  If so, Majerle's is the place for you!  \n\nPersonally, I never cared for the \""owner\"" when he was with the Suns, and this establishment has done nothing to change that opinion.  The food is bland at best, but for the prices it should have a little flavor.  I'm not sure what criteria the staff uses when deciding who to grace with their presence, but the female servers sure weren't responding to me (a woman) even when I held out a $20.00 - my 6'3\"" friend had much better luck, he was the one that had to order my drink.  \n\nI'm disappointed, this is such an easy place to hit on a light rail pub crawl or before or after a game or concert, but I just don't think I can bring myself to go back willingly."
1,Excellent Service and everyone in the store is awesome.  I was helped by a guy around my age(I think his name was Damon) and he was really helpful.  He gave me a great deal on the tires and changed them in record time!
1,"Order the BBQ Pork, and as soon as I checked in at the location I got a free glass of champagne....allready off to good start"
0,"Such a disappointment. I really don't understand what the fuss is all about. I probably ate there on a bad night...but $50 was really not worth it. The only 3 things I was happy with were, the papaya salad, the teriyaki chicken, and the banana macaroon. I could eat that anywhere and still be satisfied for much cheaper."
1,"Great mom n pop shop. Fresh ingredients, fresh food, great prices, good variety and daily specials. Only complaint would be when they run out of homemade French fries they serve frozen store bought crap with no notice... Other than that a real gem."
1,I like this radio station because they play a bunch of Old School songs from the 80's & 90's and mix it in with some newer stuff.  Very mainstream though.  It's always a fun station to listen to.
1,"im almost sad that i found this place, because now i have a difficult time choosing between this place and the old fashioned when i visit madison... \n\nall of the food that i put into my mouth here was great. i also had a good amount of great beer so i dont fully remember what all the food was that i put into my mouth... just trust that its all good. \n\ni was equally as impressed with the beer though, if not more. they brew all their own beer, at least from what i remember. i am a pretty harsh judge of beer, just ask the horny goat, this place does it right. it was clear that they actually care about the quality of the beer they put out, which is sometimes not the case with gastropub sort of places.\n\nbasically id definitely recommend trying this place out. youll be happy you did."
0,Disappointing! I believe the earlier reviews nailed it......cheap frozen food cooked without any type of sauce or spiffing up included. Bland and overpriced so you better come for the TVs. Our waitress was efficient and timely. I hope she is keeping her options open because I can't see this lasting in C-U. There are too many tasty options available.
1,"Had Valentines dinner there and it was great! The vegan options were delicious, the service was great and the atmosphere was great too! The only thing was that the music was a little too loud. It's not a place to have a relaxing dinner."
0,"I wish zero stars were an option. I placed a delivery order and was told it would take 30-45 minutes to arrive. After waiting for 90 minutes and placing three calls to the store, my food arrived. When opening the bag, I had a feeling this food wasn't worth the wait. My beef/broccoli was chewy, cold, and unappetizing. I ate a few bites and tossed most of it in the trash. Do not eat at place and whatever you do, don't get their takeout service. Go to Tapei Express on Providence for great Chinese takeout."
0,"The theme of today's Yelp is: Know Thyself.\n\nKnow thyself, filibertos.  Here's what you aren't: Houston's.  I don't need an open kitchen and I certainly don't need to wait for thirty minutes to get my burrito.\n\nKnow thyself: you aren't so busy that you need to give out numbers and then call out the orders by their numbers only.  Hey, lady: no one wants the receipt.  We throw it away once you hand it to us.  We earnestly wish you never gave it to us in the first place.  So no, we don't remember the number.  We don't understand why you're so annoyed that no one is responding to you when you call out some number.  I ordered a sausage burrito, not a 1473, so I don't know why you're yelling out numbers and looking huffy.\n\nFurthermore, give us some visual cue: for example, if you ask me if I want it for here or to go, and I choose \""for here,\"" I won't think that a burrito in a paper bag is mine, no matter what number you're calling.\n\nKnow thyself: at every other Filibertos, the food *is* the entertainment.  We go there to drown in a bliss that can only be made up of butter/greasy butter substitute and delightfulness.  Not for the TVs.  And when you have two TVs next to each other, you don't need the volume on for both.  Because this creates, at best, an Echo Effect.  This effect makes whoever is talking sound like God in some deus ex machina stage presentation.  Which is terrifying when it's the voice of Bill Austin on Beth and Bill.  I can only assume I have kicked one too many innocent dogs (I never kick dogs) and I am roasting in hell.  I would now like to trade in the eternity of Beth and Bill for an eternity of sixth degree burns, please.\n\nHere is the quintessential failure of this Filibertos: the food is shit.  The green sauce has the consistency of applesauce--a fact which makes me want to puke.  The burrito was filled with what can only be fake eggs, and tons of them.  Not much in the way of sausage and I'm pretty sure it was made of something that used to be someone's pet.  And the river of cheese on the side had coagulated.  Worst of all, the nefarious garlic monster has once again shat in my mouth and I now see plants wilting in my wake.\n\nDon't ever go to this place.  Use your mighty dollar vote and go elsewhere.  Because all the good that Filibertos has done in this world is under threat by this fucking impostor.\n\n--------\n\nMy wife read the review, and by \""read\"" I mean listened while I read it to her, and she fears I might be giving all Filibertos a bad name.  No.  Only this one sucks.  She says you should go to the one on McQueen and Pecos, and she is, as usual, right."
1,"I'm not particularly interested in vegetarian restaurants. Now that I've tried FERN, I've changed my tune a bit. I found the food there quite interesting and inventive. Was here with my 7 year old daughter and my sister for a Sunday Brunch. I had the Zucchini and Spinach Benedict. I'm a big guy and I love meat, but this dish was very filling. Felt very full but not stuffed like I needed a nap after eating here. Decor was cool. We liked the touches of the mason jar lighting. My only gripe was waitress was a little weird, not very attentive, and the seating just felt really open like I was sitting with the table next to us.  I'll be back again."
0,i have been to this mac probley 6 times in a 5 year peroid and have gotten food poisening twice the latest boute 2 days ago on a cheese burger this location needs to be reported to the health inspectors. eat here knowing you have a good chance of being poisened
0,"Well where should I start?  I made the reservation on open table about a month ago and was looking forward to this dinner immensely.  I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and we ate at Burgur the day prior.  We had a 7:30 res and arrived on time. We were asked to go to the lounge and wait for our table as it wasn't ready yet. At 8 pm I approached \""Erica\"" the hostess and asked if she knew how long it will be until the table was ready, she answered very abruptly and rudely saying they will come and get us when it's ready. There was no explanation and no apology, just attitude.  We were taken to our table shortly after by another hostess who was great. I also was disappointed with the music level, it was so loud that it was hard to enjoy the dinner, it had a very club like atmosphere that took away from fine dinning.  Our waiter Tony was great and very helpful as well and Andrew and Krystal who helped out with a few question and service. It is also disappointing that you cannot get a 6 oz steak, not everyone can eat 10 plus oz's of meat. On a less important point but noteworthy we were not offered regular water, bottled or sparkling only, just something that lessened the experience.  At the end of the evening and a $400 bill the evening was enjoyable but disappointing."
1,"I would say 3.5 stars, but service was prompt and attentive so I'll round it up to 4.\n\nRolls were huge and cheaper than other places. Fish was fresh, spicy tuna was soooo good. I've been twice and there was something \""off\"" to me, the second time I realized it was the sushi rice. Its bland tasting to me.\n\nI want to go back to try the curry dishes."
0,I was a patient for a little over 2 years.  I would visit him when I had muscle trouble or other various pains from my strenuous job.  My past experience has been mediocre at best.  Never when I visited has my pain been completely relieved.  Often I just feel temporary relief and some comfort and then the pain returns.  \n\nMy last visit became a nightmare.  I visited regarding severe rib pain.  He rushed me in and out of the office with a referral to get xrays done and a prescription of ibuprofen and a low dose pain killer.  (Due to scheduling conflicts and an upcoming vacation I was unable to rush in to the xray center)  As time progressed my pain got worse after my visit and the prescriptions did nothing to take the edge off the pain.  I called to tell them about the ineffectiveness of the prescription and was told there was nothing... repeat nothing further they could do for me until I got the xrays even after I explained I would not be able to get xrays until after my vacation in 2 weeks.  \n\nFrustrated I requested a refund due to the fact that the treatment was incomplete and ineffective and they refused.  Apparently they feel comfortable charging for mediocre service.
0,"I've been to Pomegranate several times over the past few years since it has been open. I'm always trying to give this place yet another chance because I genuinely want it to get better but it unfortunately never does. On every occasion that I've been here the customer service is beyond terrible. It's generally the same staff working, including the owners, and every time they've been rude, unpleasant, and unhelpful to a point where I feel extremely uncomfortable. The reason I've tried giving this restaurant more than one chance to redeem itself is because of the quality of the meals and ingredients that are used on the menu. The problem? It's overpriced. I understand they're using great ingredients, but I do all of my grocery and dining at places that have the same exact high quality standards that don't cost nearly as much as Pomegranate does. Some of the items I have bought were decent but I've had a few meals from them that made me sick immediately after. I love the idea behind Pomegranate so I hope that over time they can improve their menu, prices, and customer service skills."
0,"Out of all the pizza places in DTLV, I decided on Pop Up for our office lunch because of it's 4.5 star rating and the fact that they deliver when Papa Johns doesn't.\n\nOur order ($53): \n\n2 pizzas\nHouse Salad with ranch instead of Italian\n4 extra ranch (charged extra for each)\n\nOur order took an hour and 15 minutes to get to us, even though the Plaza is only 3 blocks away from our office. I probably could have walked to pick it up quicker than it was delivered. The pizza was...luke warm and the crust was very tough to bite through. It didn't taste awful, but it's not as good as the reviews made it out to be. The salad? It was tossed in Italian dressing and didn't even include any ranch on the side. And speaking of ranch dressing, we only got 3 out of the 4 we ordered!\n\nThe quality of food, lack of attention to our order and time it took to have it delivered were very disappointing. Definitely won't be ordering from here again."
0,"Overall not impressed, the food is not all that great and the atmosphere treats itself bigger than it should. Pork dim sum was bland and the $16 flank steak noodles were drenched in salt ... At the very least the staff was extremely nice and I hear the tofu dim sum was decent... Just not my place I guess"
1,I hadn't been back after my last visit because I was not happy with their service. Came here at lunch today and the service is a million times better! Food here is always good so I will start frequenting this place a lot more.
0,"The patio has a nice vibe and we were seated. Craft beer and extensive wine list was yum. The menu though..really needs work.  Beet salad. fried veggies and calamari, salmon with lentils, chicken ala boring. The menu was just so...limited.  If we were not famished we would have looked for another place, but the valet had already parked us.  Complimentary valet service was nice. I ordered a vegetarian black bean burger. It came with fries, but I substituted for fruit. The fruit bowl was huge, but the fruit was day-old melon.  My friend had a boring chicken sandwich. Grilled and tossed across a bun..just blah.  We were confused on wait staff-who was serving us? Three people came by. They were confused with fetching a little ketchup for me to try and spice up the bean burger.  The bean burger was dry and arrived with no sauce or toppings except lettuce and tomato.  We ate just to eat,  tipped and were left with a feeling..nice place for a nice drink and a chat if you are near The Westin, but other than that...prepare to be bored."
1,"Although this place is tiny and the line may be long, it is worth the cramped wait. Maybe it was just so satisfying because I was starving after walking the strip, but I thought their chili cheese dog was amazing. Sure its just your regular long hot dog with toppings, but for some reason it just hit the spot in the perfect way. I thought it was super fresh, the chili was perfect and the cheese was nicely melted and gooey. I left the mustard off.. that didn't sound appealing but all in all I enjoyed the food and eating on their little patio in the sunshine."
0,"Don't go.  Don't go especially if you are part of a convention.  It was gross all around.  The rooms were surprisingly nice, well the renovated ones.  I would go elsewhere."
1,"Holy pancake orgasm, Batman!  \n\nThe richest. smoothest. buttery-est, fullest, fluffiest, tastiest cooked-to-perfection pancakes you'll ever eat. Those of us who haven't had the pleasure of dining at Matt's thought we knew a good pancake... WRONG!  Matt's is where it's at, 1/2 hr-1 hr wait and all (We were seated in 1/2hr Tuesday @ 10am).  \n\nThe restaurant is very busy, so one cannot expect the servers to build rapport with the customer.  Rather it's more important they keep my coffee and OJ full with a smile, which they did well.\n\nI had the ribeye, eggs and home fries, which was one of the specials of the day.  While my steak was cooked medium when I requested medium-rare, it was delicious, well cooked and seasoned to perfection.  \nEggs over easy done text-book as well, fresh, hot and you can't get any better.\n\nThe portions on most of the orders seemed small, so we had to order some sides which drove up the bill total.  The menu can be inexpensive if you just order one thing, but there are so many great things to try!.. like the fresh strawberry preserves!\n\nHands down this is best breakfast gem in Arizona and I can't wait until we can go back!"
1,I had a great time here last week. The room was new and clean.They have places to eat and good slots. Dont get the smoking if you cant handle strong ass second hand smoke . I think I stood in room 2053. Its not haunted. Super cold AC.
1,"This place is great, if you want healthy mexican food and great service, you need to stop in here!\n\nIve had the Big Blue, which is huge, great if you dont have to do anything in the afternoon. I usally eat the Twice Grilled Chicken Salad, healthy portion of food.\n\nThey also have a self serve salsa bar, with hot and mild sauce and plenty of chips.\n\nAlso have a drive up curb side service, kind of like Sonic, where they bring the food out to you after a phone order. \n\nMake sure you use the punch card, 6 punches and you get $5 off your next entree. Double punches on Monday all day and Tues nights."
1,"switch really impressed me the first time i went there for the yelp elite event. i decided to check it out on my own, and a friend and i came for happy hour one evening because she had a gift certificate here.\n\nwe sat out on their patio, which is kind of odd, because it's like half tables/half patio lounge-ish, and it's located at the \""front\"" (well technically the back) of the restaurant so everyone has to walk through said patio area (which is rather narrow) to get into the restaurant. so you really don't have a cool view of anything from their patio, besides the people walking in. yawn.\n\nanyways, they have these daily, ALL DAY LONG, $1.99 DRINK and FOOD specials. the waitress gave me a card listing them and what they are on certain days. i won't bore you with them all (Call and ask) but on saturday night when we went it was $1.99 COSMOS in 3 flavors and half off specialty drinks and drunk italian sodas because of the 4-6:30 happy hour. what a STEAL!!!!! if you are looking for a place to drink and eat before you start out your crazy evening, switch definitely would be my recommendation.  i got this mojito like drink that was HUGE and refreshingly delicious and only like $3. and 2 cosmos for $4. that's 3 PREMIUM drinks for $7 folks. unbeatable.\n\nthe food is amazing as well. there is something for everyone on their menu. i went for the mozzarella caprese, because i had tried a sample of it at the yelp event and dreamt about it nearly every night thereafter. it came with a cesar salad on the side, and i just want to say thank you switch for not feeding me fattening greasy fries and filling me up on the crisp, refreshing, deliciousness of a simple cesar salad. the sandwich...mind blowing. even better than i remember it. seriously. the best. mozzarella and tomato sandwich. around. i don't even want to try anything else on the menu ever, because i am so in love with this sandwich. i would have never thought a vegatarian option, let alone something that basic could leave my palette, my stomach, and my mind so completely satisfied.\n\nmozzarella caprese, will you marry me? better yet, can i just rest my head in your delicate mozzarella, lettuce, and tomato bed?"
0,"I brought my son and couple of his friends here after for the first time after a movie. When I first walked in I must say it was an impressive sight. Lots of redemption games and the familiar cluster of noises reminded me of that an arcade is supposed to be. \n\nBut my son and his friends were more interested in the e-sports room, particularly in Mario Kart on the Wii U. When we found out they hold Mario Kart tournaments he was super excited. But concerned parents BEWARE!!!!!! These events along with many others are hosted by an outside person. So like any responsible parent I did a little research on this person who I will leave anonymous. Although I have had no interactions with this person personally, based on some of the vulgarity he posts on Twitter and watching some of his videos, I do not know how a large company like GameWorks could associate with such a person. He is not only unprofessional on his social media but also has no concern for censoring himself around younger people during hosted events it seems. My son was disappointed when I told him he could not attend any of these events but I feel it's my responsibility as a parent is to not allow him to come to these events based on the personality involved. Perhaps these events are geared more for \""adults\"" then it shouldn't be kid games or GameWorks should do a little more research on who they have working for them."
1,"I stopped in to Zzeek's on the way home from work and I'm glad I stopped! The customer service was absolutely top notch. Followed up with some extremely good pizza and zzepolis(not sure what they are, but WOW!!!!) Barro's USED to be my favorite pizza parlor in the PHX valley but it has recently changed to Zzeek's. This place is a true mom and pop shop and is very hands on and extremely friendly and customer service driven. Thanks for the awesome food!"
1,"One would really never have to leave the hotel if they didn't want to.  Everything you could want is in this place.  The atmosphere is always great 24/7.  Holsteins is a great place to grab lunch, great drinks and fun servers.  The Henry was outstanding and the price was even better.  I've paid more at Chili's for crappy food.  I've already done a review for STK and we will be back.  I really didn't think I'd be staying anywhere but the Aria after last summer but Cosmo beats it pretty easily.  How awesome is that shower?  Everything about the rooms was great."
0,"Quick review, as others have stated the pizza is small.  One pizza per person at best.  I ordered the cheese pizza and a sausage pizza.  It took approximately 40 minutes to get our order and they didn't even look that busy.  Sodas are $4 a piece and never even got a chance to get a refill.  Our waitress came by maybe 1 time after getting our food.  As for the food quality itself, I have had better out of a Smith's frozen pizza.  Definitely will NOT be coming back here.  Other than the great atmosphere, I don't see this place lasting."
1,"We had a great time here.  We were walking back from the Wynn to our hotel and we stopped in here.  I was actually looking for Coca-Cola socks but we were exhausted and thirsty so we went up to the soda counter.  The guy behind the counter was great.  We got our coke in a bottle and sat there for a few minutes.  The guy behind the counter started talking to these girls who were from Taiwan and started to speaking to her in Taiwan.  And he even sang for her.  He was just great.  He made that store.  If you're in town and need a place to stop before you go gamble some more, stop in the Coke store, it's fun."
0,"This is the second time I visited this restaurant. The first time I bought a burger but didn't taste too good so I thought I'd give it a second try. I walked in there with one other person and looked at the menu. I waited for about five minutes while the cashier and cooks all stared at me. I took my wallet out in attempt to let them know I would like to order some food from establishment. Cashier that would have taken my order continue to count her cash as the cooks continued to stare at nine. I then placed my wallet back in my rear pocket and did an about face. I exited the restaurant with no problem. Nobody tried to stop me and ask me, hey would you like to order some food? As I stated before this was my second visit to this restaurant, it will also be my last. I also feel like I was racially profiled."
1,"So I went to last night and thought I should try something different, I asked my server, Kristina, what was a good appetizer and she suggested the hot wok tiger shrimp. When the plate came I could already tell it was spicy just by the view, I took a bite and it was heaven! The shrimp was juicy, the sauce was spicy, and the onions and avocado gave it a fresh clean taste. I loved it! If you like spicy shrimp this is definitely worth a try! \nSN: I love the atmosphere and servers there, definitely one of my favorite places in Charlotte!"
1,"Excellent Food, Excellent Sevice even with 11 people in our party. Lovely place for breakfast."
1,"I went again for dinner. I enjoyed my local-fruit cocktail, veggie burger, and the deviled eggs. (However, why does somewhere like this -- that seems like an innovative place that loves it veggies, only have a veggie burger as an option? Oh wow, haven't seen THAT before) Waitress was nice. The atmosphere is still pretty spectacular."
0,"I've eaten here twice since I came to the Hard Rock, and I regret it. I can understand the appeal of the food if you're American (sorry?) but as a vancouverite, my standards for what I will eat are apparently higher than this restaurant can accommodate. \n\nThe first time I ordered the Heuvos rancheros, which came in a skillet and was probably the wettest meal I've ever eaten in my life. I took about six bites before I felt like I was going to projectile all over myself. \n\nThe second time I ordered hashbrowns and turkey bacon, which was surprisingly ok. \n\nI guess my bottom line here is that unless you're desperate you should go anywhere else. Seriously."
1,"As long as you don't try and go on a holiday (the line is atrocious) this is actually one of the better buffets for locals in Vegas. The place is clean, the wait staff is understaffed but they have heart, and the food is definitely a cut above usual Station Casinos buffet fare. (Green Valley Ranch is better but not by much). When I have visitors come in to Vegas this is the first buffet I take them to. In short every buffet has shortcomings but this is one that has never left me disappointed or thinking I won't come back."
0,"This review is based on my experience with the automated car wash portion of this company. \n\nI used the automatic car wash on a couple different occasions.  Almost every trip through my truck would exit filthier than it entered!  That is disappointing considering this place is a minute away from where I live.\n\nI take the appearance of my vehicle very seriously, so with that said, I have chosen to not spend my money at this facility."
0,"Poor. I don't understand what all the hubbub is about over this place. The meat was dry and lacked flavor. It tasted like they bought frozen meat and used that instead of smoking it themselves. I was very disappointed with the food. If you want real bbq, go to Texas."
0,"The food is actually fairly mediocre.  But with an endless supply of buy one/get one coupons they distribute, it's one of those \""why not\"" sort of places for a breakfast for two."
1,"Great late night place to eat. Drinks here are great, endless options. If your looking for a place to bring your friends or guest downtown this is the place to go."
1,"Both times I have been to U of P Stadium it has been for college football games and both times Ohio State lost (I'm thinking the Buckeyes are cursed there). Despite that, I have had good experiences at this stadium. We sat down low (100 level) on the 40 yard line and had excellent views of the entire field and the large scoreboard during the BCS Championship. During the Fiesta Bowl on January 5, 2009, we sat in section 403, row 15 on the aisle and again had great seats. We had an amazing view of the entire field, which I was surprised by being in a corner section. Also, while we were in the 400 level, we were not that high up at all. The only negative about section 403 is that you can not see the large scoreboard and have to rely on the very small screen at the opposite end. Parking last night for the Fiesta Bowl was 1000% better than during the National Championship game - it feels like they figured out how to get cars out of the Blue lots within minutes, which is great. We were out of the lot within two minutes of arriving back at the car.\n\nSecurity lines were pretty long an hour before the game, but they moved quickly. The escalators are not that well marked when you walk in, but once you find them, it's pretty quick to get to your seats. When my sister and I went to get concessions prior to the start of the game, we walked right up and were back in our seats within five minutes. Plus the cashier only charged me for my beer ($8.25) and not the fries, so that was sweet! For both games I attended, I found the bathroom lines to be short which I attribute to the fact that there are numerous facilites spread around the stadium.\n\nI'm anti-football and baseball in domed stadiums and U of P stadium does not change that opinion. However, that does not take away the fact, that they seem to do a good job hosting events. I was quite taken aback both times on how chilly U of P stadium is being a domed stadium though. I hope to return next season for a Cardinals game to get a true sense of the atmosphere in the stadium."

0,"If you want a really thurough job, don't use this company.  They did not do my windows, nor do they do walls.  Did not clean kitchen backsplash.  Just picked up the big chunks.  Saved me some time but was hoping for better."
0,"So after many ppl's recommendations of coming here, i bit the bullet and went.  I had the owner cut my hair and an hour later, he was quite pleased.  I was not.  But...i said to myself \""Self, you usually hate your haircuts in the salon because they style it funny, and then you go home, wash it, and go..Ohhh...not that bad\""  So I withheld judgement until I got home.\n\nNow...after a shower...i hate it even more.  I seriously probably had this haircut in the 3rd grade.  After my mom cut my hair.  with blunt scissors.  Really?  I look like my head was attacked by gum-eaters and my *friends* had no choice but to chop it off with a swiss-army knife.  It's uneven, its bland, and its got random long/short pieces for texture.  Good god, if you like your head, go somewhere else.  \n\nOr call my mom and she'll give you this haircut for free"
0,"Today was the first time I have been here.  My daughter (who loves wings) wanted to try it.  We arrived at about 4:20 in the afternoon and were seated right away.  Our server took the drink orders quickly and by 4:30 we had ordered our food.  That was the last we saw of our server for another 30 minutes!  All around servers and kitchen staff were having wonderful chat time at the expense of the diners.  When the server came to ask if we wanted refills, I asked about our food (boneless wings and spinach artichoke flatbread) and was told that it should be done shortly, but the flatbread takes a little longer in the oven.  My refill and our meal arrived at the same time, another 15 minutes later.  I'm sorry, but if the flatbread takes over 40 minutes to make, there should really be a warning in the menu.  Was the food good- yeah.  Was it 45 minutes good- nope, nothing really is, especially an appetizer!"
0,"The scenery views are gorgeous! It's the only reason why I bumped it up one more star: cuz of the views. The \""tour\"" itself was terrible, more like non-existent.\n\nThe price for the tour, entrance fees, bus shuttles, food were over priced. \n\nFirst off, the bus ride was terrible. We kinda knew that the bus was jankier than the tour bus we took going there, especially since the windows weren't completely sealed. It seemed like the windows were about to fall off the bus entirely. Any how, there was this one stretch where we were just going through paved dirt with big rocks protruding here and there, making the ride extremely bumpy and stuff started falling off the upper compartments. To make things worse, a car on the opposite side of the road zoomed past us, stirring up dust everywhere...even INSIDE the bus. Talk about a literal dust bowl in your tour bus. That was fun...everybody hacking away, while others were grabbing for whatever napkin, tissue, paper, plastic BAGS, to cover their mouths with. \n\nThen upon arrival, there wasn't too much to see. I mean, the views were great, don't get me wrong, but that's nature. I am referring to the native american dance. They seemed so lethargic...And all we saw were them going about in a circle, shuffling their feet. We were waiting for 10 mins to see if they would change their dance a lil, maybe add some hand motions, but I kinda knew that they wouldn't be since one of the women (of two dancers) was already holding a water bottle with both her hands. How can you dance while holding onto something unless you weren't going to use it?\n\nGuano Point: Where we got to eat the food...wasn't at all special. It was more of an American meal, but overpriced. The view was, once again, amazing, but you would think that since they charge us so much, why don't they do something special...I mean, there are many areas that you can go into Grand Canyon for free, and you can experience the same views and such, but if you wanted to charge people, at least do something to make it memorable."
0,"I went here when I dropped my iPhone (tragedy...) and broke the speaker. I could hear my callers, but they couldn't hear me. I went in to Best Buy to see if I could just buy one of those cheap pay-as-you-go phones, because I had some urgent business calls to make, and had planned to be running around town all day. I looked around with a customer service rep, who was in fact friendly. But after some wasted time, we came to the conclusion that they had nothing to offer me.  In short, I have no problem with the customer service at this location. But I wish such a big chain would not forget to supply their stores with the simple/affordable options. This could be my old fashioned preference, but if I want to by a non-color screen flip phone, I'd hope I could find it at one of the biggest electronic stores in the nation."
1,"Tried this place for takeout once and deemed it was not half bad. Dined in the restaurant tonight and this is my take:\n\nThe restaurant atmosphere was simple, clean, and very relaxed. Almost like an order-at-the-counter-then-seat-yourself kind of place. There was indeed table service albeit not the friendliest, but also not bad. BF and I decided to share the full rack of baby backs plus two sides: beans and potato salad. Everything came out in speedy time (there were maybe 3 other tables of people) and was warm, but let me tell you, this is not a place that concerns themselves with presentation. Everything was served in single use paper or plastic containers - the sides even had lids on them! Not a big deal but almost made me wonder, \""What did we get ourselves into?\"". Aesthetics aside everything was good. I thought the potato salad was a nice consistency and balanced, very complimentary to the BBQ. The beans were basic and enjoyable. The ribs came out barely wet but extra sauce was offered immediately. Once sauced up to my liking we dug in and were very pleased. Great taste, extremely meaty, and very tender. My only complaint is that there are little bits of bone and gristle to be picked out but that's sort of expected in place like this. The cornbread that came with the meal left much to be desired which is kind of surprising for a rib place. Overall, for the price we paid we were well-fed and our rib craving was satisfied. We even took about half the rack home. Would definitely return and recommend this place to friends. \n\nTIP: we used the Yelp $10 for $20 so we only ended up paying $6 (plus tip). There were tons of specials listed, too, like 2 for 1 Tuesday lunches so that makes this place even more of a bargain."
0,the food was good the prices and portion size was lacking immensely. we had a $50 dollar bill and left still hungry. If you need a snack before a meal at one of the other restaurants go here. there steamed buns were handmade and good.
0,"WOW, Extremely overpriced and rude.  I understand you don't want kids in your establishment but you are right next to a children's museum.  We went there starving and left mildly hungry after dropping $50 on ok pizza.  I have definitely had better at a lower price but the main reason I am even reviewing this place is how rude the wait staff was."
1,"Amazing food, great service, great prices. Great buffet for lunch and quick take out. I LOVE this place!"
0,"It was ok. Went for valentines day, was not happy that they really didn't do anything to give it a valantine feel, I didn't need pink stuff everywhere but maybe some ambience music or something, a lady playing the harp, some music or something... It was a dull vibe, staff was friendly, food was just ok, not up to par for the price... I ordered a well done steak and it came medium at best but it was ok..."
0,"Susan and Mary Sue did not WOW us.\n\nMy wife and I were looking for a place for a light bite for dinner and decided to try this place. We shared the Kobe Beef Sopes, Watercress salad and Tecate Carnitas. We told the waiter that we had a late buffet lunch and will order a few dishes to share. He seems to be very concern that we did not order enough food and kept asking if we want to order more. This made us felt uncomfortable.\n\nFirst to come was the Kobe Beef Sopes. It was tiny piece of beef wrapped in two quarter size corn masa topped with mango red cabbage mint slaw. The slaw was well seasoned and very tasty. However, I can really taste much of the beef since it was so small.\n\nNext, we had the Watercrest, Jaicama and Orange Salad. The salad was topped with 4 little bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and blue cheese. The salad was very ordinary and the bacon wrapped dates were salty.\n\nLastly, we had the Tecate Carnitas. They gave us a good portion of the carnitas for this dish. However, the taste and quality of the roast pork is very mediocre. It is like the carnitas you get from an ordinary Mexican restaurant. There was only one piece tortilla came with the dish and it was all dried and cracked. It was not something that I expected a high end restaurant would serve to its diner.\n\nWhen our bill came at the end of our meal, we found that there was $1 charge for  tap water in addition to the our  other drinks. We dinned at many fine restaurants in Las Vegas and never have anyone charge for tap water."
1,"Love this place, I've been coming for years and the same family has been here since I can remember which means their food is just as good today. Cheese steaks are great and make sure you get the grilled peppers!"
1,"This mall is located in the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino. I usually only come here for H&M and Urban Outfitters. However, you can get lost in this mall very easily. It's hard to find the directory here (maybe it's because of the dim lighting), but you should grab a pamphlet near the entrance so you can just carry a mall map around with you (trust me, you'll need it).\n\nWe are starving when we came so our first stop was to find a reasonable priced restaurant. We walked around the entire mall looking for a directory! We ended up eating at Ocean One Bar & Grille near the rainstorm area. \n\nIf you've never been to Vegas, you should at least stop by this mall and check it out. The rainstorm is pretty near since before Vegas, I've never seen that in a mall before."
1,"I come here a lot. Like pretty much daily a lot. It's getting weird. Why you ask? I'm not a huge fan of chains. The espresso is great. They roast the beans in-house. They display local art. The people watching is fun. The patio is shaded and dog-friendly. The employees and owner are friendly, some might even say charming. No seriously, ask Lisa, the owner. She'll tell you she's charming. \n\nBetween my house and place of work there are at least 20 different options for coffee. The usual suspects: Starbucks, Coffee Bean, some local jobs, and even a strangely placed Dunkin Donuts. I go in the wrong direction every morning to go here though. They're fast. Even faster now that I have a pattern of ordering. The latte is usually waiting on the bar for me by the time my card gets processed. \n\nAnd that, my friends, is why I have become the Duchess of this fine establishment and lived happily ever after in the Land of (soy) Milk and Honey. \n\n(ok, that last part is a touch dramatic, but seriously, it's good here. Go.)"
1,Second time here.  Food is yummy and fun for east Mesa. We will be back cuz Carly rocks!!
1,"I didn't actually buy any plants here because I don't have a yard and my balcony is already stuffed with tiny potted seedlings, but if I DID, I would come here to transform my house into a desert oasis! They have a huge selection of trees and flowers and cacti and everything you could imagine.\n\nThere are also BIG, colorful birds everywhere, friendly kitties (one followed us around for a while, and then let us follow him to a nice little nook with an olive tree and fountain), bunnies, humongous tortoises, turtles and even more birds. I think we spent an hour here just exploring. It is totally worth a visit just to wander around!"
0,"My family has owned this timeshare for years. The last time we visited (about 4 yrs ago) I would have given it 4 stars. First of all, they are no longer Monarch Resorts, they are Diamond Resorts (which they were very vague about this transition). We got there on a Friday around 12pm. They took us to the \""VIP\"" check-in. The lady was really, really nice but I get the feeling the employees no longer have a clue what the hell is going on with this new ownership. Our check-in was supposed to be at 1pm so she said since we were early that she would go ahead and get us into a room right away. \""A room with a nice view and a better room than the one that was reserved.\"" We were like, \""Woooow well thank you, we really are VIP.\"" Pfff! We go up to the room and the following happened:\n As soon as we stepped out of the elevator, we noticed it was HOT and muggy. And *crickets*. I mean it's good that a place isn't packed but we thought it was odd that it was super quiet...ghost town. We go into the room and the place is a mess!! And I kid you not, looked like it was being used as storage (which I know realize it probably was). So we call right away and they tell us to come down to the front desk. coming to find out, that whole building was empty bc it was going through \""renovations?\"" And guess what? The people that has reservations in that building were sent to other rooms...and guess what? Our room was taken by someone else! So we waited for over an hour to get a room. So for our \""troubles\"" they give us 3 complimentary breakfasts for the 3 adults (as in, the 2 kids in your party don't get jack squat). So whatever, we go down to breakfast the next day and again we notice it's like ghost town. We go to the cafe on the voucher and it's closed! So we go to the building that has the bar and we go in there and after waiting for him (only guy working there) to get off the phone he says we can order breakfast there. Which I will say, was good. We end up paying $30 for drinks and the 2 extra breakfasts for the kids. Monday morning we have a meeting. This meeting consisted of them trying to convince us to buy directly from Diamond Resorts BUT you must continue to pay your Monarch Resort payment. Yes...2 payments. Well, at least we will use other Diamond Resort places but they def need to work on Cancun. It's such a beautiful place with horrible service! \n\nExtra star is for the convenience of the rooms (2 rooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen/dining room, living room, tv in each room, refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, pots/pan, plates, cups, utensils).\n \nPS- No more shuttle, pools were closed the whole time expect for one small area."
0,"The Skinny: there's a reason why it's a pub - when you drink enough, the food has got to taste better (2), service - cute little Britney Spear-esque school girl outfits does not constitute good service unless - well, you're some place else (2), value - there's no value on bad food.\n\nTo sum up our experience: when we got into the car, the first thing my husband said was \""do you think I'll get sick from the chicken pot pie?\""\n\nWe headed here looking for a slice of British fare, ordering fish and chips, chicken/leek pie, and a side salad.\n\nTo start, the chicken pot pie was absymal. Albeit the pastry was a nice flaky crust, the filling was sour and unpleasant. I have no idea why it was sour. Hence, the question about my husband's intestinal health soon afterwards (he's fine but felt like he dodged a bullet). The uninspired mashed potatoes came with a generic gravy and frozen peas.\n\nThe fried fish was overbreaded, greasy and soggy on the bottom from either the moisture of the fish or the oil pool on the plate. The accompanying tartar sauce was too heavy on the mayo and lacked acidity to cut through the richness of the sauce. The chips were not crispy on the outside and were bleh.\n\nThe side salad was okay but the house vinegar/oil dressing had chunks of dried rosemary in it which made it unappetizing.\n\nFinally, our waitress. We had to wave her several times to refill our drinks and she gave us the wrong check. I think she switched our check with the table next to us which is a bit mistake on her part (their check was 3x more than ours). I felt bad for her at the end of the day.\n\nAs someone who appreciates beer and British culture, I could see this place being fun to check out a football game or some great brews. As a person who is just coming for the food, I would suggest you spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere."
0,"The service was awful but the food was worst.  A number of dishes from the chef's tasting menu, which is $75 per person, were over-seasoned and unimpressive.  The potatoes and carrots in the turkey pot pie were undercooked in addition the turkey stew had way too much pepper which blew away my palate.  The following course was a white fish that was so salty that it was inedible.  Save your time, money, and palate by going to either the Citizen Public House or Tommy V's Urban Kitchen in downtown Scottsdale for a better meal."
1,"Simple and bomb food. Nice little nook in the wall, great to chill and enjoy pizza."
0,"My husband and I had lunch here several weeks ago.  The server was warm and efficient (she said she was a teacher full time).  We loved the food and the ambiance.\n\nWe brought friends here for dinner last night to introduce them to Barrelhouse and expected a similar experience.  Instead our server, though pleasant, was totally in over her head.  It took 20 minutes to get a cocktail, and when it came, she served the wrong cocktail to the wrong person.  We asked what the soup of the day was, and she gave a confusing description, no name, just some of the things in it.  After taking the order, she had to come back and ask for it again.  Salads came out with the entree and she brought the wrong type of salad to one of us.  She forgot to split the check (which we asked her for up front before ordering), sent beverages to the wrong table, and when we paid, applied the wrong card to the wrong party.  We almost settled the difference among ourselves so we wouldn't have to wait another 20 minutes for her to correct it.\n\nRegardless, the food was EXCELLENT.  It is such a shame to have a good meal ruined by poor service.  We would like to come back, but ask that the management do a much better job of recruiting and training their staff.\n\nWe will try again, but won't accept the same server.  I doubt our friends will be repeat customers.\n\nWe need this type of restaurant in Chandler.  PLEASE clean up your act."
1,"The quality of the food here is pretty good but some of the \""small plate\"" items are not easily shared.  It is best if you have two or three people in order to really sample the menu and not break the bank.  Otherwise, you are going to end up needing to order a lot to be full and satisfied.\n\nWe were there with a party of 5 so the sharing idea was a little more difficult than normal.   This would be a great place to grab a lite bite before heading elsewhere for your main entrees.\n\nAll in all I do really like this place.  I think it is has a cool atmosphere and is in a fun location in Charlotte.  I love the idea of tapas and this place has a nice variety on their menu.\n\n\nI ordered the Canelinni Cake which was on top of an arugala salad and had a carmelized apple on top and was drizzled with a red pepper sauce.  It was a little bland but once I took a bite with the apple and dipped it in the sauce it was much better.  I also ordered the seared scallops.  They had a very nice consistency.  They were buttery, smooth and melted in my mouth.  They were also very fresh but the one negative is that they were served warm and turned cold pretty quickly.\n\nOthers at the table ordered  the Apple & Fig plate which is served on toasted focaccia with brie sauce, butternut squash soup, and the Mediterranean shrimp that is baked with peppers, tomatoes, onions and cheese and served on focaccia bread.  All were said to be very good as well!  \n\nThey had several other yummy options including cheese plates, pork medallions and chocolate bread pudding for dessert!\n\nAs I previously mentioned, this is a fun place with good food.  It has the atmosphere of an intimate wine cellar.  I think if used for the right purposes it is a great place to check out!  They have special events, live music on the weekends and wine pairing specials."
0,"I've been to this location for 2 years due to the proximity of it to me.  Trust me, if there was another gym nearby I would be there.\n\nThe equipment hasn't changed in two years.  I often see 'Out of Service' on many of the items.  Upstairs the cardio area definitely could use some extra ellipticals.  Amazingly they have not added any in 2 years!!  As one reviewer said at night there is usually a wait for them.  \n\nThe worst though?  The service.  In two years I've been greeted about half the time.  This is a management issue.  I know it's reaaaaallly difficult to show your front staff how to say 'hello', but there are plenty of classes that can help you.\n\nBTW, if you're a prospect, make sure to take a tour of the cardio area during times you'll be there so you get an idea if machines will be available.  \n\nAll in all, the gym is old and most times they just don't care."
1,"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas... every day of the week. At least it is here at Coach House. \n\nCoach House was one of the first bars I visited upon my arrival to the Valley. Coming from the dive capital of the state (Tucson), dive bars were my safe haven and I heard that Coach House was the mother of all dive bar safe havens. As the oldest bar in Scottsdale, it deserves this title too.\n\nCoach House is ugly. It is. It's dirty. Sometimes the bathrooms are broken. And don't even think about using the boy's bathroom if the girl's is out of commission. In that case you hold it or you use the portapotty outside. At Coach House, you respect the regulars and don't think about messing with them. Those who act like they are better than you shouldn't step inside Coach House and you shouldn't enter unless you plan on stumbling out and as happy and drunk as can be. Bar crawls? You have to start here. Wedding weekend? One too many cocktails at the rehearsal dinner and you'll see the suits stumble in. Bachelor/ette parties? I've seen the boas and crowns stop in on the way to the bars. And then you've got your golfers, day drinkers, sports enthusiasts, locals and college kids taking up the rest of the bar. \n\nChristmas lights light up the Coach House on a regular day but come the Christmas season and you won't be able to walk a step without seeing a new Christmas decoration or lights in front of you. Coach House is the staple bar in Old Town. It's not a bottle service \""so Scottsdale\"" bar, it's dive bar you call home and miss when you're on vacation."
1,"This experience was better than any other time I have ever stayed here- and that says a lot because, I have always had a great time.\nUpon check-in , we were greeted with the Prickly Pear Margarita's. \nThe room smelled so cleaned upon walking into it. \nEvery day we visited the pool and had such a great time relaxing. The towels were removed after an hour , to avoid people saving seats and not returning for hours, which seems to be an improvement from the last few times we have been there,\nEvery night we really enjoyed the live music. The Water's were incredible and very entertaining. A huge step up from the previous years we had been there and heard the entertainment. The wait staff , during the music, was not pushy for you to order food or drinks and genuinely wanted you to enjoy yourself.\nI had a massage at the spa and that was phenomenal! I enjoyed the mineral pool and hot and cold plunge pools after. That was the most relaxed I had felt in over a year or two.\n100% will be back and will continue to tell all of my friends about this place for a amazing getaway. \nWhether you are single, married or with your family and children, you can not go wrong here. \nThanks again, Gainey Ranch , for the incredible vacation."
1,"Man... there are a LOT of cougars here. Like the over 30 type, with heavy makeup, and that creepy \""cougar stare\"". The one that lets you know inside, that to them, your fine young ass is prey...\n\nIf you talk to them, notice how they have a pause between each statement, comment, or question that they tell you. They are cautiously calculating what to say, because they got missile lock on you. \n\nWednesdays is Ladies Night, which is prime cougaring hunting grounds. And then there is Thursdays Latin Night, there is a small drop on the cougar population, but remember, travel in a pack to avoid getting pounced on. \n\nThey provide industry discounts for retail employees on The Strip, or restaurant employees with their health cards. 50% off all drinks and a few dishes. Show the bartender your wristband that you got from the hostess. \n\nI recommend the PB & J Cocktail from this one guy that works here. He adds a bit of salt to bring out the flavor of the peanut butter. Thats probably the most unique drink I remembered seeing on the menu. \n\nThe drivers in the Town Square Parking Lot are terrible. They don't check their mirrors before backing up, or they will do turns that are too sharp that can clip your car, etc. And we are talking about hours right past 10PM. It's a rats nest of shitty drivers in this shopping area. I'd rather take my car to the valet."

Not cheap, like every food spot at the LVH, and food so-so.  If you pass McDonalds on the way to the LVH, I'd respectively suggest you stop there rather than here...you won't miss the food and you'll have a plenty more $$ in your pocket.  Too bad, LVH could use a really good sandwich spot...\n\nOh, and they're not open 24 hrs; they're closed 6am to 11am I believe..."
0,Never coming here again! Dirty place! Table next to us been dirty since we got here. Food is taking too long been waiting for 40 mins and still waiting while writing this.  While restaurant is empty only 2 tables!!! My drink bloody Mary full of Tabasco is done. My 2 boys are tired of waiting. I don't recommend this place
1,"Perfect getaway with your spouse.  Great location for quickly getting to many area attractions (list below) and the property is top shelf.  Love the small size but access to cozy bar at Lon's, great restaurant, pool, allows Hermosa to compete with larger hotels.  Beehive fireplace in the room and we had patio doors open to sunny, grassy patio (room 117).  Perfect for relaxing after your day drinking excursions.\n\nUse Hermosa Inn as your base of operation for hiking (Squaw Peak and Camelback are less than 10 minutes away), day drinking (Postino has fantastic happy hour starting at noon), and dining (Postino, La Orange, Chelsea Kitchen, St Francis, The Vig, and many more)."
1,"Stayed here for the first time after 20 straight years staying downtown mostly at the Plaza and Nugget.  What a terrific hotel, casino and atmosphere.  They are doing everything right here - including offering clean, simple and comfortable rooms, top quality service, excellent dining options and great location.  We will stay at the Downtown Grand from now on - and the casino host (Marnelli) was the most professional and friendly person with whom our group has dealt.  Thanks Grand!"

0,"After my trip to China, I went here with the family for a graduation dinner celebration.  The place is modern and clean.  The place was empty.\n\nWe got a bunch of entrees to share: Hong Kong Chow Mein, Tropical Fried Rice, Beef with Broccoli, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Wok-Fired Salmon with Thai Basil Sauce and Chicken with Mixed Veggies.  I liked the Salmon with Thai Basil Sauce - it was breaded and crispy fried and the sauce was good. Everything else tasted alright.  You can get better tasting food for much less in Chinatown.\n\nThe desserts were pretty good.  We had the mango pudding - tasted like real mangoes instead of fake medicine-tasting garbage.  We also got the banana spring rolls with ice cream.\n\nI feel bad for the hostess wearing a cheong sam.  One passerby was like \""you're not even Chinese! You're Mexican!\""  Yup, this is faux Chinese/ faux Asian at its finest!"
1,Love this place !!! Best specials all week long!!! Great food and a fun place to hangout !!!

1,My go to. They may only have two people but they are good and very personable. Some ppl may not like the fact that when they are busy they get turned away but when you actually stay you leave happy.
0,"\""We take our time\"" should be the theme here for the employees, especially at the check-out stand.  Seriously, this is an at your own pace sort of place, with no shame whatsoever.\n\nAll I wanted was a belt because I forgot to pack one in the suitcase and it took almost 20 minutes to go through the check-out line and I was 3rd in line."
1,"I have now visited La Mestiza twice, and I can't say enough good things about this place. We've struggled to find good Mexican food in Madison. La Mestiza will not satisfy your need for a giant burrito or tacos - it's not the traditional Mexican restaurant you find in America with combination plates. La Mestiza serves a relatively small menu composed of dishes highlighting the traditional regional cuisines of Mexico. \n\nThe dishes are a little bit pricey, but you get everything you expect in a pricey meal. The presentation is gorgeous, and the food is fresh and delicious. I personally recommend the enchiladas pollo con mole - their traditonal Oaxacan mole sauce is phenomenal, with all the subtle nuttiness and rich chocolate flavors I pray for when I order mole. We've ordered specials as well as the carne asada, and they all elicited \""ooo\""s and \""aahhh\""s. They have an excellent house margarita and a couple of Mexican draft beers.\n\nThe restaurant is very small, but cozy and pleasant. This is a casual restaurant that attracts a wide variety of people. The decor is inviting and comfortable, with interesting artwork hanging on the walls and paper cut-outs strung from the ceiling in a playful, un-tacky sort of way. Do come here to eat at a table - the bar only has a couple of chairs and seems to be intended only for people who are waiting for their take-out orders.\n\nFinally, the service is excellent. I've had two different servers (who were both there both times I've visited), and they offer the knowledgeable, understated, and appropriately attentive service I would expect from a fine dining restaurant."
1,"As all previous reviewers have said, these guys are AWESOME. Outstanding service. The service tech actually came out to the parking lot with his clipboard to greet me as soon as I drove in.\n\nIn and out in less than an hour. Take a little walk to the nearby Barnes & Noble to browse a little while, and it's all done.\n\nThey also do free tire checks and will maintain the air pressure for you. Very courteous, friendly and hardworking people. They earn their five star rating for sure!"
0,"I forgot how unpleasant it is to go to this guitar center. Nobody greeted or bothered asking if I needed anything. The place was empty and several employees were in front of me several times and made me feel invisible. I'm glad I can buy online, not a guitar center. I'll do my shopping at Amazon or Sam Ash, they are really nice people and always treat me like a good customer. Never coming back to this guitar center."
1,"A Romantasy Cabaret show is something you do not want to miss! There is a variety of talent from singing to silent movies, mentalists to burlesque and belly dancers ! The  saucy  Mizz Lucy Morals will entertain you through out the show and you will  have an experience to tell all your friends the next day!!  It is perfect for couples, groups or just letting loose with some friends!  I love that people come in costume to feel like they are part of the show!  I'll be back and I hope to meet you there!"
1,"It's a neighborhood dive bar. Cash only.  Despite its location, if you are looking for some hipster joint, this ain't it.\n\nHowever, I have spent many nights in here for one reason only: Aurora.  If you ever frequented Newman's before it closed, this is the same bartender, the one with the bell and the Macho Man tip jar.  She is the best bartender of all time as long as you are respectful toward her.  And, she makes great drinks.\n\nThey have 2 pool tables, but usually one is out of order.  And they just got a fancy-schmancy jukebox.  The bathrooms are small, one toilet rooms, but it's more than enough to serve the crowd."
1,"Had the day off work and my oldest daughter was at home too, thought to myself, man I haven't gone out with just her in a while, let's go get breakfast. Asked her if she was game and she said yea and that she wanted some comfort food, so off to Chase's Diner we went!\n\nOk I don't know what all the fuss is about, this is a diner, not a fine wining & dining , this is diner food.  I personally like Chase's, I have gone here quite a few times with my kids for dinner, and they have good burgers and home-style comfort food, just never had breakfast.\n\nSo I ordered the works skillet that had peppers, onions, ham, potatoes and came with English muffing, now that was some good food! It was perfect! \n\nMy daughter ordered the Volcano, which were 2 huge buttermilk biscuits smothered in sausage gravy with a side of hash browns, man did that look delish!!!! She loved every bit!!\n\nThis diner is a good place for a fast home style meal!  I will be back!\n\nOh yea they have this great breakfast deal too, 2 pancakes and choice of either sausage or bacon for 3.99!"
1,"I love this place. I have been coming a long time and it has always been great. My husband likes spicy, so he goes for those kind of dishes. I like not spicy, so I go for the assorted vegetable with chicken. Great sauce, great prices."
1,"I always thought Bingo was for old people, and then I went to Reflections Bingo Hall and was immediately hooked!  The first time I went I won 1k on my second game, and my friend that went with me won $500 on her 6th game!  Since then we have continued to play and have continued to win!\n\nSome may say that Bingo is boring or does not provoke enough action, but I love it!  This place serves your tradition fried selection of food, which is okay to snack on while you're gaming, but overall makes the place stink like old grease.  There is a smoking room in the back that is closed off, and every once in a while you can hear someone from there faintly yell \""BINGO!\""\n\nIf it is your first time going you get to pick out a free dabber.  The staff is friendly and humorous, and I seem to have good luck on the game when I chat with Danny.\n\nThe only thing I do NOT recommend playing is their game that starts at 10 pm.  I cannot remember the name of it, but I blew through 20 bucks in 30 minutes.  It was not fun."
0,"Our options were Vdara or Aria but we decided to give MGM a shot since the name has spoken for itself throughout the years... \n\nSoooooooooooooooo, we were a group of 4 friends from the East coast and went to Vegas for the World Series Rugby tournament..When we arrived we were shocked when we saw the tube TV, no refridgerator/microwave and internet access unless u paid extra $!@#$%^&*. Old wall mounts and paintings and carpet..our room was of course 3 miles away from the elevators.' \nRoom service was OK, but one day they cleaned the room and did not offer clean towels...we had to call 12 hrs later...they left one bar of soap no refills on toilet tissue..the blue/blk pillow is very disgusting do not lay ur head on it!.. When we got the fridge it was an old old old one, that was delivered on an old Formica cart which ended up taking too much of our room space...en left our drinks frozen...again at an extra charge.....We could not warm up leftovers as having a microwave is also extra $ any-who....... \nPROS \nYou get the Vegas feel on the main floor with all the gaming machines \nThe lions \nThe buffet is clean. \nLocation \n\nCONS \nNo variety at the buffet \nNo free Internet, fridge,microwave \nOld TV \nThe bartender at the Centrifuge.....very rude! \nThey change bed linen every 3 days of your stay! \nWall decor pre historic age! \n\nIt is just soooo overrated......not worth the $... \nNext time i would go for the newer hotels Aria, Vdara..and the soon to be Cosmopolitan... \nWhat does MGM mean? \nMy Gross Motel?????????????/"
1,"I like the food here.  It is as Rebecca said, not traditional and there is stuff on the menu for kids as well.  The layout is kinda fun and there is live music on the patio.  If they happen to have the peanut butter pie for dessert, GET IT.  It was heavenly!\n\nWith regard to S.A.'s review, the band that played there 4/25 was The Big Zephyr, of which I happen to be a member.  We are playing there again this coming Saturday night 6/13/09 from 7-10."
0,We had family in town so met them there for drinks. It had been several years since I last went there so figured we would check it out. It was around 11:30 when we went and they seemed to have a mix of dueling pianos and karaoke going on. That seemed okay but all the tables were made up for dining and it just seemed like it didn't know if it wanted to be a pub or restaurant. We left after one drink because with the odd seating and how ridiculously loud it was there wash couldn't talk much. We won't be going back.
0,"I was seeing a show at the Dodge Theater, was short on time, and hungry! I wasn't sure what restaurants were around the Dodge, so my friend and I walked down Washington, confident that we'd stumble upon something at some point. And we did, it was Tom's Restaurant and Tavern. They seemed to have a pretty decent beer selection, and open tables, which we were happy to find so close to the show. \n\nWe sat down and took a look at the menu. It was a special event menu, which I really hate. I don't see the point of restricting the menu so much just because of a show down the street. There were about 4 vegetarian options, few of which seemed appetizing. My friend opted for the potato skins sans chili and I opted for the jalapeno hummus. The waiter returned some time later to let me know that they were out of the hummus, and gave me a different menu that had the aldo pasta listed. penne pasta, marinara sauce, parmesan cheese and garlic bread- i was sold. The food arrived, and wasn't bad. The pasta was pretty small, but was enough to fill me up, and my friend seemed ok with her potato skins. \n\nOverall, the food was ok, but it was really the service that caused me to rate them with only two stars. I'm not sure if our server is a server by trade- it seemed like it might have been his first night. He was super slow and had a really hard time remembering what we had ordered. He also seemed to have to have a hard time with keeping our orders straight and not confusing them with the orders of the tables next to us. I was also really disappointed by the menu. I know that this is more of an old-fashioned diner, but the options were so limited that it was actual work finding something to eat (I'm sorry, but when I was hoping for some cheese or some spicy flavor, a plate of steamed veggies just doesn't sound appetizing). \n\nI'd be willing to give this place another shot, but definitely not on an \""event\"" night, because it was really pretty lame."
0,"This started out as a 5 star review a few hours ago. Service was fantastic, sandwiches delicious. I got the buffalo chicken my husband the bac-hammon. Within 2 hours we are both sitting here very sick. Something was contaminated! The only two items that were the same on our sandwiches were mayo and provolone. So it was that or someone failed to wash their hands. Sorry, but after this incident i don't think we will be returning :("
0,"Sunday night. Fairly busy, and there was a fun buzz goin' round the place. We were a party of five and seated fairly quickly.\n\nChips were fairly decent, and 'twas nice that they give you decent amounts of salsa plus a giant dollop of refried beans to go with 'em.\n\nDrinks came promptly, and they took our food order. This is where the restaurant experience ENDS. LOL.\n\nMost of my group ordered entree's, and I ordered soup. Shouldn't be anything extraordinary about it. Food wait was at least 30-minutes!! \n\nI will give them these positive reinforcements - \n\n1. Server was nice.\n\n2. I ordered a tortilla soup, and it was hearty, and a good portion. I ordered extra avocado, and they gave me generous amounts.\n\n3. The server came 'round and noticed that our drinks were empty (ONCE), but it sure as hell took him a long time to come back!!!\n\nAmbience had a fun vibe.\nCompany was good.\nService was horrible. \nFood was OK. Soup had too much of a tomato-ey base, but it was still OK.\n\nWouldn't come back unless I had to, though."
1,Great selection of beads and beading materials.  Friendly staff too.
0,"We were hopeful for a great meal.  The view is great and the staff was friendly.   The food, unfortunately, was not very good.  I had to send my steak back because it was over-cooked.  The next time the steak was raw.  They ended up taking it off the bill.  My friend had the pork chop and half of it was good.  The other half was under-cooked.  We will not be returning."
1,"This place is great!  So many cool video games, awesome booths, and a dance floor playing some very cool old school tunes.  Who can't have fun here?\n\nI blew it on Centipede - last time I made it to the boards.  This time...I stank.  I need to return to overcome this very sad performance."
1,"My boyfriend and I went to Monti's for our one-year anniversary, and it was fantastic. It's not incredibly fancy or highly priced which was perfect for us as college students living on our own. We were looking for something that had a nice atmosphere and good food that would offer a great experience without breaking the bank. I believe the bill was around $75 for the two of us which was both of our dinners and about three drinks. \nMonti's is huge and we were seated in a room that had a fountain in it which was pretty cute and gave the room a nice vibe. We both agreed that we were impressed with both the service, the food, the decor, and the all around experience. It's no wonder this place has been around for such a long time (as matter of fact, my parents went to Monti's on their first date!). \nAll in all it was a wonderful experience and we will be returning!"
1,"Not only does this restaurant have an amazing view, but the food is amazing. The images on their website look meh, but when you get there you will not be disappointed. The staff is delightful. The portions are generous. I can't say enough about how great this place is."
0,"My wedding was 2-27-14.  We looked around for a chapel in Vegas and found that this one was our favorite.  We really liked the marquee option and 50's diner.  On the web site it also said you could create your own wedding package.  I emailed the chapel and one of there wedding coordinators responded right away.  Shannon was awesome and every question I had she responded quickly and it was super easy.  She said I could pay in full at the chapel the day of but I didn't want to deal with that the day of my wedding so she told me how to pay online.  I emailed Shannon and she assured me that I was paid in full.  The day before my wedding I went in and the gal behind the counter assured me it was paid in full and I signed my receipts.  The day of my wedding completely different story. They said I had a balance remaining.  I told them I had just been in there and they said it was paid in full.  They couldn't figure out what the problem was but said I could talk to the manager.  I had my whole family there so I wasn't about to delay my wedding to do so.  We were on a time frame because of dinner reservations.  I paid and said I would talk to the manager after.  When we walked in everyone was there and that's when they decided to ask us what kind of vows we wanted and music.  The flowers were wrong which they corrected.  The photographer was a Gestapo!  Everyone thought she was a *****. The minister was AWESOME!!!!!  SO MUCH FUN!!!  At the end we had to take pics and when I said that I would like a certain pose she cut me off saying we weren't there yet.!!  My wedding was not even 5min long but the photographer was rushing us through.  I ended up writing a email to Shannon to express how I appreciated her but how it fell apart and I would just like a refund for the extra I had to pay on my wedding day.  She responded quickly and was awesome.  Her manager Brian emailed me right away and said he could give me a refund or give me a credit on pics.  We chose the pics.  He was great.  Chose pics and when I finally got them, they sent them to the wrong address,  2 where wrong.  One was the wrong size and one we didn't even order.  I emailed Brian and he was great once again, forwarding my email to Cindy who was in charge of the photos I suppose.  She not so great.  She said the one picture was not the right size because it would have looked bad and she said she would fix the other picture. She never called to explain the wrong sized picture.  If so I wouldn't have even worried about it or brought it up.  She didn't apologize or anything.  \nI was going to give a better review because Brian was on top of it but the pictures are the last straw.  Come on!!!!"
0,"Can you say \""Ewwww\""\n\nThe best advice i can give you is for $1 more you can go to the LVH Hotel & Casino Buffet (which is 1 block down off the strip) and get way much better quality food!! \n\nI didnt want to touch anything at this buffet other than the salad and still the lettuce was brown!"
1,"We celebrated my husbands 60th birthday here with good friends, The service was excellent, the food was Delish. We had a large party and the entire staff was wonderful. The place has so many memories we had a blast and closed the place down at the end of the night.Go Go Go."
1,"I would give it a 31/2 probably. With the plethora of Thai places in pittsburgh, I was expecting a little more than average when I went there. The food was decent, but nothing like what I haven't had before.\n\nThere were 6 of us and we had ordered 5 dishes, with 2 more servings of rice, everyone was pretty full. I really really liked the duck dish that we got (it was gingery, forget the name though). The mushrooms were really good in both the chicken and the duck dish (couldn't say the same about the chicken). The pad see eww( I never order pad thai, i usually get this instead so I judge places by how they make these), was ok, a little on the saltier side, but still decent (we had got the vegetarian one so dunno how the meat ones would fair).\n\nAll in all, a good place, I would like to go again sometime. I was  glad it was open on christmas eve."
0,"The flamboyant owner/waiter is really rude. This restaurant is really small and can't fit parties of 10 or more.  The food is good, but since the service was so horrible, I'll never come back."

I'm all for describing your foods but, to who's determent?  \n\nI had the fried shrimp which was delicious but, became a bit too much about the 5th shrimp.  My dining companions all loved their food and drinks but, would have loved a bit more variety when it came to actual dishes."
1,Delicious!!!! The donuts are sooo warm and soft! Lots of different types or frosting and toppings to choose from! More on the heavier side for a donut but very good!!! Loved the caramel frosting with Oreos! Yummmmy!
1,"Creative menu, nice ambiance and great location!"
1,"UPDATE: I pull for business's to make it and I was a bit concernced they might not make it being next door to Starbucks and I do walk past their store to get there.  I have stopped by twice since my last review.  I was concerned because I saw the sign come down and the windows covered with a closed sign for renovations.  Quiznos was in the spot and did the same thing but never reopened.  So, to our surprise they opened and they added another franchise to the yogart shop called Planet Smoothie.  They also added a couple of comfy chairs with a bookshelf of books for people to read. They also added prepackaged snacks like chocolate covered pretzils.  They have several iPads with games kids can play and the kids at heart.  I got this last time pepermint who carob chips, strawberries, and almonds.  My daughter got chocolate on a cone.  The girls that work here are very friendly and offer samples everytime we stop in.  They make crepes too but we have not tried them yet.  I do say the smoothies sound really good but the prices were a little steep for me so I will go to Starbucks for my Frap. (yes I know not healthy)  I am very happy they are adding variety and I hope they stay in my plaza for many years to come."
0,"Apparently, I'm BANNED from this Buffalo Exchange. \n\nHow does one get banned from a Buffalo Exchange?\n\nDid I punch one of the snotty hipsters for not thinking my $200 article of clothing is worth $6? Did I toss over a rack of musty knock off handbags in a fit of rage? Did I curse out a bored looking guy with flippy hair and an ironic mustache?\n\nNope, I wasn't even in the store.\n\nI accidentally sold a pair of pants that my boyfriend didn't want sold. He called immediately (within 20 minutes of me leaving the store) and said that he'd be in the next day to pick them up. He had the receipt, and the assistant manager said that would be okay. Well, upon him arriving at the store to complete this previously agreed upon transaction, the same manager decided this wasn't okay and said that he had to buy the pants at retail price. While I'm leaving out some of the mind boggling back and forth that went on, I'll sum it up as the level of poor customer service and rude behavior displayed by the \""management\"" of the store was shocking. \n\nWhile my boyfriend never raised his voice, lost his cool or got flustered, the manager decided because he made her stand by what she had originally agreed on, he was \""NEVER ALLOWED BACK IN THIS STORE AGAIN\"" \n\n\""OR YOUR GIRLFRIEND EITHER!!!!\""\n\nSo there you have it. Banned from Buffalo Exchange. Funny, I haven't lost any sleep over it."
0,"I went here for a mothers day pamper and the experience was not favorable. I was not spoken to by the tech/ owner during the process. She was ruff and hurt my legs during the massage she rushed through the pedicure and it was not at all enjoyable! I will not be back again!! This was the second time and the last. The time before this there were screaming children in there and it was not relaxing at all!! These places are a dime a dozen around town, however when I go for a pedicure I expect to be treated kindly and not rushed out!!"
0,Some of the most disinterested employees of all time  Bought a ticket to strip hotel and after waiting 20 minutes bus came and I asked the driver if he was going to my hotel just to be sure I was in correct line and he refused to answer me and stared and shrugged his shoulders. I took a cab\nI am surprised these folks are still in business.
1,We love getting take out from Pita Jungle! We love the humus! Yum-yum. And I always get the tabbouleh. I love that it's so tasty and healthy. I also tried the turtle cheesecake recently. I am not really a cheese cake fan but wanted something sweet. It was delicious! \n\nMy only complaint is sometimes they forget things. A couple months ago our order was incomplete. I called to complain and they apologized and said they would refund us some money but they never made the refund. \n\nSo if you get take out from here just check your order before you leave.
0,"First off let me start by saying I did not write a review for the last foodie fest because my boyfriend, daughter, and I all got food poisoning. It was one of the worst experiences of our lives, but we couldn't narrow it down so I didn't want to put any particular truck on blast. The fact that we returned was based on free tickets from yelp (thanks yelp and Red Dragon) and White Castle. I choose not to go to my fav local trucks like fuku, sin city wings, and chi town hustler (who wasn't at this 1, but was at last) because they usually up their prices for the event. Sucks for us locals who are use to their normal prices. But I get it because they have an insane vendor fee of like $900! I'm curious if all trucks even profited with prices like that? \nWe went Friday and arrived at about 4:15-4:30. The line was long so we went to the VIP entrance for our yelp tix. \nUnorganized from the start. I was clearly the first Yelper to check in thru VIP. The lady argued with me and told me I had to go to general admission, until I pulled up the email and showed it to her. Still, they did not have a list of names, and let 3-4 parties in before me. I literally watched the White Castle line get 30 minutes longer as the unorganized employees text for information. \nI finally got in, and went straight to the White Castle line. We waited about an hour to order, and another hour for our food. I took a break and got a lemonade and tornado potato while my bf dealt with the crazies. We ordered a crave crate which is 100 burgers for $100. Between 4 of us we killed about 25 burgers. Lets just say we had no problem getting rid of the rest. However I've had White Castle. From White Castle. They may have brought their grills from Chicago, but the patties were indeed still frozen. And the cheap patties were even a tad undercooked. It wasn't like the real thing, and I know I can't be the only one who feels this way. However, if Las Vegas didn't prove their worth for bringing a real White Castle to our city- the company is freakin' crazy! They sold out of their first batch of 60,000 burgers the first night! GIVE US THE REAL THING WHITE CASTLE!! \nI tasted some BBQ nachos from the Q truck- BOMB. \nOther than that- a fun time but I wouldn't do it again, NOR EVER PAY FULL PRICE! $10 entry then pricy food truck grub? Vegas locals are supporting your scene, expand hours, areas, and LOWER PRICES! Make it worth it for everyone, trucks and customers! \nI can't say I will return to another foodie Fest. It's possible if they do a few things different. Hopefully they'll notice the disappointing yelp reviews and take notes!"
0,"Perfection Plus?  \nPerfection Plus \""what\""?  \nPerfection Plus No Call No Show?  \nTwice?\nHowever you add that up, it still equals a failure to the customer.\nI was going to buy a deal from them on LivingSocial, but wanted to verify that they did in fact do condos (I had seen a previous company's ad that stated that apartments and condos were excluded from the deal). I tried calling them several times through the phone number listed on the deal and I received a greeting which stated:\n\""You have reached... ... ...please leave your message after the tone.\""\n\nFirst red flag.\n\nAfter leaving a message on the third try, it was finally returned later that day. Which I get. Hey, these guys were busy, probably on-site doing what they do. I was assured that they do in fact do condos and the person that I talked to (I believe was Alex?) said that I could just take care of the purchase directly with them for the same price (which saves them from any fees that the social vendor charges). No problem. Supporting local businesses, right?\n\nI scheduled for Saturday, between 10 and 12. 1230 rolls around. No call, no show. I finally reach them and I'm told, \""Sorry, the technician Was actually there, but he noticed that you are on the second floor and he didn't have the right hoses for the job\"". Alright, but shouldn't that have warranted a call to the customer, advising of the issue and at very least, acknowledging that he was there? It seems that instead, the technician was told to move on to the next job. Umm...hello??? What about the job that he was supposed to do? Maybe, oh, I dunno, try to call and reschedule with the previous customer for when you have the right tools to do the job? What's that called?...oh yeah, courtesy.\n\nAnyway. I rescheduled for Tuesday, between 10 and 12. Here we are, Tuesday, after 1230.  \nNo call, no show.  \nI tried to call them again, but after receiving the completely unpersonalized/unprofessional \""business\"" message greeting, I just have better things to do. Like, write a review about my experience, since I took time out of my day to be home for these guys. Twice.\n\nI will point out that someone called me back about 20 minutes later, \""just returning the call from this number\"". When I explained that I wanted to cancel my service, due to \""no call, no show...Again\"", the person sounded surprised about my scheduled service. He seemed nice and all, but I've moved on and advised that I am canceling the service request. In hindsight, I really should have read more reviews about this company (and it's quite likely that the positive reviews here may be from friends/family/etc). Sure, there may be a few kudos in here, but in comparison to the issues filed with the BBB, I'm skeptical, to say the least.

0,"I have been to the Southern many times but there had been a long gap until I revisited last night.\n\nUnfortunately I was very disappointed. My two favourite dishes that I usually choose from when I visit The Southern, The Red Squirrel or Holyrood 9A are the Halloumi burger or the Haggis burger. Last night I went for halloumi. \n\nWhen it arrived I instantly noticed that there was a fair bit less halloumi in than I have had on previous visits. Not only that but it was considerably burnt. The bun was also incredibly crusty and flaked everywhere. I ate most of it because I was starving.\n\nWhen the waitress came along to clear our table she asked if everything was OK so i told her my halloumi was burnt, she went and gave my feedback to the chef then gave us 10% off our bill. This was a very decent gesture and I do like the place. The food was simply just not up to scratch.\n\nI will return if I'm in the neighbourhood and hopefully things will improve."
0,"Normally I would give this place maybe 3/4 stars, but today we went to buy food to make breakfast and everything is fine until we got home. We cooked out food and my boyfriend took a bite if our breakfast sandwiches and thought the Jimmy Dean sausage tasted weird, well it's been expired for 6 days!!! There should be no reason that a store sales anything past expiration especially meat products!!! This is the job of Walmart and their employees to check these things. Guess we'll have to keep an eye out if we even continue shopping here and we will be going back to talk to a manager."
0,"This place was only okay. DO NOT go during \""happy hour\"" when they are about to close, when things are half off. They are half off for a reason, they taste awful, and I would not be surprised if you get food poisoning from it. Even the soy sauce tasted bad. I went there before not during happy hour also, and it was just alright."
0,"OVERPRICED for what you get on the plate...plus, Mexican food just tastes better when the place plays more \""cultural\"" music is decorated acoordingly"
0,"What once was an amazing hotel has gone down the toilet!   \n\nI stayed here in the 80's and it was a beautiful hotel at that time.  Lavishly decorated, huge pool and beautiful rose gardens that were from the original owner, Bugsy.   \n\nThis last trip we decided to go here for lunch and check out the hotel.  The carpet as well as the rest of the hotel looks like it hasn't been cleaned since the 80's!   The original pool is gone, as well as Bugsy's Rose Gardens.   This place has lost all of it's charm.   Lunch was terrible, service was even worse.     \n\nI am just so happy we didn't stay here, because if they can't even take care of the main part of the hotel, I can only imagine the state the rooms would be in.   \n\nThe time has come to just tear this hotel down."
1,"The sonic here makes an awesome milkshake. Fast food milkshakes are hit or miss but they've been hits here. The problem is, it's 10:22 PM and I've been sitting here in the drive thru for the past 20 minutes. The good news, coconut cream pie shake is delicious. Be patience or leave, your call."
1,"A dish of shrimp and salmon, honest. It's worth the suggestion. If dinner, choose the low tables of the high tables side of the bar, which besides small, are in an environment where the music is high"
1,"This is our new favorite breakfast place. Try the biscuits and warm strawberry compote, so good!  The staff are very friendly and helpful and the service is fast."
0,"I don't recomend this restaurant; poor service, no customer service they don't give you water unless you ask for it, and when about time to pay and were waiting for our change and waiting and waiting they ignore us to give our change until we just left the restaurant. SMH"
1,"Chris is a God-send! Literally! I found him in the church bulletin and went there in need of major auto repairs. My 2002 Chevy Trailblazer has a lot of miles on it and all the original parts are starting to fall apart. He does free diagnostics and doesn't charge a huge labor cost. He doesn't make up problems with your car just to get the business. And if you bring in the parts, he discounts the labor cost. Very fair. Very nice man and his staff is super cool as well. I highly recommend him. I have been super happy with his service."
0,"I make terrible pancakes and could have done a better job than this place. After reading about this place in Phoenix Magazine touting the Reece's pancakes, I was stoked to find another breakfast place in the Valley to try. Boy was I disappointed. The overpriced pancakes were the consistency and dryness of microwave pancakes and instead of having the candies mixed in, they were just on top of the dry mess. The tomatoes were not fresh (for my tomatoes and cottage cheese) and the rest of our guests had similar dry and uninspiring food. The service was great and the lack of wait was really nice on a Sunday. Parking is horrific since it's near the Ice Den."
1,"This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. And ive traveled a lot. So I know what good hotels are. \nThe staff is amazing! I have really, never met more kind and considerate staff. They go the extra mile to make sure you are comfortable there.\nWe got slammed and put in a horrible situation and they understood it and made us never want to leave.\nEspecially the day my cat got out of our room. She was lost, and all the staff left their posts to help us find her. And they did! They got her back to me!\nAfter I was trying to relax by the fireplace Corey at the front desk personally made me, my husband and my mother all hot chocolate with caramel and whip cream! \nWhen they were supposed to charge us an extra $10 in Sunday night, they gave us the room free. Just so many little things that they don't have to do, but make a difference!\nAs far as rooms go, they are clean, spacious and comfortable. I was homeless for a week and stayed here and felt okay with that!\nI would though get an upstairs room because after 5 nights, a horribly obnoxious family was put above us and they were crazy loud! Even then, we called the front desk about it and the next thing we know they all are outside playing. Which is better than upstairs.\nCan't blame the hotel for the guests!\nBut we didn't hear any of our next door neighbors!\nPlease stay here! It's amazing!"
0,"Not impressed, especially given the reputation that it's a great place. It started with not being able to sit in the main room and we got taken down a long hall in a secluded room full of booths, with a loud fan and a dark, lonesome, secluded setting. The space between the table and bench is quite large so makes it awkward being so far from your food. The spicy cheese bread was about the only thing that gets a 3/4 star. Otherwise, the food was just crummy- Mozzerella sticks, Cesar salad (served with ginormous portions of dressing), pizza was bland with dry and hard crust and littler cheese and the Monday pasta special was just pasta, nothing special and could be made at home much better. Several of the pasta dishes came with very little sauce and the server came sparingly to check on us, and didn't even make it to run the check and we paid up front. The only thing that made this experience is being with family, and that was the point of going out for dinner!"
0,"LAME.  LAME! LAME! Went with my significant other, couldn't help myself from laughing all the way through this...at all the bad acting and role playing we were expected to participate in.  Ridiculous waste of time and money.  Spent the whole time trying to find a way to exit / escape.  Was like a bad dream that you knew was just a dream, but you couldn't wake up from.  Should've known better when there was no one in line from the start."
1,"Love Chipotle.  My only criticism is that some of the people making the burritos and tacos and such don't know what they're doing.  Sometimes, they aren't listening to what I am saying or they're very conservative on the portions, or they're just too slow.  I come here quite often and know who does a good job and who just gets in the way.  No matter what, whoever is at the register is always very nice....The place is always clean....Sometimes there's a line, but if the right people are making the food, then it doesn't take that long.  Love the burritos."
0,"Had the Maine Lobster Pot Pie and the Shrimp and Scallops for entrees. Crab cakes for appetizer. We do not get it. The Pot Pie was a neat and cool presentation but that was it. All tastes were just weird and sometimes unpleasant, the food overall was a disappointment with a capital D. The service was struggling to not be fake and the night was just not one of our better dinners in Vegas. We have been to a few Michael Mina restaurants and it seems to be the same at all of them. Not up to standards of other Vegas celebrity chef, high end restaurants. Really disappointed. Cost was only 30.00 dollars less then Gordon Ramsay's and no where near the experience."
1,ive been in here many times with my brother helping him fix up his ( 09-yzf r6s ) and if you whant to find good prices this is one of the best places in the valley to go to .  but this guy  eugene t.  here with his  bs  review  its cause he must not have a bike and is nothing more than a troubel maker  with  no  huevos to  seek the staff in extreme yamaha  so he should maybe stay away from there  cause we already have enough squids in scottsdale and the phoenix area so find a new toy buddy like a scotter and  chill out at mill ave where you belong.
1,"We went into this restaurant our first night in Las Vegas, after driving from Oceanside, CA, and checking into our hotel. I had done my research on the place before the Vegas trip with my wife and kid, and decided to give it a shot. We arrived there at around 6:30pm on a Sunday, and there was no wait for us to be seated- awesome! We got seated, and found out that since my kid is 2 years old, she gets to eat the all-you-can-eat for free! So, my wife and I both got AYCE, and ordered for the three of us. The sushi tasted fresh, and was brought out in a timely manner, which was surprising since the place was packed. There were some rolls that you can only have once, like the no-name roll, and the Ellen roll and, boy, were they good! We ended with some ice cream, and it was delicious as well. \nA few things to note: \n- Our bill came up to $60 after tax and tip for 2 people. Not bad for the quality of sushi that you got. \n- You can order anything from the menu, and some things you can only order one per person (Ellen and no-name rolls). We could have gotten three each of those (since there were three of us), but decided not to. I'm not sure if the restaurant employees are strict on that policy, but we didn't try to test it. \n- The restaurant has a no wasting rule. If you, for example, decide to eat the fish only in your sushi rolls, and don't want to eat the rice, then you get charged... Again, I'm not sure if the restaurant enforces this, but it's stated on the menu. \n- We only got one menu for our table. It was kind of difficult for us to try to stare at one menu with our 2-year old being interested in using the menu as a toy as well. I guess it's the norm here, because all the other tables we looked at had one menu. \n- They gave us our check before we were done eating. My wife wanted more ice cream, and we asked for it as we were handing over my credit card. Needless to say, it was a bad decision to pay and then ask for more food. We never got our ice cream, after waiting a while, writing in the tip and signing, and just deciding to leave. \nThis place still gets a 5-star review despite the shortcoming on the ice cream. Perhaps they were doing us a favor, because we left there stuffed! We'll probably be back the next time we visit Las Vegas. It was thoroughly enjoyable."
0,"Awful awful awful awful. It's a damn shame that the steel city's most famous landmark eatery is staffed by people who are too lazy to do their damn job. Was seated at a table and waited for twenty minutes without speaking to anyone from the wait staff. Tried to order from the to go line and was rebuked since we had a table. Moved to the bar to order, waited for the jackass behind the bar to get back to his job when a commercial came on (sorry to pull you away from the chiefs game). The sandwich was mediocre at best, just a gimmick of putting soggy fries on a run of the mill deli sandwich. If anyone is looking to open a legitimately remarkable sandwich joint, Pittsburgh is prime realty."
0,"My best friend and I decided to do a double date with our boyfriends who are also really good friends. We even found a groupon deal!\nWhen we walked in, I was impressed with how nice it looked. The girl, Alex, at the front was very rude and monotone. She seemed liked a classic snooty spoiled scottsdale girl. \nThere was a deal going on 2 for $25, appetizer and two entrees. The four of us all ordered at the same time. My boyfriend and I got our appetizer what seemed like only minutes later. And it was more on the cold side. My friend did not receive her appetizer until ten minutes later when her meal arrive along side it. I did not receive my meal for another 10 minutes which was the pesto chicken pasta and a side caesar. I went to take a bite out of my caesar (mind you, it already being dark inside the theatre at this point) and was shocked to be eating dry ice berg lettuce. I pressed my button and five minutes later a guy came up and apologized and asked if I wanted to keep this salad and just bring out the dressed or an entirely new salad. I said I want a Caesar salad, I want the real deal, dressing and all. And he says :ok I'll be right back with the dressing.\"" Nooooo. This isn't even the right lettuce, there's no parmesan and there's tomatoes in this salad. But he was long gone before I could say anything. When he came back I told him again that i want the correct salad. He gave me lip and said with attitide, \""I thought i asked you that. I'll go get you a new salad.\"" You did, and you failed  to listen to a what I asked. \nAlso, the food is very cheap quality with a high price tag. \nManagement really needs to educate their employees on what customer service truly is."
0,Atmosphere is neat.. Will give them 2 star ONLY for the great bands they bring but their breakfast SUCKS! Food came out cold! Not Luke warm.. Not warm.. COLD! C'mon?! Really!? How can you eff up breakfest!?  Skip this place for eating and just go for the live music and good happy hour ..
1,"This tiny and quaint mom-and-pop's style breakfast place is easy to overlook, but served one of the nicest breakfasts I've had in a long time.  I had the Pancake combo with french toast instead and it was DELICIOUS.  The syrup tasted natural and the toast tasted homemade- fluffy and not greasy.  The bacon was perfect and the coffee was pretty nice too.  Wonderful service, attentive and so polite.  I wish I was a local so I could go there every weekend!  A perfect breakfast stop on the way home from Las Vegas."
0,"Not impressed by the seating staff, particularly the Manager. They might be to used to how Vegas customers are? Maybe they don't care because they get enough business they didn't need ours? Either way I felt really sorry for my sister and the situation we had come from here. We traveled from Riverside, Ca to celebrate the weekend with my niece for her 21st birthday. My sister kept assuring me she'd heard of this place Ellis Island that was to be fabulous. I went along with it even though, who the hecks even heard of this place? I took the family on a site seeing walk and joined them at the casino. I attemped to put our name in and was not accepted because of the amount of people in our party. What??? Who doesn't want business? Who doesn't want to work with an obviously anxious group? Who condones such behavior? Yes, we did travel in a group of 16 but when ever we've traveled before we've never been turned away. I will admit I didn't behave with the best of attitude either at this point because of the hostility and unwillingness to work with us. They were saying they only seat of to 8, and we could break into 2 groups but being seated up to 35 mins apart and not even on the same side. Really?\nAfter we were finally seated in 4 parties of 4, my party on the whole other side out of view of the rest of us, I asked for the manager! Let me tell you don't waste your time. He litterally told me he wouldn't of seated us and was trying to convey we should just be happy were seated. I had to leave, I couldn't contribute money into an place that treats customers like this. I left our family there and felt horrible for ruining what was to be my nieces 21st luncheon with her family from California-Utah...I had to taxi it back to the hotel since I had been on foot and was getting a ride back originally. And when you have a husband, 9 year old and 2 year old and try to get a taxi it really was the icing on the cake.\n\nSo word to the wise, only go there if you have 4 or less because that seems all they like."
0,"This will be a two part revue...both not good.\n\nFirst the Bistro...have been here two times now and both times a little let down.  The first time the only thing that saved the night was good company, good wine and some quality champagne.  If you get a chance to sample some Nectar Imperial Rose definitely do so...best champagne I have ever had.  The second night, nothing really saved it.  I chose to do the Kobe Beef Steak...a $90 plate.  Very let down.  Yes it's American Kobe and I knew it was not going to be at the level of some Kobe I have had outside the US, but this was just bad.  I have had marinated skirt steaks that cost $15 that were better.  No one in my party was overly thrilled about any of their food, just not worth the money.\n\nPart two...the nightclub.  After dinner we were given free passes in to the Club and I have never seen a place so packed.  I guess that's a good thing if you are looking to literally rub all over people and push your way through crowds to just get a drink.  Get Bottle Service it might be worth the $800 for the night just so you get your own space."
0,Panda Express quality food at 4 times the price.
1,"Good food here, this place knows how to make good asian food and in my opinion,  makes the best crab ragoon in the city"
1,"One if my favorite Korean restaurants here in Vegas. Love the BBQ ribs and garlic squid! I Always bring my family and friends here to get some grub, plus they are closer to my house."
0,"Each day I put on these glasses I'm reminded of the unsatisfactory service and finished product received here. Very nice store and front desk person, very nice Dr. V and support person Rita... but OMG the lab they use just sucks. First return to try on my new glasses, I couldn't see. Second visit 10 days later... better but still not able to leave with them. Third visit I reluctantly took them because Rita let me know my 30 return period was about up. Are you kidding me??? They've never even left the store!!! Again, very nice people, cool store, good inventory... but a disappointing experience."
0,"The MGM Signature is located close to the Las Vegas airport which means it is about a half hour drive to where all the action is at... I booked this hotel because I knew I had to pick up friends at the airport and it would be convenient in that sense, and also because we had a large party and were planning to have limo service everywhere we were going. Otherwise, if you are walking or driving, I would stay elsewhere.\n\nFirst, when we arrived, I was pretty annoyed that there were only two people checking in guests. I waited about 20 minutes and there was only one party ahead of me. Very slow service. We finally got checked in and went up to our suites... I booked a one-bedroom with an adjoining junior suite and was very disappointed to see that they weren't connected. I called the front desk to which they explained \""Oh... I'm sorry... we adjoin our suites through the foyer entrance in the front\"" meaning they aren't connected by a door through the connecting walls but that both of our rooms had a separate entrance but if you left the doors open, they were now \""adjoined.\"" I guess they justified this because outside of our two separate doors, there was a double door entrance that you could still close off to the public so that when we left our doors open, we would still have privacy, but still... it was just a really weird and inconvenient design!\n\nI didn't have any problems with hotel services... we got clean towels, extra blankets, sheets, and pillows with no problem at all. They did say they don't have cots though so basically, there are only two beds per room no matter what size of a suite you book. In our one-bedroom, there was only one king bed and there wasn't a choice of having two queens instead. The pros of this hotel are: 2 bathrooms in a one-bedroom (very large bathrooms with flat screens and a jazuzzi tub), huge fridge, fully stocked kitchen with utensils and pots, easy access to MGM, and huge balcony. However, for the price, I would have easily picked a hotel that had a better location and bigger rooms."
1,Great happy hour with kids.  Really enjoyed the quality food and refreshingly attentive service.
1,Had a rueben the other day. Great sandwich!  Tons of meat and kraut. Delicious and really filled me up!
1,"This is a hidden gem in snottsdale....\n\nHUGE wine menu, borderline overwhelming, but the waitress was particularly helpful with narrowing down the selection based on your palette.\n\nWe went on a Friday, and there was a reggae band playing, um, yes please!  A very un-pretentious hangout, good diverse crowd.  The food is a bit expensive, but the egyptian flatbreads are big enough to share, so completely reasonable."
1,"I absolutely love Dr. Liaw, she is very thorough, detailed, and takes her time explaining things to you.  She is just the friendliest person, I'll definitely be back to se Dr. Liaw. I don't think you can get better care anywhere else."
1,"Cozy, classy, casual and couches! Cheese and champagne! (Ok the last two are also Cs, but they didn't really fit the alliteration scheme.)\n\nUncorked really has everything I like. Great place to bring friends or a date. I can wear jeans and a t-shirt or a dress with heels and don't feel out of place either way.\n\nI love the wine ($5 off glasses and flights on Monday? Yes, thank you!). And the cheese plates, while seemingly pricey at $17, are loaded with enough tasty treats to feed two people as a meal.\n\nNot only is it not snobby, but it's not a hassle like many places in Scottsdale are. It's tucked away in the back of a shopping complex. There is plenty of parking and even when the place is full it's not loud and crowded.\n\nI've been coming here since the grand opening and will continue to as long as they keep the wine flowing and the cheese... doing whatever cheese does. Great place to relax, hang out, and get your food and drink on."
1,Jody is truly a pleasure to work with. I had her do some marketing for my mom's catering business and she excelled every expectation. She's personable and easy to work with. I can't imagine doing business with anyone else for these matters!
1,They are a small family run great Italian restaurant. I went with my family and we all loved it. If you go try the chicken Parma it was the best I ever had
0,"I went here recently, and I had a spinach and cheese omelet.  A strange thing happened in the kitchen though, something kind of like the fog that turns you inside out, I suspect.  When my omelet came out it was actually a spinach omelet with a bit of egg and cheese tucked inside.  Wow, that is so crazy........oh and gross.  I am not Popeye, nor am I a rabbit, therefore playing a game of find the egg and cheese in a spinach haystack is not awesome dudes.  FAIL."
1,"I knew that going to Bar Masa during restaurant week would be my one shot to eat there (though the $49 early menu is there all the time, just found that out!)\n\nMy friend Susan D. and I made reservations for Saturday night at 7 PM.  Sporting my brand new crazily blingy sparkly new shoes, I trounced through Aria with anticipation.  We were escorted by our beaus, who trotted off to the Aria buffet while we went in search of opulence.\n\nWe were seated in this stunning restaurant, with lights hanging from the ceiling and red accents everywhere.  Our server was Chase.  I started off with a Jalapeno Ja cocktail (house made jalepeno vodka with lime and muddled cucumber, garnish: 2 slices of Persian cucumber on a toothpick) and Susan opted for the Kyoto Cheers (soju, lychee, pomengranate).\n\nOur 3 course meal: we both started off with tuna-yellowtail ceviche (normally $28 on the menu!), then each got the 10 piece sushi sampler at Chase's recommendation (over $70 if ordered a la carte), and then for dessert Susan ordered the miso creme brulee and I ordered the yuzu sorbet.\n\nThe ceviche: cubed maguro and hamachi, grated daikon, fresh snipped chives, tiny diced raw jalepeno with a yuzu-esque sauce.  Scrumptious!\n\nOur chef's choice sushi: 2 pieces of chu-toro, 2 pieces hamachi belly, 2 pieces of tai, 2 pieces nama sake, and 2 pieces amaebi (no heads).  Someone had a heavy hand with wasabi on the fish (okay to Susan, a bit too much for me).  The toro was a surprise for this type of menu.  Tai was too tough.  Amaebi was something special.  A very nice chef's choice for sure.\n\nWe ordered a few things off the menu before getting to dessert (so yes, this did not end up as just $50 per person!) - Susan ordered the peking duck and foie gras fried rice - I tried it and it was very tasty.  I got one piece saba (smoky, unusual flavor), one piece anago (sea eel, hard to find but nothing exciting), and uni (small but very fresh and flavorful - POW in my mouth!).\n\nThen, Susan peer pressured me into another cocktail!  Still thinking of my gal Jaime W. and our spicy drink pursuits, I went for spicy drink #2 with Bacardi O, yuzu juice, fresh mint and floating shichimi togarashi pepper flakes.  \n\nFinally we made it to dessert.  Her miso creme brulee was very tasty, but my yuzu sorbet (which actually was more like a granita) was outstanding, bright citrus-y with a sprinkle of mint.  Overall, great food and service - big plus to the generous offerings for restaurant week and getting about 55% off the price of what we had.  Now that I spent on myself what it would cost 4 people at Blue Fin, it is back to my joint after this!"
0,"Aria is by far the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. \n\nhere are some reasons why:\n\n- took an hour to check in\n- booked a room with double queen, but was told its not available and was instead given a king with a roll in\n- carpet in the room was stained with white spots all over\n- vent above toilet in the bathroom was not closed, exposing all kinds of pipes and etc.\n- remote to control entire room does not work\n- 45 minutes to reach the front desk\n- spoke to the manager and was upgraded to a \""sky suite\"". waited another 1+ hour to get set up in our new \""sky suite\""\n- \""sky suite\"" room turns out to be the same size as our regular room, just a farther walk from the elevator in another tower.\n- was told keys were transferred over\n- keys didn't work, got new keys. second set of keys didn't work.\n- ended up with 12 keys that didn't work. locked out of room in the middle of the night\n- employees don't know where anything is and don't try to figure it out. instead they just say \""sorry i don't even know...\"" instead of \""i don't know but let me find out for you\"" \n- horrible service at cafe, we asked to move one table over because we had 1 person joining us at a 4 person table and they denied us because that section was \""closed\"" even though the table was 2 ft away.\n\n\ni do understand that they are new but at least train your employees to know the layout of the casino before you open?\n\nalso to the guy complaining about no DVR, i don't know which hotels you've stayed at but i've never seen hotels with DVR. \n\nalso the entrance to the crystals mall is 10 ft away from the aria door so its not that far of a walk in crazy weather conditions..\n\nthe remote in the room is very straight forward, the person saying it takes a tech genius to operate it is obviously just complaining to complain."
0,"A friend of mine just went here and told me about a bad guest service experience she had. I remembered my review and the update I have. \n\nI was contacted by the manager and he apologized. Which was all I wanted. He offered to send me a gift card that I could print out from my email. Which was really going above and beyond to make it up to me. However I never received that email. \n\nI don't want to sound like I'm trying to get anything for free, but if you offer something to someone you already screwed over you should probably follow through."
0,Next time a bartender wants to talk smack about the customers make sure it's not within ears length...what's the big deal about getting separate tabs? Sorry I had to make you work P.S Ryan the server is amazing he's super sweet
0,"I used to like this place.  I remember the first time I came here, on New Year's Eve, and the food was excellent.  So was the service.  The server even let my friend take home a bottle of the special plum sauce because he liked it so much.\n\nHowever, both the food and service have gotten worse and worse and now I never want to eat here again.  First, I realized they put MSG in the food unless you tell them not to.  Wha?  Should flavorful, spicy Thai food need MSG?  And it labels itself as a healthy, vegetarian friendly place.  The service is poor, it takes forever to get your food, and when you do get it you are invariably disappointed.  \n\nLast time I ordered Vegetarian Pad Si Ew (normally my favorite Thai dish.  I love the Chinese broccoli and yummy sauce).  Figured since it was a vegetarian dish it would probably have tofu for protein, right?  Wrong!  It had no protein except a few small beans.  It was also made with American broccoli, and the sauce tasted weird.  It tasted like it had MSG in it, even though I requested none.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is also quite weird.  It's located in Commercial Center, within walking distance of Lotus of Siam... so just go there instead!"
1,"If you've never been to a Jimmy John's, you probably hate fast and fresh sandwiches.  \n\nThis location is even better than every other JJs I've been to.  It has a drive-thu!  Seriously!  I'll bet it took me less than two minutes to order, get my food, and drive away.\n\nIf you love sandwiches, you have to love JJs...it really is the go-to.\n\n\nTry:  The Italian Night Club\n\nAvoid:  Forgetting to ask for the hot peppers"
0,"I don't even know how to describe how I felt here. Within 2 minutes of leaving the parking garage, we all knew we had made a mistake. I know that Fremont Street provides the nostalgia of \""old Vegas,\"" but it encases all the parts of the city that I can happily do without. In the 30 minutes we wandered around here, I saw more prostitutes and cracked out people than I saw in my whole 5 days on the strip. It was just flat-out awkward.\n\nI agree with the other reviewers that this is a much more low-maintenance spot to drink and gamble in Vegas, but if you're a fan of the more modern, visually pleasing and less tacky Vegas, stick to the strip."
1,Best Pool Party on a Sunday Afternoon! I always come here when I go to Vegas with my girls! We always have the time of our life. Last time we were here was on a Labor day weekend. They have various pools to choose from and the atmosphere is just great. Next time I will definitely be staying here so that I won't have to wait in line for 2 hours!
0,"Overrated.\n\nOkay so I've only heard about this place and the \""frozen hot chocolate\"" so many times... so I thought for a really long time that this place was like a bakery or cafe that served drinks and dessert.\n\nSo when I finally came with a few coworkers and saw the menu of burgers and hot dogs, I was slightly disappointed. Other disappointments:\n\n- Insane wait. 45 minutes for a table of 5\n- Frozen hot chocolate. It was good, but not $15 good\n- The food. Though tasty, so greasy and made me feel sick for the rest of the night\n- The presentation of the food. I think they're trying to come off as boutique, but it's just inconvenient and inefficient to eat your food from one large dish when you have six other small dishes of individual condiments around you. It's fine if you're by yourself, but when you're at a table with 4 other people and they also have 4 other dishes besides their main dish, you fight for elbow space\n- The scary baby. This isn't S3's fault, but there was a baby who was staring straight at us with no expression. It was freaky, man\n\nI mean, come on now. $15 for a foot-long hot dog? I don't care how awesome that hot dog was (it wasn't that great) or that we're in Las Vegas or if you serve it on a foot-long dish that holds it perfectly. No hot dog is worth more than a $1 per inch. It's a hot dog, aka, blended leftover parts from animals. I'd rather buy two hot dogs from Costco AND get two drinks!"
0,"When They scale the seafood with 1/4lb of water with it! Ask for scale again they refuse to do it! Complain to manager, and said that how it is because so cheap!! That's not the right way to do the business! So I give up whole shopping cart n left! ! Not honest to costumer."
0,"I've tried everything in the store so far so this hopefully can give you an honest review about what I've thought. (all in my opinion)\n\nBath Salts - tubes are too small to really feel any sort of difference in the bath, and the scent wont be noticeable once you are soaking. \n\nSoaps - I have found no luck with ANY of their facial soaps. All of them do the same thing - dry out my skin. All of the Glycerin soaps smell great in the store, but once used, there is no scent and they are very drying. Lush's soaps BY FAR outshine Basin. No contest. Speaking of which, most soaps are claimed to be hand made by the company but I have seen many soaps sold by another company called Primal Elements. suspicious. plus, the soaps are cut super inconsistent. There's normally a salesperson at the front cutting fresh soaps but some soaps will be cut very big (costing almost $10 a soap) where as I've tried to pick up others and they are barely over $4 and there are no bigger pieces to select from. Their signs say $5.99 and very small say per 100 g but I figure if your sign sys 5.99 thats the price your products should be. \n\nAll Bath Extras (ie massagers, bath pillows, soap dishes etc.) - Def bought whole sale... Which is kind of a shame when the sales people tell you they are a family owned business, you expect homemade products to an extent.\n\nBath Bombs - Oils in them are DEF noticable in the tub, smells are great and come in a vast variety from light scents like Calm Waters and Twilight, to their heavily scented Sastuma and Hidden Treasures. Being a Lush user, which most people would find the store quite similar, I have to say I'm not impressed with the scents. The one thing that keeps me buying Lush is the lingering scents that I literally can smell in my bathroom for days after a soak. This being said I will continue to use Lush accompanied with some extra oils and I will easily have had a better product than Basins. Not Impressed. \n\nLip Scrub - I like this one better than other lip scrubs I have found. They seem to have more oils in them which helps to keep the product cleaner in application. However, for 8.99/each. I'll make my own. Here are the ingredients. Raw Sugar, Olive Oil, Avocado Butter, and Flavorings. Easily homemade for a heck of a lot cheaper. \n\nChapsticks - once again, definitely bought wholesale. Their lip balms (and i've bought a couple) are too glossy. I bought a lime one for a male friend of mine and he refused to use it. $5 lip balm, wasted. \n\nSolid Moisturizers - I'm gonna say, this really is one of their better products. BUT make sure you are getting the one with the TAMANU oil in it. The smaller ones they sell at their other stores do NOT have the tamanu oil in them and those products seem lack luster. Wish they had better scents in this product though, being as their are only four. Almond Coconut is what I bought (and two actually because of the $4 discount you get) and it smells NOTHING like almond coconut. Sickeningly sweet, and to think I spent $30 for two. If you like the scents get it.... if not, dont get conned. \n\nSpa Wax - 32$!!!!!! WAY overpriced for only being Soy bean oil and Avocado Butter. Product works great though, I will admit. One winter I had EXTREMELY dry and itchy skin... one night I heated the little guy up and rubbed it on my skin... the next day my skin was soft and smooth.. BUT.... i haven't used it since.. that was 8 months ago.. I havent necessarily had a need for it. \n\nBody Butters - Love them. They melt in the summer, but throw them in the fridge for a cpl hours and they are back to the great consistency. VERY EXPENSIVE. $18 each... but I always buy more... \n\nShampoo and Conditioner Bars - Conditioner bars are an absolute waste. Don't bother spending the $8 for one... they do nothing for your hair. But the Shampoo Bars are another story. The only one I have found luck with is the Iced Cherries. other ones just seem to be very drying and not as desirable... plus the iced cherries smells absolutely divine. \n\nMositurizers, Showers Gels, and \""Foaming\"" Baths - Honestly the Shower Gels and Foaming baths feel like the same product with just a different name. Sad. Mositurizers are HIGHLY overpriced. $17 and barely 8 oz. Not worth it... not in the least. \n\nMilk Baths - GREAT product. Another very expensive thing for only a Bubble Bath ($20) and its always a hit or miss getting it in the store. Sales people always say 'one of the ingredients is on back order' or something like that, but it seems like they just don't know how to order enough to keep the store stocked. this has happened to me on 3 separate visits. \n\nBody Scrub - best product in the store but WAY too big. I always have to order off line cause I cannot take it in carry-on which ends up making the product cost more. major bummer... but it always seems worth the buy. this is my regular buy on my visits."
0,"I had taken my dog to my regular vet twice last week.  Her condition was deteriorating quickly - but the vet seemed to think it was only a urinary tract infection.  Well, mean time,  I was having to force feed her and dump liquids down her throat to hydrate her.  By Saturday evening, however, it was obvious that she was going down.  She was so weak, she could barely get up on all 4's and just as hard a time walking.\n\nI called University Animal Hospital in Tempe that evening, but they were all booked up, but they gave me the number of this clinic, which has a 24 hour emergency operation going.  So, I took her to this place.  I had the feeling driving over there that this would be the last night I would see my dog alive, but I contained it in the hopes that perhaps they could find out what was wrong with her.\n\nWell, my hopes were basically dashed when I was presented an estimate of almost 2 grand just to find out what is wrong with her.  I knew it was something serious, the \""easy\"" stuff had been eliminated.  All kinds of tests, the vet basically stated that at the end of them, it would undoubtedly end up with either heart disease or some form of cancer - they had done an ultrasound on the dog and found fluid around the lungs but also her stomach was greatly enlarged because of the fluids building up.  \n\nI had no choice.  I could have taken her home to die, I guess, but I thought it more humane to have her put down and out of her misery.  So, I was left with my dog for as long as I wanted to say goodbye to her, which I did.  The vet came back in later and asked if I needed more time.  No, I replied, I do not, it's time to get this over with.\n\nShe pulled a syringe out of her pocket and stated that it was basically an overdose of a sedative and that she would just fall asleep.  I dreaded the moment she started injecting it, my doggy was going to die.  I stroked her fur while the fluid moved through her system and then, she moved to a laying down position, closed her eyes - and then opened them again  and that was that.  The vet said a few minor muscle contractions would occur, but that would be it.\n\nWell, that was NOT it.  Her eyes were open the whole time  - no idea if she could see me or not, I was still petting her and saying good bye.  A few minor muscle contractions and - half a minute, 10 seconds, I don't know what - passed and suddenly she opened her mouth VERY wide and let out a screech.  Her mouth closed and then she did it again, same thing.  The vet was like: oh, I better put some more fluid in her.  \n\nMy dog needlessly suffered in a scenario that should have been routine for a vet.  I don't know if that dog was suffering pain to let out the screeches or if she was terrified or both, but it is a sight I will never forget.  The dog was not given enough of the fluid and that is totally and completely unacceptable.  Needless to say I will never use this place again, though I only went there because my normal place was booked up.\n\nI gave the place 2 stars instead of one for one reason: the entire staff was extremely empathetic to me about my doggy having to be put down.  I was a train wreck, crying and shedding tears.  The vet screwed up, but at least she wasn't cold and calculated about it, they do care about the animals and their owners at that place.  I just can't get the image of my dog screeching in pain/horror at the very end of her life."
0,"To say this is a shady dealership would be a complete understatement. I would highly advise against anyone considering buying a new car from this dealer. Don't waste your time, buyer beware!"
0,The woman who answered my call was very rude! Nuff said.
1,"Shame on me for not coming here sooner. The truth is though, I thought this place was a militant vegan place that would smell the seafood-eating fear in me if I dared to walk through the place. (I'm serious) It turned out to be this sunny looking place with abundant seating.\n\nUnlike others I was with, who favoured the revered dragon bowl, I wanted to venture out and got me a Macro Bowl. It was delish but I admit, I like seaweed (wakame) in its natural state and then they had me at the miso-tahini sauce, which is a super combo in my opinion.\n\nWe ordered a banana chocolate pie to split, and as a crust-head (yes I've coined a new term for those who enjoy crust) it was yummy, pie was a bit too sweet but the smooth and creaminess was very WOW, and I am glad that we split it four ways, otherwise, I would have been groaning the way home. \n\nOne of the best parts of the meal I think is how awesome the server was, I don't know her name, but she was not only attentive to our water needs, but she was friendly and non-pushy.  She also was honest about her favourites when asked, and seemed very genuine. We also had a baby at the table, and she provided the baby chair thingy no questions asked, (can you tell I wasn't the mother? hahaha \""thingy\"").  Overall I had a lovely time here, and will definitely come back for MOAR!\n\nRumour also has it that they have a beautiful terrace, but I didn't venture there."
1,Our go to restaurant whenever we are Las Vegas. We love the wine selection and the food is always soooo good. Never had a bad meal.
1,"I highly recommend visiting Abbi at the salon. She was a stylist at the Metro Center location and when they closed, I followed her. I have been a loyal client for over 5 years because she is really good at what she does! If you're a first time customer there are usually coupons in the Ulta fliers."
0,"I've been here twice so far and it was mediocre at best both times. \n\nService is absolutely terrible. They take forever to take your order, and the woman is incredibly rude. She never gave us menus and when we asked for them she told us to just tell her what we want. The dishes we got were really gross and looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a while. \n\nThe actual food itself is mediocre. For a little more money, you could go somewhere else and get something that is 20 times better. I ordered the eggs and corned beef hash -- the egg (because it was only one) was a tiny portion, and the corn beef hash tasted like what I imagine dog food tastes like. \n\nThe only thing I like about this place is that it's relatively cheap and their pancakes are huge. One pancake is definitely enough for a person. \n\nI can't even say you get what you pay for because even though its cheap, it's pretty bad."
0,"This little hole in the wall was recommended by the concierge at the Arizona Biltmore, since we were looking for some authentic Mexican food.  Sometimes a little Taco stand should be just that, a taco stand! \n\nHiding in a huge building, though the building may be bustling and alive during the day, at night it is very dead quiet. We should have known when we walked in and there was NO one around, and the security guard was just happy to see someone.  Now if you want to have an intimate dinner where NO ONE will see you, this is the place!  Cause there is NO one there, and that may be because of the location or it may be because the food is nothing to write home about.\n\nThe food was alright, nothing that made you say, this is someplace I want to savor; as a matter of fact we left most of what we ordered on the plate. Though the service was good, since there were no other customers, it was just us, not much you can do. If you are looking for a nice bottle of wine, this is not the place; they have no selection at all, a house red wine and one other selection or a chardonnay.  \n\nThe bill with tax was over 50 bucks, most of that was of course the wine and a drink.  Got a big kick out of the YELP COUPON on the site when I checked in that promoted a 0% (Yes ZERO Percent off your bill) when you showed them you checked in.  I showed this to our waitress and she said well sometimes it might show up when you refresh, but I will give you a 20% off, which of course she never did.\n\nThere have to be better taco places in Phoenix, I am sure!"
0,"A Vegas-style P.F. Chang's.  Woopty-fricken-do.  \n\nLooks nice from the outside but nothing special on the inside.  When you sit down, all of the chairs are rickety...they rock back and forth when you move.  \n\nFood was average.\nOverpriced.\nService was slow and they didn't seem to care about your requests.\n\nDon't even bother.  The Wynn made a bad choice here."
1,"Elvis is my platonic lover, so I was mesmerized by the live music, dancing, singing, costumes, and acrobats. This was not my first Cirque show, so I agree that it didn't have the nonstop acrobatic routine like other shows. However, the fantastic music and dance made up for it. \n\nFrom the moment I stepped into the theater, I stepped back in time. Raised by an Elvis loving grandmother, I felt like this was my opportunity to live the Elvis Vegas experience. The beginning gave me the chills and made me teary eyed because it was like I was one of the crazy fans cheering, \""Elvis!Elvis! Elvis!\"" right before the curtains opened at a concert and Elvis rocked the stage. If you aren't an Elvis fan or a fan of rock and roll, you probably will not have the same rockin' experience. \n\nFortunately,  my seats were next to two older gentlemen (late 60's). They shared all their fond memories of Elvis and danced the night away. It was such a memorable Elvis and Vegas experience.\n\nThe bar outside the theater has large delicious drinks. I had the tasty and strong \""Viva Elvis.\"""
1,By far best Peruvian food in Arizona. Loved the lomo saltado and the service was exceptional. Will definitely be back to get my peruvian food fix.
1,"Went to the Thai Style Noodle House for lunch today with a couple friends, (one of who is a regular there). He's addicted to the beef noodle soup, so naturally, I had to try it out as well. The first thing I noticed about this little place was the Tshirts pinned to the wall, so cheesy and SO THAI! Of course we were greeted warmly with the never fail big Thai smile from the hostess that I've come to expect from the Thais when I meet them.\nThere were computer printout menu items with pictures scattered around the walls as well, and coupled with the Thai TV programming and Tshirts, I was reminded of a typical Thai noodle shop one can find all over Thailand.....(sigh, I miss you).\nI noticed on one of the printouts a picture of Penang Curry with avocado. One of my buddies wanted that, and when I mentioned to the waitress that he was a vegetarian, she quickly produced a completely separate vegetarian menu. That was cool, although he stuck with the avocado Penang curry with tofu. He ordered it at #9 of 10 in spiciness.\nMy noodle soup arrived and was promptly devoured and washed down with a Thai iced tea. The broth was hearty, the noodles soft, and there was a large chunk of baby bok choy, and plenty of bean sprouts to compliment the meatballs and sliced beef. I thought the soup could've used a touch of cilantro, but it was very good and well balanced. I also tasted some of the avocado Penang which I thought would be too hot for my tastes, but turned out to be just right. The flavor was full, yet balanced and the tofu & avocado with the coconut & curry worked well together. The portions here are large, and overall it was a good value for the money. I look forward to returning to explore the other menu items and hopefully finding another Thai gem for my palate."
0,"Executive Summary - Is this real churrasco?  Is Disney real life?  The truth is a resounding NOOOOOOOO.  This is side show, a theatrical performance, but is is not authentic\n\nI am in Las Vegas on a long term project with an expense account.  I was in need for some comfort food . . . that's right P-I-C-A-N-H-A . . . say it again PICANHA.  Several choices here in Las Vegas and Fogo arriving next month.  I will check out the others and then Fogo when it arrives.  I know picanha . . . Porc\u00e3o no Brasil and others . . . I make picanha at home.  I know picanha, son, and well this is not good picanha.  That is right I said the impossible . . . this is not good picanha.  You might be saying . . . impossible but it is true.  Of the piles of picanha I got, mostly because the rest of the meat was worse, only 4 pieces were cooked to my liking.  Well done is not my style and hey the lamb chop was almost inedible as it was cooked past well done . . . Yep I said it past well done lamb chop.\n\nI speak portuguese, know Brasil and come to churrascaria to relax, speak that amazing language that stirs my soul, get a good caipirinha, eat delicious meat and if I am lucky sip some cacha\u00e7a velha (Aged Cacha\u00e7a).  I was disappointed on all counts.  I only spoke to two Brasileiros, the caipirinha was made by an american bartender that added so much sugar that I might as well just stuck my head in a bag of sugar and the cacha\u00e7a selection sucked, Leblon and 55.  Really Leblon rarely seen in Brasil and 55 is pinga . . . nasty, nasty stuff for alcoholics.  Where is a nice Vale Verde or a Armazem Veiera or Anizio Santiago Habana . . . well no where in sight.  Oh and it is Lingui\u00e7a,  not Sausage . . . When I asked if some could be brought around the waiter did not even know what it was.  \n\nThe salad bar even sucked.  \n\nI will not return . . . ever.  I would rather close my eyes, lift a burger to my lips, and pretend it was picanha . . . it would be closer than the overcooked rendition I had at Texas de Brazil.  \n\nOh and the p\u00e3o de quiejo was served cold and nasty.  Really how can you state you are authentic Brasilian churrasco and screw that up?  I don't know."
1,"Stopped by Sugar Daddy's yesterday and picked up a 4 pack of cupcakes. The deal is now 4 for 12 not 4 for 10 anymore :(   I did the signature, carrot cake, lemon and a red velvet my daughter's favorite. I am not a super sweet type of person and usually scrape frosting off everything and this was no exception. The cupcakes them selves were very moist and tasty. we sampled all 4 and left the 4 remaining halves for her hubby. Very cute shop easy to get in and out for being located in a mall, I just parked outside of forever 21 walked through, it on the right just outside of the front doors."
1,really liked it.
0,"The experience was fairly decent, despite the LONG check-in line and no fridge in the room. The kicker however was the power-tripping security guard who would not let me communicate with my Mom or 88 y.o. Grandmother while I was holding my toddler since we were somewhere near a slot machine. Really, someone else can hold the baby?! Awful logic!"
1,"Great staff, great management, great food. I hear it's a chain but has a local bar feel. Seems very welcoming as a place to h g even on a laptop. They have WiFi. Cool new place. Looking forward to hanging out here a lot."
1,"I knew someone who recommended Arizona Hair Co but I always am skeptical of chains.  This time was different. Both my toddlers were agreeable to a haircut and my last haircut was 4 months ago.  I normally have to squeeze in an appt during my lunch hour.  But yesterday, a Saturday, my kids were done playing at Chuck E Cheese's in Ahwatukee and I noticed the salon still open.  Because every free minute counts, I took a chance and walked in.  $10 only for a kids cut, yeah.  Then after only waiting less than 5 minutes (there were 5-6 stylists this day after 4pm) both my kids were in booster seats.  After looking over the stylists who seemed trendy and experienced, I asked for a cut, too. Nicole was very quick and experienced.  I have never looked so good with straight hair!  She put long layers in and I can't believe I didn't give them a try sooner.  I usually go to Carsten's Aveda School of Cosmetology on Rural in Tempe for its location and scalp massages.  I will definitely go back to the Ahwatukee location of Arizona Hair Co.  My kids' hair turned out very nice, too!"
0,"My friend and I wanted to try a new place and didn't want to travel far from flamingo and 215 area. We enlisted Yelp to help us find a place to dine at. Shucks came to mind. After reading all the reviews this seemed to be THE place the be! so we decided to give it at shot. \n\nWhen you walk in you see is the bar, we looked for a hostess but there's a sign to seat yourself. On the right hand side is the bar with some high top tables to sit at and on the left there are tables and booths restaurant style. We decided to sit at a booth with a large table because we were planning on eating a lot of food. We were greeted by the waiter and he gave us some time to look at the menu. \n\nThere is a pretty good selection of seafood and other items such as sandwiches and pasta to choose from. My friend and I went for the seafood. We ordered 1/2 a dozen raw oysters on the shell, 1/2 lb of black mussels, 1/2 lb of manila clams, 1 lb of snow crab legs, garlic french fries, and a crab and spinach dip. seasonings for the seafood we choose lemon and garlic. \n\nThe food didn't take too long to come out except for our garlic fries. First, came the crab and spinach dip. Consistency was different than what I'm used to. It was a little runny and had a strong sea food taste from the crab. I'm used to this dip being a little thicker and more creamy.  We had to add some hot sauce, salt and pepper to the appetizer so it wouldn't taste as bland. The chips that came with it were almost a cross between a tortilla and a pita bread. \nNext came the oysters. Those were delicious. White meat not cloudy and didn't smell fishy. Then the rest of our food arrived.\n\n Everything smelled so GOOD and mouth watering but when we started slurping and eating everything our noses deceived us. The food smelled so tasty and aromatic but it did not taste the same way. Weird right? I guess we are so used to eating at Hot 'n' Juicy. We finished our meal and I totally didn't even notice that our garlic fries never came out. We flagged down the waiter and asked them if they forgot it? He went to check and said the cooks forgot but it seemed like he forgot to ring it in. \n\nThe fries came out about 5 minutes later super oily and shiny with some sort of garlic white powder on top of them. I didn't even want to eat it. I tried one and the moment I bit into it I felt like an oil bubble bursted into my mouth.\n\nThis place is nice and clean but the service was a little poor. They only had 2 table sitting in that area with 2 servers serving as well.  The price is good for what you get especially since it is seafood. \n\nSo if you are looking for something close in the area with mediocore seafood. This will be the spot."
1,"I have had two fantastic experiences on the Gateway Clipper Fleet.  \n\nThe first was for the Captain's Dinner Dance cruies on Valentine's Day.  When you make your reservation, make a request if you want to be seated in a specific area, especially if you want window seating or to be seated on the main floor.  \n\nI wasn't sure what to expect other than standard banquet fare and some dance music.  The cruise exceeded my expectations.  They were very efficient on getting passengers on board even though they herd you into a line so they can take your picture as you board the ship.  You were able to board about an hour before departure and enjoy a la carte drinks and appetizers.  Skip the appetizers and eat something before you get on or just save room for dinner.  Drinks were on the expensive side but that is to be expected at this type of event.  There were several speciality drinks that come in a souvenier cup.  Your second drink will be cheaper because you won't be paying for the glass again.  \n\nAs the boat pulled away from the docks, we were treated to a brief narration about hilights in Pittsburgh's skyline.  It was informative enough to give you a taste of information but not so intrusive that it was annoying.  Despite a fully packed boat, tables were escorted to the buffet quickly and efficiently and the food supply was constantly replenished.  Despite my thoughts that it would be standard banquet food, everything was actually quite tasty.  When the buffets were removed, the dancing started.  There was a live \""band\"" that had guitar, keyboards and a singer (backed up by tracks of music).  Their quality of playing wasn't the best, but I'm a music snob so I let it slide so I could kick back nad have a good time.  They played a variety of music ranging over the decades but seemed to mostly focus on disco.  I would have preferred there to be more slow cances considering it was Valentine's Day, but we had a great time dancing.  Before we knew it, the boat was pulling back in to Station Square and a fun night came to a close.\n\nThe second time I took the Gateway Clipper was for the shuttle to a Pirates game.  The service was efficient and drops you off right at PNC Park.  My only complaint is that we just missed getting on to one of hte smaller ships so we had to wait until the larger one was at capacity before they shuttled us to PNC which ended up making us late for the start of the game.  If you plan on taking the shuttle, make sure you give yourself enough time."
0,"I really wanted to like it.  The place is cute with lots of colorful lamps and such, but the food was really awful.  The beef in the soup smelled icky, the squash curry had way too much oil, the squash was tough, and the few pieces of wilted broccoli were overcooked.  We didn't even eat half of our food, and then we regretted that we had eaten that much.  Not that we got sick or anything, but it was just pretty yuck. \n\nNever going back."
0,"The food wasn't the problem, had the buffet on a Saturday afternoon, and there was plenty of pizza, breadsticks, salad, etc. But I was unaware that I should have brought my own 2 liter of pop. The waitress, Carolynne was BAD, never came to the table at ALL. But did stop at one of the tables near by many times. Now she maybe a good waitress but if she's has more than 1 table your in trouble!!!"
0,We arrived four minutes early after a taxi ride for our reservation and made an early reservation because we had plans for seeing a show. We were made to feel very unwelcome so we opted not to return. The Bar was full of happy hour patrons and we were given the ultimatum to sit at the bar and buy some small plates or to leave and come back in four minutes. If the restaurant was closed at the time I'd understand but it wasn't and I had a reservation.The host knew we had a reservation and told us to leave. \n\nWe had a lovely meal somewhere else without having a reservation.\n\nWe were looking forward to dining at Fleur but will probably skip it next time too due to it's a big town with many options that are more welcoming.
0,"I have been a long time customer of RZ, even from the Midvale days.  The color and cut as well as other services, mani pedi, massage, facial, waxing, and others, were well done and exactly what I wanted. \nMy stylist left and they RANDOMLY assigned another stylist to me WITHOUT ANY COMMUNICATION!  They texted me to confirm my upcoming appointment with the different person and did not think to use that same number to actually talk to me about this change beforehand.  With about a month to tell me of my stylist's leaving before my appointment, it could have been handled better."
0,If I could give this less than a 1 star I would. From the time we walked in until the time we left it was the worst dining experience I've ever had. \nRather than good morning when we walked in it was sit anywhere. Unfortunately there wasn't a clean table to accommodate our party. \nThen the powdered Chia Tea was way overpriced. I had to send my food back because the eggs were spoiled tasting and the steak had more grizzle and fat than meat. \nSarah our server was either embarassed to work there or just didn't know how do her job. I was even surprised that when I send my horrific meal back she didn't even offer a suggestion or apology.  The  manager didn't even come by the table to see if there was anything that could be done. \nI wouldn't recommend this place even to my ex in-laws.
0,My girlfriend spoke big about this place. Once I got there and ate the entire meal I came to the conclusion that the chicken shack aka chicken bonz is better. She also stated that there was a different cook last time she went and it was better. This time around it was a short hispanic lady that made it. The fries weren't crispy. They were actually soggy and hot. the wings were something that I could have made at home but 10x better. The best thing was the orange crush pop. \n\nOverall I would prefer to make the drive to the sunset  chicken shack because after reading the review for the shack on maryland. I won't be going there either. I would be willin to try this place again if its a differnt cook.
0,"I don't know what happened to this place.  Loved it a few months ago.  I visited this week during CES on a Monday and paid $35 to get in.\n\nIt was not the same experience at all.  All the food was dried up and I just didn't feel satisfied at all.  There were a lot of Japanese businessmen sitting next to me and they were all ranting in Japanese how bad it was throughout my meal too.  They even talked about going to another restaurant afterwards.\n\nTo top it off, all the dried up crab I was eating gave me food poisoning which gave me a bad stomach ache / diarrhea / vomit for a week now.  It ruined my Las Vegas vacation and the days after.\n\nI will never be returning to Wicket Spoon.  It's not worth the chance to ruin my vacation in that way again.\n\n---\nUpdate : As an added bonus, I emailed their management about this and got no response."
1,"Stopped by last Saturday night for some soup, as I had a bit of a cold and wanted some chicken noodle soup... but who says it has to be BORING chicken noodle soup?   Woohoo for Pho!\n\nI got the chicken Pho and hubby got the combo Pho - and we were both amazed at how incredibly good it was.  I started feeling better from the first bite/slurp!\n\nI haven't tried ALL the Pho shops in town, so consider that when I say.. this was, by far, the best Pho ever!\n\nService was attentive, the take-out for the leftovers was nicely packaged, and very affordable & excellent food.\n\nWill I return?  Totally, and soon!"
1,"Why you should go to Trunkspace:  It's a cool artspace that features good local artists and cool local bands.  Touring bands come here often as well.  Because Trunkspace is an independent space you can see some of the weirdest, quirkiest, oddest (read:  uncommercial) music out there.  JRC and Steph are good proprieters and friendly to artists and people attending events.  They stock homemade items and also serve up some good coffee.  Big Plus:  The Photobooth!  \n\nThe downside:  no alcohol is served here.  However, just step over next door to The Bikini lounge for all the cheap swill you heart desires."
0,"This club is overrated. If you want to pay top dollar for a VIP table and pretend you're a boss, this is the place for you. Tiny dance floor and most of the main floor is filled up with VIP tables. \n\nWe went here on a Saturday night and got in gratis since we had a great hookup. You ride in an elevator up to the club. Inside the main room is amazing with cool elements that rise and fall from the ceiling, and a huge LED Screen behind the DJ. Being inside this club is confusing because there are hallways that lead to nowhere, stairs all over the place and dark corridors. For whatever reason the people dancing all faced DJ Lema instead of each other, we've never experienced that in any other club. \n\nWe took a look outside and the poolside bartender didn't know how to make a Wet Panty and acted like I was the crazy one. What's with the attitude?  Dude, you're all of 22, get over yourself!\n\nWe love going to clubs wherever we travel and we've been to other LV clubs when they first opened up, like Pure and Tryst. We've also been to Pure's sister club, Aura.  in the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas and danced til 5am. Marquee just didn't do it for us. The main room was playing EDM which we love, but the music just wasn't inspiring. We checked out the library, which is pretty much the only place to sit down if you don't have a VIP table. The best room was the Hip Hop room, which was totally packed and the music was great. If we had started out in here we probably would have stayed and dropped some cash on drinks, but after the lackluster experience in the main room we were done.\n\nTo exit the club we had to walk down 4 flights of stairs. Good luck to the girls wearing high heels, thankfully I was wearing flats and made it downstairs without incident."
1,"Laid-back, and more affordable food than some of the other Mirage establishments. Had The Stripper burger (bunless) but if you are expecting a protein burger (in the likes of In n'Out or Five Guys, you are not getting that! You are getting a burger you eat with a fork and knife. I forgot to order the cheese and the burger was okay. I should have ordered some cheese, probably would have been better. \n\nWhen I am in Vegas again, probably give this place another chance, selection looks decent, and the price is just right."
0,"I'm not too sure what to think of this place. After reading the two previous reviews on Yelp, I thought this would be a good place to go get my hair cut. So I made an appointment and went one rainy afternoon. The girl who cut was hair was friendly and meticulous, but quite honestly she didn't do a very good job. First, she hardly cut anything at all, which I find very annoying: if I'm going to pay $40 on a haircut, I don't want to have to come back in two weeks. Second, I'm not too hot about the way she cut it... nothing terrible, but again not worth $40. Don't take me wrong, I have no problem spending $40 on a haircut (and in fact I used to spend $50 all the time in NYC), but it has to be a good haircut. Of course, I haven't tried every single stylist there, and maybe they do a better job on women. But hairdressers are one type of business that I don't give second chances to, so I don't think I'll be going back."
1,"Awesome place, very hip."
1,"I went in the store walking into a chaotic warfare! It was the day when Ashleys was handing out up to $2,000 credit limits. Although many customers complained about waiting for over 5 hours, I simply waited for 2. I was greeted in a very friendly manner and assisted very thoroughly for my first time purchasing furniture this way. Each of the employees and even the manager that assisted me were extremely friendly. No complaints and I will visit them again for future purchases."
0,Went back to Korean Garden Saturday night with some family in town from out of the country and was so disappointed.  My favorite salad was gone and replaced with what appeared to be bagged iceberg lettuce with tasteless dressing.  The meat was bland.  Plus the service was not up to par.  I doubt we will be going back here and we have been long time customers.
1,"It's not the most masculine place to go for Happy Hour & drinks, but it works. Their HH drinks are pretty good, especially the Satisfaction Giaranteed & the \""Intoxicaked\"". Mojitos were good too. \n\nFor HH food, found the chicken sliders VERY GOOD. Have eaten their croquets - they were fairly good. Next time I'll save room for their burger & cheesesteak sliders...\n\nWent at 9pm on a Tuesday and had the bar to ourselves."
1,"I love what this place is striving towards. Things I specifically love:\n\n 1) a stable, dependable, local outdoor farmer's market on Saturday and Wednesday - full of awesome local goods and repping the people who actually grow/make the stuff\n 2) a permanent building housing a stock of a selection of said goods, open most days of the week\n 3) although i'm already a locavore, discovering new sources for real food, like DoubleCheck Ranch's beef etc - i'm a huge fan!\n 4) the cool design and layout of the structure\n 5) a genuinely friendly atmosphere and helpful, if still learning, staff\n 6) the constantly fresh-roasted beans at the Royal Coffee Bar - hayes is the (somewhat effeminate) man!\n 7) a place to keep discovering new quirky local arts and foodstuffs\n\n\nI hope to give this 5 stars in the future. Here's what needs to happen:\n\n 1) be open on Sunday\n 2) expand your offerings and keep the shelves filled (i know this is a challenge)\n 3) have more ppl available to help ring up during busy times (market saturday, etc)\n 4) inspire more confidence that if i order a sammich, i'll get it before dinner (i haven't ordered one yet, but i'm scared to because i don't know who's gonna make it - i don't see anyone cooking stuff!)\n\nUltimately, this is EXACTLY the kind of stuff phoenix needs in its efforts to  be the \""real city\"" that everyone bitches it ain't. So if you want it to succeed and want more of this in phoenix's future, support it. Give constructive feedback. Buy real local food instead of the crap at most supermarkets. \n\nYou have 3 choices: support, bitch or get stoned and order domino's"
1,"Boy, did I enjoy those fried pickles and chicken wings. These really did hit the spot when I decided to spurge for my birthday this year! \n\nI know now where I want to come when I want some wings or pickles, or any other tasty bar food. I would be safe to say that the wings I had at Armadillo Grill were some of the best in Phoenix (and I've had a lot of wings throughout the valley). But make sure to order the wings with Armadillo Gold Sauce, they were made to perfection.  \n\nBe sure to to have a nice beer and enjoy some games on one of the many screens.  There is also a patio for the warmer weather :)"
0,"I wanted to love this place since it's one of the only Mexican restaurants within walking distance of Fremont.  But the food was just run of the mill.  Nothing amazing.  \n\nTamales were 3 stars.  Everything else I've tried on the menu (enchiladas, tacos and burrito) drags the place down to two stars.  If it weren't in the run down part of downtown, I'm not sure Dona Maria's would still be around."
0,"People who rate this place over 2 stars are either \""on the books\"" or suffered from a frontal lobotomy. \n\nHere are 6.5 reasons not to go here:\n\n1) El Zocalo had a 2.5hr wait last night, so we walked across the street to Serranos and was immediately seated\n\n2) Ordered Don Julio Margaritas, received 4 small wine glasses with Sweet & Sour (waitress acknowledged they were made with too little alcohol)\n\n3) Terrible Ambiance (drop tile-ceiling, commercial pressboard restaurant tables)\n\n4) Waitress couldn't remember what anyone ordered numerous times (forgot sour cream, forgot corn tortillas)\n\n5) Rather than coming by to fill up the water, they leave pitchers on the table\n\n6) the food was doused in salt; heck, even this morning I had to move my watch band out a notch\n\n6.5) There's an adult video store next door..."
1,"GREAT food!! EXCELLENT & FRIENDLY service!! and SPEEDY deliveries!!\n\nthis place is a true gem!! & FYI.. I've never taken the time to write a yelp review before, but after having the pleasure of dealing w/ Nick and his staff at Mr. Mama's i felt the need to write this. (that says a lot!!)"
0,"What a load of crap... first off, the salespeople completely ignored us in light of the tony stewart promo people giving away free shi* out front. They were all in line to stuff their fat faces at the hotdog grill spewing gaging black smoke all over the front of the dealershit(and choking us at the same time) When I finally just shoved my way through the line of \""starving\"" salespeople to get inside, to my amazement(insert sarcasm here) THERE WAS NO ONE INSIDE TO HELP US!!!(SHOCKER) So after finally getting flipped through 3 different people and an hour worth of paperwork, we were told that I don't make enough to qualify for ANY OF THE PIECE OF SHIT USED JUNK THEY HAD ON THEIR SHADY A$$ LOT... and I make 10 bucks an hour and work a 50 hour work week, and I have basically shi* for bills and mediocre credit... what a joke. If I can't get financed through this shi*hole, but Findlay and Chapman are drooling to get my business A.S.A.P(they just didn't have type of car I need at the moment) SOMETHING IS SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH THIS BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nIF I WERE YOU, I WOULD JUST PASS ON THIS SCHEME... IT'S WORSE THAN DRIVETIME AND CARMAX COMBINED!!!!!!! F**K THAT!!!!"
0,"BEWARE, THERE IS NO DISCOUNT AS THE NAME IMPLIES. It cost me more to take this trip than I've paid in any other cab company. And, the cab smell like smoke. The driver was not smoking in the car at the time, but someone had been in the car smoking because the smell was very intense. And, there's a \""Thanks for not smoking\"" sticker on the window. I had a headache by the time I arrived to my destination."
1,"This store is so on point!friendly staff,ambiance is chill and relaxed and there's never any pressure to buy anything.Just came out with a new build and purchased some juice.Even if it's a bit of a drive from where I live this place is my 'go to' vape store/lounge.never disappoints"
0,The buns fall apart so you end up eating your burger with a soggy bun.  Staff does not seem to know what is going on and they are not well trained.  Can't think on their own.
1,this place is great!\nAwesome Menu Selections\nGreat food Great Value\nGreat Service\nGreat Bar\nGreat Wine Selection\nA go to spot if you live or come to Las Vegas
1,"We had a party of six who went for a birthday celebration.  Awesome drinks, awesome service, awesome food!  The prime rib was as good as the reviews said it was, the blue burger (made with prime rib) was so juicy the bread did get a little soggy but oh so delicious, the prime rib sandwich was amazing and the au jus was delicious.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant."
0,"WOW!  Crap-O!  We have gone to other TGI Fridays in the past and had a much better experience.  Stopped in here on our way back from a weekend trip.  Tried to go to a neighboring restaurant, but did not want to wait 45 minutes.  Low and behold we were able to get right in at TGIF!  I guess that should have been our first red flag!!  We were seated right away and our server took drink orders and apps order.  We ordered the Green Bean Fries - these were pretty good, but not as good as the ones at PF Changs.  I ordered the Dragon Fire Salmon, which comes with rice pilaf and broccoli.  My wife ordered the TGIF Shrimp, which comes with fries and all you can eat shrimp.  When our meals arrived, my plate looked like a garbage pile!  You know, like when you watch a cooking show and they keep throwing the scraps onto a pile somewhere on the side...Well, that was my plate!  A messy pile up of rice, broccoli, and salmon!  What a mess.  I had to deconstruct the pile of garbage before I could begin eating.  When the waitress asked how it was, and I told her the truth, she seemed to not really care at all.  Then the manager was making the butt-kissing rounds and asked how things were.  I repeated my minor complaint to her, and she just sort of shrugged and said \""thanks\"" while she walked away.  Messy presentation aside, the salmon was pretty good.  The rest was ok.  My wife's meal was nothing special and she practically had to beg for the refill of shrimp.  Worst part, though, was the waitress.  Her name was Stephanie.  VERY inattentive to customers.  Took eons for her to notice we needed drink refills. Took forever to get the bill, as well.  Next booth over was luckier - they had a server named Jessica and she was super attentive and made me feel jealous that I was not seated in her section!  Overall we will NEVER eat here again!  No way, no how!"
0,"A group of us went there a couple of weeks ago.  It was a little disappointing.  First of all it takes about 4 minutes to go through the whole attraction.  The actors found it as cheesy as I did because they had a hard time staying in character.  For $ 40 per person there should have at least been a drink included.  And as far as the cocktails, watch out!  Gratuity is included but the bartenders are hesitant to tell you this.  For 3 of us the tab was $45 per round, with tip included, normal for Vegas but a little shady.  The only reason I'm giving a second star is because the view from the lounge is good.  Would I go back?  No."
0,"Going to Robbie Fox's was probably my worst restaurant experience ever!!! And I spent five years in the industry.\n\nThe reviews and the menu indicated that this place had more of a restaurant than a pub style atmosphere . So I decided to stop in with my wife and baby for LUNCH in the middle of a Saturday afternoon. Well, by the time we left, my wife was nearly in tears because she feared that the employee who greeted us might hit me. They had a bouncer, not  a hostess, outside the door to greet us, or rather rebuke us for trying to enter with our baby in the middle of the afternoon. The bouncer was very rude and treated my family like some drunken ASU students. He was very unprofessional, perhaps a result of performing his job duties in 110 F weather. When I asked for an explanation he immediately accused me of trying to argue with him rather than letting me know that there was a large crowd of rowdy soccer fans inside but that it should calm down in about a half hour when the game ends, which I did not become aware of until later that day. When I questioned his attitude and asked to speak with a manager he got angered and raised his voice. I raised mine a bit in return. My wife asked that we leave, quivering.\n\nI emailed the GM, Mike Aiton, about the situation. It is almost two weeks later and no response. His help definitely needs to be told to drop the tough guy attitude. This sort of behavior is completely unacceptable. \n\nI have never experienced bouncers with this sort of attitude at any Mill Ave bars much less a Mill Ave restaurant. \n\nTry Rula Bula (down the street), Casey Moore's (on Ash I think) or Darcy McGee's at Tempe Marketplace if you want an Irish public house."
0,"I stopped by here yesterday for a slice of pizza.  On the way to my lunch I noticed a sign in their window that they had slices for $1.99 and since I am always on a quest to find the best pizza in Pittsburgh, I figured I would stop by afterwards.  The inside of this place isn't much too look at as there is a small area with a counter in front of it and then the kitchen.  Whenever we got into the restaurant I asked for a slice of pizza.  Less than 2 minutes later I was walking out with the slice inside of a box.  Upon making it to my car I took the time to examine the pizza.  The first thing that I noticed was the glassy looking cheese on it which didn't bode too well.  Then immediately after that I realized how small it was.  I could probably get a slice 3-4 times as large for a buck in Manhattan.  Overall the taste of this somewhat cold pizza matched the look of it.  The cheese and sauce weren't that great and the crust was super dry.  I probably would have done better buying a frozen pizza and making that instead.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I wouldn't head back here again in the future.  It's tough to feel ripped off by a $2 slice of pizza but Vinny's somehow did that for me with both the size and taste."
0,"Found this place on groupon. 25$ for 50$ worth of drinks, I mean who would say no to that! Plus I have this thing for tapas style foods so I was very excited to try this place out.\n\nCame here on a Friday night with my friend, it was extremely dead. First thing I smelt was smoke but hey, it's a bar what did I expect? Immediately greeted by Eric, our bartender for the night. He was very nice & attentive. He did mention he just started working so he was kind of clueless with the cocktail menus as well as the foods but I won't hold that against him!\n\nFor the foods--  this place is at the bottom of my list of tapas foods. We ordered..\nMango chicken -- nothing special about it looked like grilled chicken in mango salsa. \nStuffed dates -- The dates were so big! & was wrapped in a small size bacon that didn't match the portion size of the dates.\nCrab cake -- this was pretty delicious but the presentation of the dish wasn't appealing. When it came out it looked like a burger patty swimming in sauce. \nBuffalo wings-- nothing to say there it's wings lol \nCeviche -- it was pretty good. The chips looked like it came outta a bag that you buy at the super market.\nMeatball sliders -- meatballs were midget size compared to the bun. Tasted bland.\n\nCocktails & wine-- got the job done. They weren't terrible. \n\nOverall, I probably will not be returning. Me and friend did have fun there but we have fun anywhere really. Lol"
0,"Food is decent; Tuesdays are buy one hot dog get one half off, but the service tanked their review. The teeny bopper employees are clueless. The girl who rang us up didn't bother to give us a number and left me and my husband at the register while she went to help another customer with their food. When we asked, she said she would remember our order - only it was another girl bringing the food.  When I went to get ketchup a huge splash of gross yellow green tinged water splashed on my foot. I told an employee immediately and not only did she not get napkins so I could clean off the gross, she didn't even bother to mop up the puddle of water!"
1,"Came here on a fluke and boy was it one on the best one's yet.\n\nHands down the best menudo in town. No hominy (the way i prefer it). It is soooo well seasoned and not at all overly greasy. It doesn't stink or taste dirty, if you eat menudo you know what I mean. It's $5 for a large portion of this stuff. A great deal if you ask me. \n\nFish tacos - okay. not to die for. not the best.\n\nCarne asado - decent. good. \n\n\n\nBut i come here for the Menudo. Plain and simple."
0,"Over priced for Medicor food,   service is really slow,   took 45 mins to get food on a Monday at 11, {and after asking 3 times}  the only thing was good were the names of the food.   Made me lauph for a bit,  but sadly,  that's it.  There's nothing really unique or special about  this place,   service was sub par,  waitreses were air headed,  food was OK,  but not worth the price.  Rather go to Dennys or waffle house and pay alot less for same taste.  Aaaand be able to get it in a timely manner."
0,"They must have changed their menu from 3 years ago...but changed for the worse...\n\nWe ordered:\nKobe Burger-This was good.  But I can't taste the difference between this one and the regular quarter pounder, but of course it costs more.\n\nElk Burger-could definitely taste the difference in this burger, BUT, not in a good way.  Kinda gamey...took one bite and place it back on the tray.  \n\nWedge fries-they were just soft and soggy.  I remembered it being nice and crisp on the outside, and light and tender in the middle...not like this.\n\nOreos Cookie Shake-there were big chunks of oreos in my shake, and the shake isn't thick and creamy like how I remembered it either.\n\nI don't know...could it be that I just had sliders from Slidin' Thru days prior?  Could it be that I didn't care for burgers that day?  Maybe because my memories of Fuddruckers was that it is a freakin' awesome burger joint and had high hopes and it just didn't meet my expectation?  Well, whatever the cause was, the effect is that I won't be coming back."

There are better places in town with better food, service and prices."
0,I was calling to inquire about delivery to a certain area that was not represented on the site. The woman who answered the phone acted like I was inconviencing her with my silly questions.  I was also told that they don't deliver to certain areas during holiday weeks.  Isn't that the whole point of ordering one of the arrangements?  I won't be calling back and ordering from this store ever.
0,"Went here on 1/2/12 to find out they were taking a 3-day weekend, so i came back today. THE PLACE WAS PACKED full of people wanting to return/exchange receivers as i was because i got fed up with not having the service being functional.\nthe only good things that actually came out of this 45 minute wait was getting a brand-new cisco receiver, which still didnt fix anything. called em up, and they refreshed the signal which helped for about 5 minutes before screwing up some more. now i have a scheduled technician visit tomorrow....it'll probably  either a crotchidy old man, or a younger man telling me to quit complaining because there are less fortunate people who dont have cable even though i'm paying dearly for my services. once again, i am VERY disappointed with cox communications. Wish me luck on the appointment!\n\n--UPDATE--\n\nthe Cox Tech (a stocky redheaded guy) finally got here an hour late, and comes in with a hell of an attitude, acting like he knew everything and the problem was my fault, blaming the receiver not cox as well as being told on the phone that he would bring cords and a ladder, upon getting here he said if it needed a new cord that i would have to schedule another time because he was on a schedule that didnt include that. after all this bullcrap and proving the box was not entirely the problem, he changed the head of one of the cords connected to my HD DVR it fixed the problem slightly. so he went and changed the receiver and blamed the receiver for being glitchy, new and giving off too much noise in the signal he finally got it working good enough he ran on out to his truck, started to leave and i realised he left one of the other tv's and the modem still unplugged. so i called him back in and upon repairing he growls and says \"" god, im soo stupid, i left the other things unplugged.   i bet by now you think we probably just come in and fix one thing by breaking another, well thats not how we work.\""..... pfffftt could've fooled me, upon fixing this issue he runs back out to his truck and takes off, and after getting a complaint from the watchers of two of the other tv's i call him back again and he came back in and fixed them.\n\nalso forgot to add, the third time he came in he blundered through my house knocking things down, including a once-expensive camcorder. but being the nice person i am, im going to overlook it.\n\nhe also said the new cisco Explorer 8642HDC (that cox is giving EVERYBODY) he said there is a well-known widescale issue with the recording and playback, and that there should be a fix within a week. sounds great, cox giving out a box that THEY KNOW is broken.\nonce again, i am very displeased with their service, customer service, and technicians. and i would most certainly not recommend cox to anyone."
1,One of our favorite Mexican places in town!
0,Probably an ok place to grab a drink and watch some sports but wouldn't recommend you eat there. I ordered the chicken/brie sandwich - sounded lovely on the menu but it was boiled chicken - so rubbery it was tough to cut through. My husband ordered the steak tacos. They were so greasy he couldn't pick them up. We both had bad stomach ache for hours after eating there.
1,"We were completely thrilled to have lunch here.  Friends of ours took us out to eat and we ate very well.  \n\nBefore we went, our friends told us this is the type of place where they make one menu each day and you have a very limited number of choices.  But, it is also a market so you can get just about anything.  (a bit confusing of our friends)\n\nFood wise, the food was amazing.  We ate everything from some amazing panchetta to a fantastic lamb dish stuffed in the flowers of summer squash.  We also got to enjoy some fresh pasta - a fettuccine dish with mushrooms and sausage.  The bread was really good.  We also enjoyed some great pizza and Focaccia.  For dessert we enjoyed a type of lemon ice (no idea what it was called).\n\nThe staff was really good.  We were warmly greeted by our wait staff.  We got to meet one of the owners.  The kitchen is part of the restaurant (you can see them cook everything).  Every time we had a question about the food, the cooks were happy to answer our questions and give us little snips of the food they were working on.  \n\nThe ambiance was also really wonderful.  It is a small place setup like a market with a few tables in the middle.  The tables are setup to be communal spaces.  While we filled one table completely, I saw several other groups of people sit at a table and then slowly talk with one another and have interesting looking conversations.  If you are looking for a private table for two, this is not the place for you!\n\nWe have no idea what the total price was for our meal as we were treated.  The entrees were in the $25-30 range on the menu.  The staff was happy to accommodate the dietary restrictions of our group & even double check with the kitchen staff/cooks if there were particular ingredients in various food items.\n\nI would love to return here sometime for dinner."
1,"Surprisingly enough, Charlotte really does not have a shortage of open space uptown.  What may come as a surprise to most people not from Charlotte is that what we in the QC dub as a park is what other people might call a big slab of concrete.\n\nMarshall Park?  Decent amount of greenery, some trees, and even a semi-polluted lake, but covered with parking lots and surrounded by busy streets. One of the coolest parks is Thomas Polk park uptown - but it just has planters sprouting out of the sidewalk and some waterfalls amongst the trees.   Until recently, even the latest \""jewel\"" in the city, Sugar Creek, was entirely covered - for decades no less!\n\nSo it probably does not surprise you that this plaza, while water and a few trees can be found, is mostly: Concrete.  That is just the way it is here, visitors.  Get used to it.  Want green?  You can go to The Green, but most of what you will find uptown is gray.  Still, this is a decent space.  I have not seen any of their movies on the wall for probably a decade or more, but it is a nice gathering spot, even if it does suck in heat like you would not believe."
0,"Am I being biased on my 2 star rating JUST because I got a soda, water and seafood salad? Nah, I don't think so. Service went down the drain. Seriously.\n\nIt was my friend's birthday. The tables were separated into two. One with AYCE sushi and other...the non fatty people. I was on the non-fatty side. The was only ONE server. Yup, just one.\n\nWaited for my lemonade and that took a long while. For the food, the seafood salad is aiggghhtt. Nothing special about it.\n\nMaybe I should try the AYCE here and my perception will change?"
1,"To me this is the ideal for getting your dance on.  A free lounge with a live band that covers all the current top 40/hip hop dance tunes, you know the ones you hear on your car radio that make you want to boogie?  My only complaint is it seems like they group artist's songs together.  They did 3 or 4  of Fergie's songs close together, same with JT.  Minor nit pick.  I would definitely return."
0,"It always seems like I visit Ulta when I'm looking my worst.  I am not sure why this is.  Maybe it's because I look in the mirror and realize that I am in dire need of overpriced cosmetics to salvage my face for the day.  Whatever the reason, I always keep ending up here.  That being said, I don't know why I really keep coming back, especially since the nearby JCPenney has a Sephora now (which is infinitely better).  \n\nThe last time I visited, the Lancome salesperson scared me a little bit.  Lancome makes my favorite formula of lipstick, and I decided I wanted a new shade.  I asked for the salesperson's advice, and she pulls out this light, frosty pink shade.  I was dubious, but I tried it anyway... I was one acid-wash jacket away from having a total 80's throwback moment.  Worst of all, she tried to tell me that it made me look \""radiant.\""  Wow.  I really wonder how these people receive their training.  On more than one occasion, I've been \""pimped\"" something that very obviously doesn't work for me.  One sales associate tried to sell me the wrong shade of foundation... when you demo a foundation and your client has the skin tone of an overripe banana, you've done something wrong.  \n\nAlso, the sales associates are few and far between and have, on multiple occasions, refused to leave whatever stocking job they are working on to help me.  I have also had to wait in line for waaaaaay too long several times because one poor salesperson was stuck ringing people up while the others stood around shooting the breeze.\n\nSephora... Sephora's where it's at.  Not Ulta.  Ick."
1,"Our new favorite place to enjoy breakfast in the Valley!  I absolutely love that the patio is pet friendly and they actually have a tail waggers menu for our furry friend...and she loved it (eggs, turkey and cheese).  The OJ is fresh squeezed and to die for.  I tried the ab cruncher (egg white omelette with chicken, tomatoes and spinach)...seriously healthy and good!  You may have to wait, but trust me it is worth it!"
1,Awesome food. Kinda pricy but worth every penny. Classy as shit. Try the crab cheese whatever. Itll make you change your orientation.
0,The food was average but consistent. Have eaten here a few times due to limited sit down options at the airport. The service is very slow. I don't think it is the servers fault but the management. They are under staffed which creates the issue.
0,I came here for the better selections of glasses. Once I found a pair  we sat down with a lady that was helping us. She was very friendly up until the point that I didn't want to add any additional upgrades.I explained i usually wear contacts but thought it might be nice to have a set of glasses just in case. Her mood changed quickly after i declined the upgrades like i was no longer important it became very awkward.
0,I really wanted to like Lulu  but it was okay. I got the pork belly which was a bit tooo jelly instead of meat. hubby got the fettucini (hes not too adventurous so wanted to play it safe) It was dry with very little flavor. What bothered me was the service. There were only 3 tables of customers the night we went. Our waitress would disappear after giving us our food and we didnt see her for 35-40 mins! So to be on the safe side we asked for the check immediately so as to not have her disappear again. All in all an ok experience.
0,"I don't understand why only \""certain\"" associates can order parts for defective products covered by their year-long warranty. \n\nAnd I most certainly don't understand why you have to make an appointment a day later or further in advance to speak with these \""certain\"" associates when it is 15 minutes to closing and there are only you, five other customers (three of which are browsing the products), and 29 employees. \n\nThese \""certain\"" employees are apparently called their Geniuses. Doesn't take a genius to know that this system is ridiculous. \n\nI JUST WANT YOU TO REPLACE MY BROKEN CHARGING DOCK, GENIUS! Jesus."
0,"Service: Seated promptly in the booth section but was left along with several other patrons at different booths to find our own service after waiting over 4 minutes. Once we got the attention of a server, we placed our order for the lunch special rolls. Even though this place was very busy (~12:30pm with lots of business lunch patrons), you could watch as some servers stood around not doing anything. Rolls came out at a reasonable pace but we weren't even given a small plate to eat each piece off of and had to eat over our roll plates. We were only checked on once (not by our original server) and that was because she was resting her elbow on the booth section divider and casually asked us if everything was good. When we were done eating we waited for at least 5 minutes to see if they would bring a check, then we started making eye contact with servers hoping they would get the point but they would continue with whatever they were doing. We had to flag someone down to get our check. Unacceptable level of service from start to finish.\n\nFood: You could tell how they could offer such good deals on their lunch special rolls when they overload the rolls with rice and fake crab/mayo (I have no problem with either ingredient, but they pack the rolls with it to the point where many different rolls tasted very similar because they were so dominant with the fake crab mix). Each piece was extremely large and cumbersome to eat, often falling apart before you can find a way to fit it in your mouth. The rolls weren't even in the shape of a circle, but more like a rounded triangle. The sushi chefs were either rushed, new, or incompetent. I'm also suspicious that the spicy tuna uses canned tuna as filler along with chunks of real tuna. I'll let you decide if that's acceptable for sushi.\n\nAmbiance: It's ok. You won't pay attention to it when you're trying to get a servers attention."
1,"Beautiful resort away from the crazy strip.\n The pool is really nice, cool poolside bar with built in ice strip to keep your drink cold. I've been to the pool for a few events, and it never feels crowded, there's lots of room, never had a bad time.\n I've eaten the buffet here and its pretty tasty, nice variety, free wine (NICE!). Hash House A Go Go is okay, big portions is their thing, its a chain so the food is average. Babycakes has gelato and pastries and specialty coffees, don't miss the gelato (good stuff).\nI haven't really gambled here, but I'm sure I will one of these days. I know their free gifts when you have a players card are much better than some of the junk other resorts give away.\nI also have never seen their rooms, so I can't comment on them."
0,"Food is great!! Service isn't even decent (much less good), but the food makes up for it. Go during Happy Hour on a week day to get the best prices."
0,"Spice Island is popular among our hospital crew to order from for lunch in Oakland (via Wheel Deliver).  I have never actually been in the restaurant, so my review will be based strictly on the food.  \n\nI have had the pad thai and java fried rice from Spice Island, and both are just OK and forgettable.  The biggest complaint I have with each dish I've had is that the quality of meat and seafood is not very good.  The shrimp in my pad thai was strange tasting and tough and the meat I've had in other dishes was fatty.  Another pet peeve of mine is the amount of grease and oil in the dishes.  I expect a certain amount of oil, but this literally leaves puddles of the stuff at the bottom.  Finally, each dish I've had is disappointingly flavorless. \n\nThe portions are HUGE, but I'd rather pay for less food with more flavor.  \n\nI have heard great things from friends about Spice Island, so I'd like to actually go to the restaurant to eat some time...but I think I'll be passing for lunch for now on."
0,WellsFargo is ok but this location is the worst.  So many rules as a business customer is ridiculous.  Looking into changing banks. Funny how I have issues with the same guy everytime.
1,"I've been thinking of getting my nose pierced for a long time now and my friend recommended me Halo since she had hers pierced a month back. This place is just so amazing! I'm really particular when it comes to piercings but Jeremiah was really accommodating, he answered all my questions - I had a lot! Plus, their selection is so unique, and I really loved the designs! Good thing I had some assistance or else I won't know where to start."
1,"Great place to come for post-clubbing / hangover pho!\n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of soupy noodle dishes (i.e. pho, udon, ramen, etc...I know bad Asian!) so I got the vermicelli bowl with grilled pork chop and egg rolls.  The marinated grilled pork chop was delicious.\n\nI came here on a Saturday afternoon around 1p and didn't have to wait for a table.\n\nThe interior of PKL was once of the cleanest/nicest I've seen for a Vietnamese restaurant."
0,"Um, yeah, no!  Not!  I love coffee houses, but if one is going to go with corporate coffee I would rather hit my local Starbucks that The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.  \""Simply the best?\""  That is their motto, but I think not!  The artificial power they use in their drinks tastes nasty, and never fully disolves in either the hot drinks or the iced drinks.  There is always a nasty, sludgy mess in the bottom.  Plus the powder sticks in my throat and makes me cough.  And none of the employees know anything about the drinks.  They seen very disinterested.  If I am going to buy coffee I want it to be from a fun place.  If I want coffee with morning attitude I can make it at home, and experience by own bad attitude. This Coffee Bean has been a bad experience every time.  Hit the independent coffee houses, or hit the Coffee Beans older, and successful brother, Starbucks.  Why settle for second rate coffee?"
1,"Without a doubt Alphabet is the coolest video shop I have ever been in. Somehow this tiny shop has managed to squeeze in two floors of DVDs and videos scaling from floor to ceiling. Depending on what takes your fancy you could rent something from the world cinema, 1950s, crime, cartoon or Hollywood Blockbuster sections. If they don't have what you're looking for on DVD then they're only too happy to lend you a video player with scart leads etc at no extra charge. The owner of the shop (I call him Tall Face McLovely in my head) beams with pride about Alphabet and he is incredibly willing to spend the time with every customer recommending films he thinks they might enjoy. A great local shop."
0,"First of all,  my wife and I love the Golden Nugget.  Fremont is way better than the strip.  But if your gonna eat sushi, don't eat it at Red.  Yes, of course it is way over priced, but, this is Vegas; so get over it.  The problem is, the rice in the rolls tastes like dirty dish water and all of the ingredients blend together with no distinct taste whatsoever.  We had two rolls at about 12 to 16 dollars apiece, which is a little pricey, but the kicker is that each roll only had 5 to 6 pieces; not the normal 7 to 8 pieces that we have experienced all over the country.  So, you are getting 2/3 the food for about twice the price.  Wouldn't be too bad in Vegas if it didn't taste like butt."
1,"Once you come here you will never go to another Thai restaurant again.  Put simply,  food and value cannot be beat!"
0,"Hertz on Baum Blvd is really awful. Do not rent a car from them. I rented cars for them at least 7-8 times because I had to travel to interviews and did not have a car at the time. I had no other choice because they are walking distance from where I live. Here are my complaints:\n\n1.) The last time I rented a car, the gas tank was only HALF full. Can you believe that? They supposedly did a full \""check\"" before giving me the car, but they somehow did not check to see how full the tank was. Of course I had to fill the tank prior to returning the car so that they would not charge me boat loads of money. Irresponsible.\n\n2.) One lady who works at the front desk is rude. She kept pressuring me to purchase expensive car insurance. When I told her no thank you, she KEPT pressuring me over and over again. That is just bad customer service. A customer has a right to their decision, and if they say no once, you have no business to push them. She really needs to learn how to talk to customers politely. Reading the other reviews on this website, my points here are reinforced. \n\nIn spite of this really cold weather right now, I will be using Enterprise to plan my next trip this weekend, even though I will have to walk and take the bus in this freezing weather."
1,"I've only had the pork ribs, potato salad (they use red potatoes, YES) bread, and their cheesy potatoes, but they are truly delish! I even had some left over that I ate the next day, and I never eat leftovers, ever. Not to mention the amazing smell that hits you like a ton of bricks as soon as you walk anywhere within a mile of this place. My good friend tattoos at a shop next to this place and he took me here on his lunch break. I was reluctant to go because I've never had good bbq that wasn't made on a grill in a backyard, but boy was I wrong. This place does it right with a price that won't make you feel guilty about eating out. And they sell old school candy like bazooka gum and wax lips! SCORE!"
0,There was mold on my daughters pizza. I called and told them and there only response was to tell me to call back tomorrow because there was no manager on duty... I left my contact info and was never called.
1,"I'm not a Vietnamese food expert and so I'm not reviewing Slanted Rice with any kind of mindset that this is authentic Vietnamese food.  However If the food is good than who really cares?\n\nTwo words: shaken beef.  It really is amongst the most delicious dishes I've had in recent memory.  Filet beef, onions, and a great sauce (that next time I will order extra for).  The wings with garlic were also a major hit as were the garlic noodles.  We ended up ordering a second side of it mid meal.  Was not a fan of the pho or the crispy rice dish, but now I know what to get because the rest was phenomenal.  Staff was great, food was great, and I will be back ASAP as well as recommend to others."
1,I'm surprise about the rating about Tea Planet....it should be more stars....cos to me...is really good...they have a good selection of drinks...I pick different drinks all the time...and is always good...I love their thick toast...and their food is great...I've been to a lot of these Taiwanese boba places..in NYC and SF but this one is my favorite...=)
0,So horribly misplaced in this classic casino.  I so hope the new owners make efforts to rip it out and reorganize this whole (large) section of the casino.
1,"The Cupcake Cafe is so wonderful! The owner, Nicki created the most amazing cupcakes for the 250 guests at my Wedding in October 2011. We had an equal amount of the flavors Wedding Cake, Red Velvet, & Chocolate, all with edible glitter!\n\nPeople were literally sneaking them from the cupcake table, which was hilarious. I'm so happy everyone loved them! Not only that, I still get continuously asked by friends & family 3 months later where I got our cupcakes from, & always send them to Nicki at The Cupcake Cafe :)\n\nYou can see pictures of our cupcakes & cupcake stand Nicki brought for us here:\n\nhttp://theolsenadventures.blogspot.com/2012/01/our-wedding-details.html"
0,"My wife and I were here just 30 mins ago. \n\nI donated money at work and received a Gift Certificate (got lucky from a raffle drawing) to dine at PH. Definitely a tourist restuarant. Food was okay. We had 2 full plates of food left, so we asked for 2 boxes meanwhile waiting for our To-Go meal. When we received our To-Go meal, and asked our waiter about our leftover food. He told us that \""oh i thought you were done with them. My bad.\""\n\nWe could have asked for the manager, but we thought today is Labor Day so we didn't want him to get in trouble. The purpose of this Gift Certificate was for a happy night out, but we were disappointed."
0,"Not sure why this place gets so many raves for their food. Don't get me wrong...the frozen custard is delicious,  but the burgers, hot dogs and stuff are just average. We showed up with some friends who insisted we try the butterburgers. They tasted like Wendy's,  only about 3 times as expensive. The fries weren't bad, but, like everything else in our society, they were salted way too much. If the prices were closer to a regular fast food place I would give them a higher rating."
1,"This place is the BEST!!  Took my son's backpack here after 2 other stores said they couldn't get it stitched in time for school.  Then my son has a small meltdown because we'd have to leave his backpack there overnight to get embroidered (What can I say, he's attached to his backpack). Kenny got it embroidered for me while I waited!!  I have a very happy 6 year old!!  I'll only come to American Stitch from here on out.  Quality work and excellent customer service!!  10 stars as far as I'm concerned."
1,"We love this place. It was our second trip to Il Mulino after a two-year hiatus from Las Vegas. All the tasty nibbles they serve as soon as you sit down are great (parmesano reggiano, salumi, fried zucchini, bruschetta, fresh baked breads). It is expensive but we always feel we receive excellent service and delicious food in large portions. (We'll gladly spend the extra $100 on the tab to feel like we were tried like royalty and enjoyed more than enough food.) They never rush guests here too, which is nice. The ambiance is nice too. Of all the restaurants in Vegas to celebrate our wedding anniversary, we chose this one and it did not disappoint."
0,"I so wanted to love this spa. But sadly, it was a huge disappointment.  I set up apts for my husband and I to get massages. I thought the rates were decent, especially for Vegas. But the minute we walked in, it was like a cattle call. The front desk had a line and you paid before your service (which is rare given that you already have a credit card down to hold the apt) my issue with this is normal spas will add/change massage type based on your and the therapists discussion. Or allow you to add aromatherapy in the room. Not here. You pay in a loud lobby, then are shuffled to a check in area for slippers/robe. This was not relaxing either. there were piles of used slippers and robes, and a desk attendant asking your size and then asking you to step to the side so she can help the group of people behind you. Then you and others are escorted (in a loud fashion) back to the dressing rooms, and they assign you a locker one by one...right down a row. Did I mention, I wasn't there with this group? You get a partial tour and then off they go.\n\nMaybe I am used to upper end spas, but most treat you one on one. They provide you with a calm/quiet tour and ask if they can bring you anything to drink. That isn't the case here. There are carafes of water and paper cups, but nothing fancy. \n\n\nI tried to shake off the noise and undress. I felt weird because most everyone was in a swimsuit. I was not. I had a robe on, but for my steam room and shower and spa I normally am nude. There were a couple other people there who were like me but the majority of the people were suited. \nI showered, again nothing fancy in the way of body lotions/shampoos- just generic  \""shampoo\"" gallons.  It was this way for all the amenities.\n\nWhen I walked by the towel bin by the spa area, some  towels had blood on it. I covered the mess with a towel and walked to the front desk (in my robe) and let them know the towels were over flowing and that there was some sanitation issues.  They thanked me and went back quickly to take care of it. \n\n\nIt was so busy that I couldn't go in the hot tub. It was a normal \""oversized hot tub\"" that maybe 10 people could fit in. There were already 8 or 9 and I wasn't looking to sit super close to strangers. And then the chairs surrounding it were full as well.  \n\nI decided to just do the steam rooms and showers and then wait for my massage.\nThe place is like a maze, but to get to the co-ed space, you have to zig zag down some long haul ways, but you finally find it. It is a cool space. And there is a relaxing salt room. I don't know why it is called that, it is just a warm room, with comfy seats and dim lights for the 'sky'. But it was quiet. Finally.\n\nMy husband even commented how the massage staff just walk around calling out names (loudly) and so it takes away from the relaxing vibe. There was also massage therapists walking into the space, with coffee in hand and carrying all their bags - as if they were just getting to work. \n\nOnto my massage, it was good. Not great. But it was good. I enjoyed the room, the bed was warm. And the massage therapist just did her thing.\nThere was no spa like smells, or scented lotions. But it was nice.\nWhen you are done, they show you cards, and ask you to choose one, but you don't really understand the point until they give you the card and say it is a gift. It is like a motivational bookmark."
0,"Not great at all. Service is horrible. It was slow when my husband and I went, still service was slow as well. Only had a appetizer then went next door to Sandbar where I know I get good service each time."
1,"I need to update my review.  I went to Nourish tonight and was pleasantly surprised.  In the past the food and my service have just been okay.  Tonight, my protein burger with a side of avocado and sweet potato salad were excellent.  Service was good too.  The menu has changed since the last time I visited too.  I will give this place a few more tries!"
1,"I just came back from japan and this is really close to being the real thing.    I've tried all broths (shoyu, miso, tonkotsu) and they're all very good.  Fried rice and the bowls are all legit.  All Japanese staff.  Best thing thats happened to Vegas since Raku."
0,Monkey recently required one of his AC units to be replaced.  His home warranty company contracts with Around the Clock to repair home appliances.  A technician came out and evaluated the AC.  The technician returned the evaluation to Around the Clock but it has taken them over 4 days to submit the claim despite the temperatures over 100 degrees and Monkey having his small baby in the house. Monkey identified this fact to the Manager multiple times over the past few days but to no avail.  It seems the Manager just doesn't care.  Additionally Monkey has a technician come out to evaluate the water heater who seemed quite unusual and made Monkey's wife uncomfortable.
1,"I discovered a little gem. Maybe not little as the space is huge and beautifully set up. Coffee is Illy brand and that speaks for itself. Music is very quiet, you come there to read a book, work, or just stop by to say hi to the nice barista. My new fav coffee place!"
1,"I really enjoyed the bar area for dinner. The server/bartender was one of the best servers I've had. He was friendly, receptive, polite and checked in all the time. I mean when he dropped off a dish, he would say pardon me while I set this dish down.... And this happened at all three courses, appetizer, entree and dessert.\n\nThe food was good and in large portions so it was hard for me to finish everything. For the appetizer, I had the raw oysters. I am generally a fan of west coast small  oysters but these were southern medium oysters so it was only ok for me. For entree, I had the scallop entree which was a huge portion. There were three skewers with two large scallops each and it was plenty for me to take home. The dessert, a chocolate cake was yummy and was a good ending. \n\nThe bar area also had a lot of TVs for sports fans to enjoy the games. \n\nI would definitely come back for drinks and dinner in the bar area."
0,"Really bad experience all around.    We got sat in the main dining room and about 10 minutes later a pompous \""Assistant Manager\"" came and said he has to move us becasue the hostess sat us in a reserved table (the place was pretty dead).   We got sat in the bar area and the air condition was on full blast making it freezing cold.  It took twenty minutes to get a drink order *(which we ordered at our first table,  our apps actually came out before we had our drinks and they didn't even offer us water.  I had 6 differnet tacos,  3 were really good and three were horrible.  The least you could do if you move a group once they've been seated is apologize, maybe offer to buy them a drink, and make sure the rest of their dining experience is enjoyable.  I have a feeling that there will be another restaurant in it's place soon if they don't get their act together."
0,"OMG. What trippy breakfast experience. Someone has teleported Walt Disney's automated breakfast restaurant of the future right out of Epcot Center and on to North 7th Street in Phoenix.\n\nHop on the ride at the door where you pass the menu on the wall. Read fast because this ride doesn't stop. Don't lose your place in line! It's all about queuing here at Disney.\n\nGive your order to the orange, expressionless, automaton robot-babe. Receive a number. Find a table and wait for Disney Magic to happen as dozens of orange robot-babes rush about delivering platters, busing plates and hauling coffee urns.\n\nTables full? Don't worry. Crowd management is covered here at Disney/Scramble. When tables are full, one or two order taking orange robot-babes shut down to reduce the flow into the restaurant. At Disney, everyone gets to the front of the line...and to their share of the breakfast magic...sooner or later.\n\nThe food? Utterly soulless, just like the robot-babes.\n\nRosemary potatoes? Yup. There's potato. There's rosemary. Can't argue with that. \n\nScramble browns? Perfectly formed circle. Browned dark on one side; light on the other. Don't like it too dark? Turn it over!\n\nMultigrain pancakes? Multigrained? Yup. Pancake? Yup. Perfectly round? Yup. Consistently sized? Yup. Too much cinnamon to cover the bland basic mix? Yup. Lots of syrup? Yup!!! Robot-babe, bring more syrup! I say these pancakes are just as good as any frozen Eggo product you're going to find!\n\nPoached egg? It was poached. Nice yellow yolk, just like the safe eggs from Safeway. Served in a nice little cup to keep them from running all over your plate.\n\nScramble Latte? Super sugary!\n\nCoffee? Yes. Bold option? Bold! Regular option? Regular!\n\nALERT! ALERT! ALERT! Someone call Hyatt Place. The orange robot-babes have stolen all their square white plates. They are the perfect dishes for the automated restaurant of the future: unbreakable, stackable, space-saving, and easy to load and remove from an automated dish washing system!\n\nGot a group? No problem! All the tables are sized for two and are portable so they can be moved all around the restaurant to provide seating for a couple, a family or even a whole book club! Be careful though. I would advise against creating any unique arrangements, say such as lining up tables on a 45-degree angle. I suspect the robot-babes could not compute. The entire restaurant could spin out of control and crash. Experiment with caution.\n\nFolks, this food is every bit as good as the \""free breakfast\"" you can get at La Quinta, Holiday Inn Express and Hyatt Place and better automated. Plus you get orange robot-babes! If you like your hotel breakfast, you're gonna LOVE this place."

1,"I love this spot and hike it at least once a week.  There are lots of different trails and few people.  The views are great, hence the name Lookout Mountain.  There are also good mountain biking trails.  It is a short trail to the summit, but steep.  Depending on the trails you take you can make it short and sweet (20-30minutes) or a few hours."
0,"Shopping in a mall has become a thing of the past for me, but I have a gift card that has been burning a hole in my pocket so we decided to do some good old-fashioned shopping in a department store. The store is pretty outdated and I was little disappointed by the lack of inventory to choose from. \n\nI was pretty sad by how little enjoyment I had in this shopping trip. It felt like more of a chore than anything."
1,"It's a really great dive bar. Some nights it's kind of dull, but if you go on the right nights, you'll have a blast."
1,"Four Words: Short Rib Fried Rice. I have actually had other times on the menu (only when going with a group and sampling everyone's dishes), but really I can only order one thing. Such a great blend of spice and flavor. They have many  other traditional dishes and there are a few hard to find beers offered (Kagawa Snow being my personal fav). Pretty cool ambiance for both dinner and lunch, service is friendly but they do get slammed sometimes."
0,"Every time I step into this place, it smells like a used \""street walkers\"" pun\u00faani!  It's cramped, can never walk through the isles with a shopping cart. Not a wide range of vegetables and fruits to choose from. Their sea food looks like it's been covered with ice one too many times or thawed frozen and rethawed! Half their live sea food is swimming upside down dead. It's just a mess!"
0,"I put a reviewed  how bad was their service  to my frown lines injection that was done few months ago. The injection was not placed at the right spot,and then I called them about my concern,and the Doctor said it was fine,like nothing went wrong. I put a review then,and now the bad review was gone. Amazing how they took my review away. Now it,s show  what they can do. Bad service,unprofessional.Wow....it,s all about what they can get from you !"
0,"Generally, I'm a fan of cheap, greasy diner food. This place, however, is just bad. It's overpriced for what you get and the service is awful.  The diner itself could use a little work as well. Our table was sticky and dirty. \n\nMy friend and I stopped here before I moved to Champaign while I was in town looking at some apartments. My friend ordered the grilled cheese with fries and I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries.  Her grilled cheese was basically a piece of American cheese on white bread. That's it. I've made better grilled cheese at home using the same ingredients. There wasn't really much to my chicken sandwich either. \n\nOverall, nothing special. I don't understand the rave reviews of this place at all.  Maybe the breakfast is better? Too bad, I won't be returning. \n\nAlso, I noticed a sign that said NO STUDYING. I guess they want you to just eat your crappy food and GET OUT. \n\nThe location in downtown Champaign seems nicer, but I haven't been in because of the horrible experience I had at the other location. Might give it a try to see if it's any better."
0,"Came here on a Wednesday night, May 9, 2012.\n\nI had been wanting to visit this bar for over a year, but two things held me back.  One, I heard they don't make the handcrafted cocktails on weekends (and apparently busy nights which include Mondays as well?).  Second, I had no one to enjoy a drink with a weekday/night.\n\nBut I was finally able to convince a friend and his group to rendevous here.  The excitement had been built up to a euphoric level... only to be flattened by a cold (male) bartender.\n\nPlease, before any professional bartenders or sympathizers argue that one can't always be greeting patrons with a smiling face, and enthusiastic welcome... shut the fuck up.  You're in the hospitality business, and it's your job.  If you wanna be called a professional, act like it.  And I felt extra jipped because I always tip well on drinks (or at least a respectable dollar tip per drink for shitty service, which is what I got that night).\n\nMy Vegas-local friend told me that that's the way things are everywhere in Vegas, cause tourists don't bother leaving tip oftentimes, so the bartenders don't see the payout as especially rewarding for such a difficult thing as a smile.\n\nTo be honest, the cocktails were quite interesting.  There was one that used strawberry jam, and it was very tasty.  I wish I could remember the names, but the bartender seemed too busy to bother again.\n\nHey, it's a sleek-lookin place, with a soothing lavender ambiance.  It's right in middle of Cosmo, which to me is the hottest hotel in Vegas right now, so the people watching can be great.  The handcrafted cocktails were what I was looking for.  But, as with my complaint with Scarpetta, I came to Vegas to have a good time...  not to feel like some asshole demanding special treatment, and putting the bartender out.  Cosmo, you were a night of fail."
0,"So.. My cousins and I went here because we were craving pho and spring rolls, ordered those two. Waited patiently for our food. I noticed that the table next to us got their food a lot faster than us. After getting their attention 10 minutes later, we let Travis our waiter know that we ordered spring rolls and pot stickers. Still waited patiently... Got the pot stickers half way through our meal and asked for a box because we were already full. Not to mention that I still never got my spring rolls. After the meal we let Travis know again that we would like a box for the pot stickers and that we still NEVER got our spring rolls. He immediately said he would cancel our order (that's cool, not like I wanted them or anything. *sarcasm intended) an apology was never said, but he did throw in a $2.00 discount on our entire check. THANKS BUDDY. Worst customer service I've had."
0,"First time I've had a $20 haircut with a hammer and sickle.  Truly the first rush job haircut I've ever had in all of ten minutes from start to finish.  Don't know what the rush was.  I was the the first and last in the wait line.  After all the glowing reviews, I expected an impresario, not a rough go-round with Freddy Kreuger.   Bottom-line, it was an OK haircut, but for the price I would've expected a little more than the same result I could've had from Cheap Clips."
1,"We went there for my husband's birthday. I made a reservation online on their website the same day. It was very convenient. The atmosphere is very intimate and romantic. Staff was friendly, our waiter was polite and professional. We decided for the 4 course menu and had traditional Swiss cheese fondue (the kirschwasser was a little too bitter for my husband. I liked it, but since I have lived in Switzerland and have had real Swiss fondues there its kinda hard to impress me;) lol). The mushroom and spinach salad was ok, nothing special. The entree was by far my favorite. There was ahi tuna, shrimp, teriyaki beef and thin slices of steak, and chicken, plus fresh mushrooms,  broccoli, and potatoes. The chocolate fondue was pretty tasty as well. I asked to substitute marshmallows for extra strawberries and they brought us an extra bowl of strawberries. I thought that was nice. And there was a birthday candle on the cheesecake for my husband. The experience is a little pricy but well worth it. Will probably go back for another special occasion."
0,"Our second day in Montreal we wanted to try something different for breakfast.  Meaning, not a chain, and not just pastries and coffee/tea.  We had spied this place the other day and it looked intriguing, although the menu out front wasn't totally clear, the sign saying \""breakfast served all day\"" was pretty clear.  \n\nWe were there at 9:40.  Took about 10 minutes to get anyone to notice us in the empty and freezing shop.  We were told the kitchen doesn't open until 10 (this was a weekday!).  No suggestion to sit and wait with some espresso, no offer to look at the menu.  Not a good start.  We went next door and got a drink (a missed sale! empolyees of Marche).  I convinced my dinning partner to come back and try again.  Probably was a bad idea.\n\nWhat I had was good.  Let me say that first off.  The service was not up to snuff but as long as it isn't horrible I can usually handle that.  Waiting for the cook to get to work was a bit of a trial, about 40 minutes.  The people next to us ordered croque monsieur and waited nearly an hour while the staff filled the deli case instead of making their meal.  When they complained a manager type made them in about 30 seconds.  hmmmmm... another bad sign!\n\nI tried the omelet special, which was more of souffl\u00e9.  I'm not an omelet conisure but it was nice.  The ham, bacon, cheese, pat\u00e9, fruit and bread was all good and really more than I typically have for breakfast but a nice treat.  What wasn't good was putting a salad on top of all of that on a warm plate next to the piping hot dish that held the omelet/souffle thing.  Which creates  a  wilted salad as anyone will tell you.  But here is the kicker, my companion ordered the fruit crepe.  It came out looking like a burrito, which is not the end of the world and could be interesting.  While it was filled with fresh fruit, most of that fruit hadn't been properly cleaned.  The cantaloupe still had the rind on it!  And the crepe was chrispy like it had been fried or something.  I have no idea how you do that to a crepe.  Maybe this is a regional variation I'm not aware of but when you got to hack at your crepe with a chisel to get at hard cantaloupe rind something is not Kosher.  \n\nLike the hair that was served with the crepe.  \n\nI wanted this place to be better.  It is cute and interesting and I wanted to sample all the things in their deli case.  But I'm not coming back for $15 a person breakfast that isn't served until lunch and isn't properly prepared.  Should have gotten pastries at Olive+Gourmando."
0,"We've been here many, many times. Mostly for the same reasons everyone goes here: the gorgeous patio, the margaritas, and the warm homemade tortillas. That being said, when we were here last night and my husband \""checked in\"" he was surprised to see only two stars. So we discussed and realized that what really kills this place every time is the service. Which is unfortunate, because they usually have a good product. \n\nUntil last night the food has been pretty good, not spectacular but again we go for the 3 reasons mentioned above. Last night though, I think I'd had it. We had our trifecta but it simply wasn't enough. The service was awful and my meal was served cold and tasted like it had been sitting around for 30 min. Which is probably the case because it took a rather long time to come out. I ordered the tesoro del mar which is basically a salad with jumbo shrimp. I've gotten it many times and the flavors are usually good. Last night the shrimp was stone cold and hard--I had trouble cutting it with my knife. \n\nOur server was MIA most of the evening, and when she did show up it was to try to get us to order more drinks after we told her we had our fill at the bar waiting for our table. We had to request the tortillas because she didn't automatically bring them out, she was delayed with our check and with taking our bill after I was clearly fed up and wanted to leave. \n\nI think I'm done. After I work all day, going out to eat is a treat. Going here again is not worth my hard-earned money or my aggravation."
0,"This review is LONG overdue!  \n\nI used Warren's after getting a recommendation.  I read the reviews on Yelp and they seemed great.  Well I hope you will read this before deciding to hire them.  \n\nI was moving from Vegas to California.  Warren's sent over someone to the house for an estimate - he was very nice and accommodating.  In fact, I called in a bit of a panic thinking I was not ready for them to come the following day and he said my house was the most organized he had ever seen.  I did have quite the system down with a whole alpha numeric system which showed what went to storage and what went to the new house.\n\nOn moving day, 4 guys showed up and I will say they did a great job in Vegas.  What happened on the way to California turned this move into an absolute nightmare!\n\nI unfortunately was not able to meet the movers when they arrived in California so I sent two assistants to meet them at the storage unit.  I got calls and texts repeatedly from the girls who said the movers were just shoving things in the storage with no order and when they asked the guys to move it into an orderly state, they were told \""if you want it done that way you can do it yourself.\""  I was at my first day of a new job and couldn't really drop everything and go down there.  Now of course there is the whole he said she said thing but after seeing the MESS my two storage units were left in, the she said portion of the conversation is the truth.  These guys were awful!  Several months later, I am still left with things I can't access because they decided to leave wardrobe boxes at the very very back and bottom of the unit with MASSIVE amounts of furniture in front of the boxes.  WHO DOES THAT!?  They had specific instructions to put the furniture in one unit and the storage totes and wardrobe boxes in another.  NOPE, they just threw stuff in as it came off the truck.  I have photos of totes thrown to the very back and very top of my unit.  IMPOSSIBLE to access!\n\nI called Warren's to complain and they pretty much told me \""too bad.\""  I asked to talk to the owner, I was denied.  I called back multiple times to speak to the owner and was denied.  I called to talk to the woman who originally handled everything for me and was denied.  They had my money and they did not care!\n\nWhy am I writing this review so much later?  Well another move forced me to hire movers once again.  They moved several dozen storage totes, wardrobe boxes and furniture out of my house and to the same storage unit as my other belongings.  They put everything in a VERY orderly fashion, asked what needed to go where and they wanted to make sure I could access the things I needed to access.  They did a great job!  I showed them the MESS that Warren's left me and their jaws literally and I mean literally dropped.  They could not believe it.  When I told them I had actually straightened some of it out, they just looked at me and said \""I'm so sorry!\""  \n\nDO NOT USE WARREN'S HOMEWORK unless you want to hire new movers to fix the mess they will leave.  Oh yes, and it was lovely to discover today that my $2500 Armoire has the knobs broken off the front.  Thanks Warren's!  Karma...that's all I have to say!"
0,"I'm usually a Wingstop fan but when I had a wing craving on a budget, I suggested Buffalo Wild Wings to my husband because their wings are $0.45 on Tuesdays. I haven't eaten here in 4 years because the last couple of times were gross, but I decided to give it another try and after tonight, never again Buffalo Wild Wings. \n\nWe ordered 15 spicy garlic and 15 Asian zing traditional bone-in wings, large fries, veggie sticks, and 3 ranches. The quality of the wings seemed lesser than those of Wingstop; they were small, tough, and over cooked. The spicy garlic sauce was a typical hot sauce with a bit of garlic flavor and the Asian zing was sweet and boring topped with red chili flakes. Although neither of which were actually spicy like their names implied, I definitely prefer the \""spicy\"" garlic. \n\nThe large fries looked like a medium from McDonald's. When we order a large fry from Wingstop, I've had 4 adults and two children work on it but never managed to finish it whereas my husband and I alone were able to kill these fries. The veggies had really stringy, strangely bright green celery, and baby carrots. The tiny ranches, which cost 60 cents each, tasted like they came from a bottle of Hidden Valley. \n\nWhen I pulled up to pick up my food at 8:30 PM, the place was packed with people parking in the adjacent desert. The girls in the front tilted my box of Asian zing on the side so all of the sauce spilled over the boxes and the bag. Since I haven't eaten here in so long, I thought that the box was holding something which should be stood vertically, but if I worked here and saw to-go bags going out constantly, I would have noticed it and fixed it. So I guess some people like to come here for the scene and the game, but if you're looking for a good wing meal to-go, this is definitely not the place to get it from."
1,"So expensive but so good! I walked up around 2pm by myself and was able to find a seat at the bar right away, avoiding a 40 minute long line. It's on the 2nd floor of the Cosmo.\n\nI ordered the Rising Sun burger and a Grasshopper shake. Service was very fast and friendly.\n\nThe burger was super rich in flavor but you have to make sure you bite where the sauce is! The fries were wonderful and the shake was so good."
0,Save your money...super rude drivers and brain dead cashiers.  They were absolutely the worst experience.  I'll pay more. Do not use these people. They need to be put of business.
0,"It's really funny. Having read through some of the reviews on yelp I was expecting the ramen broth to be really salty. It was the opposite of salty. It was completely flavorless water. \n\nThis is what we ordered: pickled vegetables to share between a few people, pork buns, pork and chives dumplings (\""the classic\"") and the miso ramen.  Others in the table got the tonkotsu ramen and miso ramen with pork belly. \n\nThe pickled vegetables came on a long plate and there were just a few pieces of each thing. It was a bit disappointing/ridiculous how little of each thing there was. For example: 3 extremely thin slices of carrot. The dish came with cauliflower, some type of green, radish, and carrot. The way it was all arranged on the plate showed they were trying for something classy that really missed the mark. The flavors followed suit as it all tasted the same, of overpowering sweet pickling juice. Would never ever order this again.\n\nThen came the dumplings. These were not so bad really. About decent, pretty salty but I think well cooked. Would never go here for the dumplings but if I was forced to come again I would be content just eating these as a snack.\n\n Then the buns. I guess as a personal note, I don't like this trendy slider-style for buns; what's wrong with just a good bao. But regardless, the sauce (hoisin) was too sweet and clashed with whatever else was inside. And it was full of sauce. Whatever reviewers said these buns were good have clearly not had even decent buns. Just because you're using pork belly doesn't make them good. \n\nFinally, for the least *umami* part of the meal...the ramen. It was so flavorless... watery broth, megh noodles. The slices of chicken looked and tasted drab, most of the sprouts were not even whole but either chopped or just broken. Finally, wow, one sheet of the most tasteless seaweed I have ever had. Not a single ingredient in this soup was redeemable. We ended up adding all the soy sauce that we got for our dumplings  plus part of the garlic sauce that came with the tonkotsu ramen that someone else ordered and it was still completely flavorless. I have never called a soup trashwater before today. Others in our table were also completely unimpressed. A ramen place with horrible ramen...I hope they shut down soon so something else can take its place. I wish restaurants would just focus on having good ingredients and cooking things well, but instead we get generic and bland food. \n\nAt the end of the night, we can cook better ramen at home by just cutting up some carrots and onions throwing them in the broth with some semi-decent korean noodles and then cracking an egg in there...\n\n...In response to the other reviewer: I guess not all white people love Umami.\n\nSeriously, you may be sitting around debating where to go. Maybe you have eaten all your favorite restaurants recently and want to try something new. Do NOT eat here if you want a good meal. We were debating between multiple restaurants and this came up because no one had tried it. If you find yourself in the same situation, put your foot down and don't let this ruin your night too."
1,"The MGM Grand hotel and casino is by far the best hotel and casino in Las Vegas! Every time I visit Vegas I make it a point to all my friends and family that I will only stay at the MGM. From the hotel side the staff is very friendly and will try their best to accommodate your every need. This truly is one of the classiest places in Vegas and it is worth every penny. The rooms are beautiful and decorated stupendously. The views from some of the room are breathtaking and every time I sleep in one of their massive king sized beds I wake up feeling like a million bucks, even after I lose at the black jack tables! They let me check in early and check out late and will even hold onto your luggage if you would like to hang around Vegas the day of your flight but did not pay for another night. The price per night is not too expensive as long as you book in advance and possibly book as a package. The average per night when I have gone has been around $80 which isn't bad when you have 2-4 people splitting the cost.\n\nThe casino aspect of this place is just as good. The poker room is my favorite in all of Vegas from the high quality poker chips to the amazing race track designed poker tables. The dealers are good and most of them have worked there for many years. The poker room provides games for virtually any skill level starting at $2-$4. They also host a variety of tournaments including SnG and regular buy-in tournament structures. The chairs you play in are fit for a king and there is a bar right next to it that plays some nice music. The poker room is also surrounded by flat screens for the sports enthusiasts. When I go to Vegas to play poker I make sure this is my first stop!\n\nThe table games are great as well. This casino is decently sized and features many tables of different games for different bank roll sizes. Most casinos will have either higher limits or tiny ones but the MGM provides a nice middle ground for those looking to have a blast. Last time I came here I cleaned up at the roulette and black jack tables and payed for my trip!\n\nI will be back in Vegas in a couple of months and I can not wait to visit my home away from home, the MGM Grand."
1,"Valerie S basically said everything I wanted to a week ago, but I wanted to make sure to write them another 5 star review. \n\nWe got the Yelp deal so for $47 our group got a free drink at the first bar, transportation on the party bus, terribly sugary alcoholic drinks on the party bus, and entry to three clubs. We went to Drais, Tao and Chateau and at the end of the trip I keep thinking back about how incredibly cheap this club crawl was. The hosts were very friendly and the bus was a great time. If I go back to Vegas I would not think twice about doing this again."
1,I stayed here for the Mexico v USA game in April of 2014. It was $95 and met all of our needs. It was clean and the AC was strong. Parking was easy and I loved the free breakfast and wifi. If you're on a budget this is a good choice. I'm also partial to the El Pollo loco next door.
1,"Friendly staff, decent coffee and good strong Wi Fi. That pretty much covers the bases for a 4 star Starbucks review..."
1,"I'm writing this review for the only two things I order at this joint, which is their grilled pork banh mi and their broken rice special combo plate. Both are YUMMEEHHH!\n\nI love the combo plate because they do NOT skimp on your meat. It comes with all the delicious stuff on it, with scrumptious nuoc cham on the side, and generous cucumber and tomato. The rice is plentiful, the meat is tasty. The sandwich had deliciously light, crisp bread and they are reasonably generous with the meat. I've had \""the real deals\"" out in California so it's kind of hard to put them on the same pedestal, but as far as Vegas is concerned, they are pretty damn good. I love the avocado shake too- thick, not too sweet, with good boba. It was a nice cap to the meal."
0,"The donuts are good, but they aren't great.  They have innovative toppings that sometimes just fall flat because the actual small donuts base flavor isn't very good itself.  They are also ridiculously expensive for the size of donuts.  I prefer dunkin donuts - they simply know what they are doing.  This place also has attitude, they think they are the shit, and act like it too.  I've seen the owner, and he's not super nice or helpful.  I've also heard about his opinions and I don't care for them.  Although this review is based solely on the taste of the donuts and their service.  I'm not impressed with either."
1,"This place is right in my neighborhood, but I always seem to forget it's there! Finally tried it out last night and I was very impressed. I LOVED the trio of salsas they serve with their chips...especially the green one! It is fantastic and so flavorful. I ordered chicken enchiladas with green sauce, and they were delicious. Normally enchiladas come drowning in cheese, but these one were not and you could really taste the flavor of the enchilada sauce. Their charro beans were very good as well; definitely a nice alternative to refried beans. I can't wait to go back here and try some of their other dishes!"
1,"There are huge matzoh balls in the soup here. However, the soup is a little on the bland side - I had to add a lot of pepper.\n\nA slice of New York style cheesecake is ridiculously big. I started out helping someone on his dessert and thought there was no way we'd finish. Little did I know this would be the best cheesecake I'd ever tasted, so polishing it off was easy.\n\nThis is one of the cheapest good places to eat on the strip."
0,"What a mediocre attempt at French cuisine. If I wanted a basket fit for a rabbit of raw vegetables, I would have brought it myself....tomatoes where hard and not ripe.  It should have been a centerpiece.  Foie GRAS was served cold...was it p\u00e2t\u00e9 ...I thought I paid and ordered Foie GRAS. Lamb had no taste, mashed potatoes tasted like they came from a box...hard bread, frozen butter.  The American steak...was hard though meat with a gamey tasting sauce that was overpowering and nauseating.  Could not wait to leave, but had ordered the souffle...which was mediocre as well...."
0,"The room was actually quite decent, service was okay and the pyramid was a nice spectacle. But the cons really outweigh the pros. There is NO wireless! NONE! If you like using things like an ipad or other tablets, don't stay here. They have free wired internet, so if your bringing your laptop that wouldn't be terrible.  The hotel had time share people stationed almost every 10 feet. It was really annoying. The buffet was decent and cheap, but I will be staying somewhere else next time because of the wireless issue!"
1,"Five stars for being the fastest fast food place I have ever been to.  I get my food within 30 seconds of paying every time.  Food wise its a chick fil a, so not great.  Bit if I need a fast unhealthy lunch its great to have a place I can get in and out of in 2 minutes with my food."
1,"So, So Glad I gave this place a 2nd chance. This time was excellent from start to finish. Server 1088, Cassand (I am presuming that is short for Cassandra?) had a bright, cheery disposition and maintained that attitude throughout my visit. Beer was exceptionally cold in a frosted pint, and my Burger and fries, which were perfection, was in front of me within literally minutes of ordering. Glass of ice water and an ice-cold bottle of water for refills was presented without asking. Very fair prices. Wonderful experience. SO MUCH BETTER done than my last visit. Cheers!"
1,"The service was fantastic! It was our birthday so he hooked us up with free ice cream sundaes and was very friendly. We had the chicken wings which were pretty good size and I'm still craving them. We also split a cheeseburger in paradise. This is suppose to be their signature burger but I didn't really care for it.too messy, flavor was boring and it was just a regular burger.nothing special about it.all in all, it was a good experience...primarily because of the service."
0,I ate here while staying in the quad hotel with my boyfriend we wanted something close by and it looked like a nice restaurant. We didn't have too much time to wait.  The waiter was very nice we both had a big lunch so wanted something small and not too much carbs so went with the chilli. I just had a few spoonfuls and my stomach started to feel really sick couldn't eat any more might have been too spicy and salty. My boyfriend ate all of his but spent the night extremely ill I felt really sorry for him. I won't be racing back to try the chilli it needs to be improved.
1,"Wow, the 300th review.  I should get a free diet coke!\n\nThis buffet is advertised as the largest buffet in Vegas, but it's probably by a two or three foot margin.   \n\nWe went there for lunch and snuck past the line because we were actually paying cash, instead of using a casino comp ($16.99 is cheaper than an hour at the tables)  There was a machine for fast pays that came in very handy for this.\n\nWe were sat promptly and took off for the experience.  I didn't really give our waitress a chance to greet us but I noticed that there was no silverware on the table so I inquired with a roaming chef who was very nice.  When the waitress came by, she said that she was going to bring silverware too.\n\nAnyway,  the variety here was not that impressive at lunch.  They did have a fairly decent array of dishes though and the food was all properly prepared.   I was bummed that they didn't have whipped cream to put onto my Cookies and Cream gelato, but  I guess i would just have to do with some M&M's and a sub 1000 calorie dessert.\n\nService was friendly and prompt.  Overall it was pretty good.  I am eager to try the Seafood Buffet here.  I heard that it's worth every penny of the 40 bucks you pay."
0,Quick tip: don't order the spring roll for an appetizer.
0,"I am editing my review and adding a star because of the owner's thoughtful and sincere response to my earlier posting. I really appreciate when a business owner takes the time to respond to online reviews and I would love to see this particular restaurant do well. As a vegan it means a lot to me when restaurants offer vegetarian alternatives. While my first experience wasn't the most positive, I can see that others have had much better experiences. It may have been an off day, so I will keep an open mind and maybe stop back the next time I'm in the area."
0,"I purchased an ice cream cake from this location, so my review is solely based on the \""cake\"". \n\nI picked the cake up from the freezer section - 10 inch with decorations for about $27. The cashier offered to add writing for free, but I passed on that.\n\nThe cake held up pretty well in the summer heat in the 20 minutes that it took me to get home. Points for being firm?\n\nI think it's really wrong to call the concoction a cake. There's absolutely no cake in the \""cake\"". There's some sort of cookie crumble in the center of overly sweet chocolate and vanilla ice cream. It's frosted like a cake. I will add that the frosting was tasty. I was just missing the cake.\n\nI guess I shouldn't give them too hard of a time. Crab cakes do exists, so maybe the name is based on the shape?"
1,"Well to start, it's Chili's, you know what they serve up. I've been to this location on several occasion and have always left satisfied. The greeting, service & food have always been what you should expect from this chain. Pretty good happy hour specials as well! Cheers!"
1,"Dined at Central Bistro, it was wonderful.  We had the Drunk Bread for an appetizer, it was absolutely delicious.  I had the seared Salmon  with artichokes, haricot vert (string beans), purple potatoes in a lobster sauce.  It was absolutely delicious.  Friends had  the peanut thai salad & pasta with clams.  Everyone enjoyed their dinner.  It was a little on the pricey side for me, but well worth the food.  I would eat there again in a hearbeat~"
0,"It is a busy location.  Small but people were nice.  The only problem was there are no outlets.  Make sure your laptops and tablets are charged up if you want to hang out here.  It was frustrating to have stopped, thinking I was going to get some work done, and my laptop died.  There was no where to plug it in.  There were tables against the windows but even the tables near a wall didn't even have an outlet.  Very frustrating."
1,Famous Uncle Al's hot dogs and Grill is one great hot dog place!  We made sure we had one more hot dog before going home.  I highly recommend them if you are looking for a great hot dog.
0,"With all of the stellar reviews both online and personal I see and hear about this place it is most disheartening to have had a negative experience.  Initially I was impressed.  The people that work here were most friendly and welcoming upon my consultation. However the person I was working with dropped communication and stood me up for an appointment.  I feel that everyone has the right to cancel but it's common courtesy to notify your scheduled appointments before they arrive.  Surely we are entitled to make mistakes, however this experience has left me feeling under valued for my time and money.  \nI came to this shop for a new and improved tattoo experience.  I left with my first experience of a no call no show artist and ended up back to square one on my search for new and improved experience."
0,"Food and service were excellent, but the techno music blasting in an endless loop made it almost impossible to have a conversation and forced us to rush through dinner, leaving with headaches. Maybe just not our scene, but won't be back."
0,"I should have read the reviews first.....big mistake on my part.\n  \nWent to this steakhouse last night with my wife and her parents.  The place was empty except for  one 8 top that didn't look real happy as they were paying they're bill and heading out the door. (bad sign #1 and #2) The service was good and the salad bar was ok.  However; when the meat products started arrive is when it got real bad.  All beef items on their menu tasted like liver and chewed like a tough tire.  Just terrible.  My wife stopped eating, followed by her father then her mom. All with the same look on their face.  The rest of the meat items just tasted like salt....lots of salt.  \n\nWith a fixed ticket price of $33 per person we were looking forward to a wonderful dinning experience.  We would have eaten better across the street at the Waffle House.  \n\nNot wanting to complain with my wife's parents along for the meal I thought I would call today and express our experience to the manager.  So I call and ask for the manager.  After a bit of a wait I got a gentlemen who spoke very poor English and from his first word, about the rudest person I've ever dealt with.  He basically said I was crazy, his products were fine, and he never receives complaints as such (yeah right)  After going nowhere with this guy for 5 minutes or so I find out he is the owner.  Wow is all I could think.  \n\nThis place should not be in business.......someone is going to get sick from their food.  \n\nAll of these reviews below mine don't lie.....DON'T EAT HERE.\n\nAlso I hope your smarter than I and read these reviews before you go and spend a fortune on disgusting food."
1,"I'd sworn off Shogun for a long time.  I used to drive from Central PHX up here just for their Shogun Chicken.  The food has always been awesome, but the last three times I'd been here, the service was beyond abysmal.  One night I'd come in specifically to tie one on with a meal, but I could only manage to get the waitress's attention for three drinks.  Kinda ridiculous.  So I was pleasantly surprised on my last visit.  We were told the table would be 10-15 minutes; we were seated in five.  Iced tea and water never reached empty.  And the food was incredible, as always.  I'm not much of a fish-eater, so I can't reliably rate their sushi, but I've always loved what I've had here. The Chicken Katsu is also very good.  I hope the good service we experienced indicates a wholesale change and was not just an anomaly.  But after being this close to calling it quits on this place entirely (and I've been eating here for 15+ years), they redeemed themselves.  I really hope they keep it up."
0,Was told $63 for trip to airport. When we got to airport. Eric Heywood the manager who picked us up he charged 70$  I wasn't happy. \nHe talks to much and is dishonest. Not a good deal. Very disappointed. Also is rude to clients while calling. Do not use this taxi company
1,really good burger - wow real meat. Nice atmosphere. Good selection of local and imported beer. Great shakes as well.
1,very friendly staff and bartender. Very inexpensive and good. Bar food only.\nQuaint!
0,"Be ready to wait when you come Madison East USCC.  Often have to wait 45-60 minutes. When you finally get to see an agent, they are always very helpful, pleasant, and patient. The employees seem very well trained. One downfall they have, and I have experienced this many times, is that the agent cannot take care of everything at their computer terminal. For some reason they always need to \""call-in\"" some issues to the central office for some far-away person to perform a task for them. That itself wouldn't be bad, except that they are always put on hold for a long uncomfortable period of time.\nUs. cellular desperately needs to find some efficiencies in their customer service"
0,After reading your reviews I'm glad I don't live there.  Just to note: False advertising... there are no apartments at $677.  And what is up with the mooch fees.  Geez
1,"If I wrote a full review you'd never read it... it would be too long. We had nearly everything on the darn menu.\n\nEverything here is between excellent to amazing, except the deserts which are so-so - more on that later.\n\nBe warned... this place is very expensive. I would not spend my own $ here... it is at least 30% too expensive IMO compared to other places I go of this caliber. But, if you want to drop $100/person (not including drinks) and want good food... try it.\n\nAnything cooked gets 5 stars: lamb, black cod, and about everything else is great. \n\nSushi gets 3 stars: it is just OK - they do a few things that are good but nothing beyond 4 stars and that is pushing it. The fish selection is not very big so they need to step it up there is they really want to be a top place to go for just sushi.\n\nThe deserts were Meh. The only thing good was the sorbets and they were good, not great.\n\nOverall I had a great meal, we ate a lot and the cooked dishes made the meal... good thing I did not have to pay for it."
1,LOVE IT!  They are overly friendly to a point we were like OK.  LOL!  Love the smell that hits you in the face when you open the door.  CHOCOLATE!  POOW!  They had a lot of things to pick from.
0,"Paid in full for a 3 night stay in advance for my son's birthday. When he arrived, the hotel was \""oversold\"" and his reserved suite was not available. I left a message & sent an email asking for an explanation. No response. I've never stayed here but it appears they need to work on customer service"
0,"No organic 2% milk, which is in the farthest corner of the planet from the entrance, because no one would go into a grocery store for just milk, right???\nAnd the cashier couldn't have been any more rude. No thank you, no smile, actually even seemed annoyed that we were disturbing his quiet evening since there were hardly any customers n all were mostly going thru the self checkout"
0,"They really should take the \""Pizza\"" out of their name.  I just had a \""red pie\"": pizza with sausage, onion, green pepper and mushroom; my favorite combo, and it was the most sorry excuse for a pizza I have ever had.  Beer seems to flow aplenty but forget calling it Revolution PIZZA!"
0,"Late night stop in with the wife on Saturday night and there were 4 guys working the bar area. The place was not to crowded for a Saturday night so I was a little surprised to be ignored. Finally the tall guy with dark hair came and acknowledged us, served the beers and provided the bill since we were only there for one round. Pretty decent guy. $18 bar tab so I figured I would put $5 on for tip. \n\nNo sooner do I lay the pen down then the Mr. Rude Dude bald goatee bartender grabs it and rings it out. No acknowledgement whatsoever when taking or seeing the tip. He goes about his way to then help the next group. I could over hear the conversation and whatever the woman ordered he said, \""how about the Apple Cider\"" which was some drink on tap....\""it is easier to make than the drink\"". Sounding a bit on the lazy side if you ask me.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I know that places like this pool their tips, but it annoys the hell out of me to put a little extra down in the tip area for the person that served you all to have someone else take the tab away and the original person having no idea of your generosity. Freaking Rude. \n\nAfter watching Mr. Rude Dude for then next 15 minutes it was blatantly obvious he was there to shuffle in the register as many tabs as he could. Maybe he needs to return to working at the traveling carnival where that behavior is expected."
0,"This restaurant was far from great. With a price of $17+ for pasta I expected great. I had the Gorgonzola chicken pasta and I expected a deliciously rich and creamy pasta. Instead I could only describe this as tasting like pasta from a cafeteria. So disappointing. \n\nThey were kid friendly, which was helpful. They had good bread and we had a pretty decent clam appetizer. My hubby had some tasty prime rib as well.\n\nThey took care of the pasta which I appreciated. Overall, they were friendly and accommodating but the food just wasn't  worth the price."
1,"I went to the Boiling Crab on New Years Eve, Service was Great and the Food was Good!I"
1,Had dinner there with family on Saturday. Celebrated an anniversary with my in-laws who love this restaurant.\n\nI had the biggest pork chop I have ever seen. It was delicious and really hit the spot.\n\nI tried the Carrot soup which had ginger and coconut in it. Outstanding. \n\nThe wine selection was great and our table had a few bottles to compliment the dinner.\n\nThe view there is terrific and the service was great as well.
1,"good price, good food, good service, what more can you ask for.  one of my favorite places.  they always make you feel so welcome!"
0,"I'd been looking to try this restaurant for over a year now, since I moved into Little Italy. Known as one of the few \""good\"" burrito places in Montreal, my girlfriend and I went and each tried a different one (vegetarian & beef) to get a feel for it. To summarize the experience, I found the service slow, the atmosphere distracting and overwhelming, but most disappointing of all was the incredibly overpriced and overrated burritos. For $15 (veg) & $17 (beef), we each received burritos that were half the size of a usual burrito you'd find at Chilenita, M4, or really anywhere else in this burrito-deficient city, and were much less delicious. So, for double the price of a burrito anywhere else, you can head to Nacho Libre for a burrito that tasted like they had nothing in them but green peppers and ranch sauce - and made our stomachs hurt for the next 24 hours. Save your self a waste of time and money."
1,Really amazing food. Great breakfast sandwiches prepared well and creative mixes of ingredients. Unique food you won't find anywhere else and at a price that'll ensure you keep coming back.\nI'd been looking to try Cracked for a long time and was thrilled to finally get the chance the other week. Looking forward to trying Cracked again next time I'm in Champaign.
0,Update # 3...OK we went for our 'great experience'. It was ok. Massages themselves were good-to-great. Nothing else was improved. No follow-up from the manager considering the situation. I promise you that you can find something better to do with $175.
1,"I have only been here once, but I plan to go back. This coffee shop has a warm and comforting atmosphere with a fantastic view of the lake and downtown Madison. Groups of knitters gather here, which can get a little loud at times. The prices are slightly higher than other Madison coffee shops, but the quality was very good. I think this would be a great place to bring out-of-towners."
1,"It was a rare for me that during my college years of blossoming into manhood that I didn't start my night by a trip to Walgreen's. It was also rare that I didn't traumatize the clerk with my purchases.\n\nDuring the period of time when Keith Charles was known as \"" Whiskeysaurus Rex\"" or \""Bad Fritz\""  and it was common that the following items were being purchased prior to a big night out on the town.\n\n1. Glow Sticks\n2. Condoms\n3. Met Rx Protein Bar with 32 grams of whey protein isolate\n4. Altoids- Cinamon\n5. Marb lights\n6. Monster Energy Drink (low carb to keep my girlish figure)\n7.

0,"I wasn't a fan of the place. Not trying to be rude, the bread was stale. When we walked in there was only one other person during the lunch hour. Our order had several mistakes too. I would be hesitant to come back after this."
0,"I went here a couple times then stopped.  The bartenders are WAY to into themselves, which is probably the reason the service sucks.  What this place needs is people interested in serving the customer not posing.  I don't need to be looked down on by the people slinging drinks. And it's too bad cause I like the owner."
1,"Go there quite often when playing poker at Venetian. The food is really good, there is a nice atmosphere, staff is nice, they have a huge selection and everyone seems to always enjoy their dishes. I wish they had more choices for vegans and one vegan dessert but there are a few menu options that can be tweaked for vegans, so it works . Bonus for late nighters... this location is open 24 hours :)"
0,"Not a fan. \n\nLiving in Charlotte, NC for a couple years I got pretty familiar with US Airways as they have a choke hold on CLT. You can't get out of the frikken state on that airline for less than $400 no matter where you are going. Still it was the easy choice so I flew it a lot. Sometimes paying for convenience is worth it. \n\nRecently, I took them back from Jamaica with a layover in CLT and can't say I was too impressed. On one hand, they got us home earlier and adverted a potential delay. Plus, I was on a couple of the newest planes (complete with wi-fi) I have ever been on. \n\nOn the other hand, they cut our layovers so short it made us run for every plane! They charged $25/bag for an international flight (I didn't even know any airlines charged for the first bag on international - apparently US Air is one of only a few). Oh and they didn't seat my husband and I together, even though none of our flights were full and they easily could have!? \n\nI think I will skip them in the future."
1,"For me and my wife we went in had dinner again tonight we got the app special guac and salsa and chips and ordered a wise guy pizza and had some drinks, they were busy but the staff was attentive and the food was amazing, we love what this place is about also at 8pm the place their muffins, turnovers, and coffee cakes on sale for 50% off, yum. \n\nThis is a great place to have a nice meal and a unwind me drink!!"
0,"Cute, bright and loud.  Waitresses in little black dresses. That is the best I can say about the place. Food was barely ok.  Ribs no big deal and the Southeast Asian Salad I ordered came without the ginger, coriander, bean sprouts and salted peanuts advertised.  They didn't even put any dressing on it and once I asked for it the dressing didn't make it much better.  It was a lump of tasteless pulled chicken on some lettuce with some snow peas thrown on it.  Obviously no one in the kitchen has ever read the menu.  Plus - what bar doesn't carry bourbon??"
0,"I'm giving Bunky's at least 2 stars for now, because I may have ordered something off the menu that's really not their specialty.  First let me start by saying the atmosphere and manager are two very strong points.  I have a gluten allergy which is one of the reasons my partner and I decided to go here and I'm pleased to say that they offer a lot in gluten free.  Don't even bother with the garlic bread however, it's not more than mush and no garlic.  The prices are kinda high so we asked right away if they thought the proportions were big enough for two people and she said, \""yes\"".  But then when it came time to eat it was a small piece of their veggie lasagna and we were only hungrier then when we came in.  You are served a tiny spot of salad(with amazing dressing), a sliver of soggy gluten free garlic bread (for 1.50 extra) and then a small smackerel of lasagna.  The lasagna was very bla.  But like I was saying there are so many other amazing things on the menu like the whole Mediterranean side of the menu.  So overall I was fairly disappointed but willing to give in one more try."
0,"The last few times I have came to forever 21 in down town Summerlin , I have been disappointed each and every time . The size options are basically all smalls and some mediums and never any larges. It makes my quick shopping so difficult . I live not even 5 min away from down town Summerlin & I don't see why I have to travel 15 -20'min to the next nearest mall for one or two things just because the downtown Summerlin forever 21 doesn't order in enough bigger sizes . So if your a large in clothes I don't recommend coming to this location !!!!!!!!"
0,"This place is overpriced and I didn't feel safe in the area, especially considering how much I paid for in rent. There are homeless people everywhere and as a single female walking my dog at night I literally had to carry a taser with me. I never had to use it thankfully, but it felt necessary.\nWhen I moved out I had to put down a $500 deposit to reserve the elevator. However the day before I was supposed to move out, the service elevator broke. No one from HOA or leasing contacted me to notify me that I would not have the service elevator and I would have to share the residential elevator. Instead I find out the day of, meanwhile they didn't even have me in their system to move out.  So because of their un-organization and lack of communication it took my movers 5 hours to move my one bedroom apartment when it should have taken 2. I was charged by the hour and ended up paying several hundred dollars more than I should have. I contacted leasing and HOA  and they refuse to reimburse me. This place left a horrible taste in my mouth as they are so unorganized and because of that I  had to bare the burden and pay the price. Don't live here!!"
0,"Best way to put our experience there into words? Bipolar. We went for a prom dress. Poor customer service (other than the consultants who were great, that's why I rate 2 stars, one each for each consultant we worked with, the store itself and other staff get a zero), turning away people 40 min prior to close, guess they don't want to work one minute past 7pm = lost sales/revenue, restocking holds even after calling to say we were coming to get it prior to closing, 5 minute alterations taking over an hour (a brides bustle apparently trumped us, we learned this later, we were willing to pick up the dress another day but were asked to wait). Here's our experience if you care for details...visit one, Saturday morning...we walked in and saw prom/bridesmaid etc. to our left and migrated towards the dresses. Okay, yes, the was a little podium to our right with a woman standing there, but didn't think anything of it (assumption was made, that she is there for women with bridal fitting appointments). She didn't say a word to us. We perused the dresses, pulled some, even asked someone at the sales counter if a certain dress was available in another size somewhere (was told what was out was what they had and that was fine). Still, no one mentioned to us that in order to try on the dresses, we needed a junior consultant working with us (everyone is apparently supposed to check in with the lady at the podium). They had 2 opportunities to assist us with the process and ignored us. Anyway, we go \""sign in\"", the lady at the podium barks over the intercom for a consultant and my daughter is taken to a fitting room. I will say this, the stylist/consultant was very nice and very kind. We put 2 dresses on hold, since this was the first store we visited and headed to some other stores to shop. When it became clear, around 5pm that the dress she wanted was one of the ones at David's, I called to let them know we were coming for it and not to restock it. They said great and we headed back in that direction. When we got there at 5:30, the dress had been restocked. They couldn't find it in the \""on holds area\"" WTH? I didn't complain, just glad it was still THERE, albeit on the regular sales rack. My daughter tried it on again and we noted the hook and eye closure was broken and there was a seem pull on the back as well. Again I will say, the consultant this round was very nice and kind as well, just as much as the first, even helping my daughter find matching shoes etc. and getting the minor alterations done on the spot. Or so we thought. Here's where I need to complain. The alteration lady took the dress to the back, and after about 20 min, we inquired what was taking so long. Our consultant was kind enough to go check for us and came back and said she was currently working on it, We had dinner plans, it was after 6 at this point so we said we could come back for it. The consultant seemed miffed at that and asked us the wait, since the alterations were being done, right then, and the alteration lady was taking the time to do it immediately and putting other things aside for us. We felt bad, and stuck around. BAD idea. At 6:20, still waiting, a prom girl comes in and tries to check in with the podium and is TURNED AWAY, the woman there tells her that since they close at 7pm, she won't have time to try on dresses. WTH again?! There is 40 minutes left to pick and try on dresses! Our visit that morning was only 40 minutes? Lost sale opportunity. We witnessed this again 10 min later, this time with a bride and her bridesmaid seeking bridesmaids dresses. At 6:45, we were done...late for dinner, it had been an hour, when finally, the alterations woman comes out. She was apologetic at least, telling us a bride's bustle had to jump in front of us. Another WTH moment! We were fine picking it up another day but were told she was working on it and asked to wait. A very frustrating moment indeed. Someone should have come and told us that, we would have left and come back. Overall, their consultants, who I'm sure work on commission, were motivated, friendly and helpful. The other staff were horrible! What's also bad for this location is I am a bride and haven't begun my dress search but perused a little while I was there, even mentioned I was a bride, totally went on deaf ears. Another lost sale opportunity. We will never shop here again."
1,Dunkin catfish was my fav but everything was good.
1,"It's been almost two years and too many visits. Just kidding, you can't make too many visits here. Anyway, time for an update!\n\nBachi Burger is a fantastic burger place that I always recommend to friends and family, locals and visitors alike. The specialty burgers are obviously what you want to get, but don't turn a blind eye to appetizers and fries.\n\nI've enjoyed the kurobuta and aribaki sausage w/ honey mustard, chili fried chicken, oxtail chili cheese fries, and the sweet potato fries before. However, my favorite side is definitely the truffle parmesan fries with parmigiano reggiano, white truffle oil (shut up, I know it's not real truffle), porcini cream, and sundried tomato aioli. I don't tend to have it while I'm in the middle of a Bachi burger, so I usually try to get them to bring it out earlier than the burgers.\n\nI will detail all the burgers that I've eaten in reverse power rankings style:\n\n7) \""Banh-mi\"" Burger. Brownie points for the quotation marks. I always enjoy a good banh mi, but I am not a fan of this burger, and it still saddens me that this is the one that they chose to feature on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. The flavors just don't work or harmonize together for some reason, and I always steer people away from this.\n\n6) Mr. Ho's. The highlight is probably lup cheong, a sweet pinkish red pork sausage. The problem is that the overall flavor profile is too sweet and only has that one flavor. Glad I've tried it, glad I'll never have to order it again.\n\n5) Spicy miso. I had this tied with Kiki's before, but I've gotta make a choice. Nothing especially wrong here, and really love the fried egg. Heat seekers, do know that the sauce isn't that spicy, even for someone with a delicate palate like me. If I had a rotation, this would make my rotation.\n\n4) Kiki's. My old second favorite burger. Bacon, lots of mushrooms, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli. Sweet overall but not too sweet, and a good layering of flavors.\n\n3) Miyagi-san's grass-fed wagyu. Relatively simple combination here to accompany the default \""wagyu\"" patty. Chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings. It's really weird though, since I specifically taking a bite, not enjoying it, then flipping my burger upside down and really loving it. I guess the flavors hit my mouth a lot better that way. Try it both ways and see for yourself.\n\nBy the way, I couldn't really distinguish wagyu from the normal angus beef, so you're likely better off not \""upgrading\"" any of your other specialty burgers.\n\n2) Manga. My burger from today. This was a special posted on the chalkboard outside. It is a 7 oz patty with sunny side up egg (presented without top bun not layered), sprouts, crab and scallop dynamite, and a side of pickled ginger. Apparently, enoki mushrooms also were in it, but I don't recall. Anyway, if you're a fan of dynamite, you need to eat this. The egg contributes as usual, the dynamite flavor is all there (most tender baby scallops I've ever had, by the way), the beef flavor is always there, and the pickled ginger can add extra sweetness if you so desire. I couldn't decide whether I enjoy it more with or without ginger.\n\n1) Ronin. Still my favorite, although the manga made a really, really strong case. I think the yuzu citrus aioli adds enough acidity that it pushes the Ronin above a very strong field of contenders. Caramelized onions, Japanese coleslaw, miso goma dressing, and my beloved fried egg complete the flavor combination.\n\nAll burgers really should be enjoyed medium-rare. It's cooked, but you still get that nice pinkish center and keep all the juiciness. If you order it well-done, I will personally hunt you down and even haunt your dreams if I must. They have always delivered the right temperature and never gotten me sick, so don't under or over-order.\n\nSome don't believe that it's the best burger in town. I haven't eaten everywhere in Vegas yet, but this is still my favorite place, even in spite of the recent menu-wide price hike. I will also note that some guy who writes a blog solely about Vegas burgers has apparently been almost everywhere, and he's named Bachi as his favorite. You will have to see for yourself, and I hope you manage to go early or late enough to avoid the ubiquitous crowds."
1,"I haven't been in nearly a year, so I am due.\nThis little S/M gem is hidden on Oakey and if you aren't familiar with the area, can be a bitch to find, get in and get out.\n\nHaving said that...\nWe were immediately impressed by the front office/screening area. They want to make sure you are of proper age and know what this place is.\nIn the office you'll find seating and advertisements for kinky places, shops, and vacations. Pretty awesome, I took a handful.\n\nOnce inside, you'll see a kink store that specializes in their own brand of \""electro-stimulus play\"". Basically you buy the box and wiring. Then buy the accessories. There are more accessories than you can shake a stick at. I mean a whole catalog, and illustrations of how they can each be used. \nMy hubby and I have known of this place, and its wares for years, but are still unable to afford them. To my knowledge they will let you go to the backroom and try somethings out in \""the chair\"".\nSounds ominous.\nI have seem the exhibit at a few fetishballs, and at the time,was too reserved to exhibit in public...even though it was behind closed doors. It was still in front of people.\n\nAnywayyyyy,must return again with lots of $$$.\nWould appreciate a groupon/ some other form of discount greatly. The economy sucks!"
1,Love this place they have great prices and good service!! Seriously undid some of the knots in my shoulder and made me feel relaxed! Next time I might do 90 min I didn't want it to end!
1,"Delightful place. Delightful location. Delightful people. Lizzy and Trevor are colorful, engaging, and attentive - not only in their customer service but in the selection of their shop goods. I walked out with a bag full of goodies and gadgets that I've never seen elsewhere: Big red magic ball, iridescent bubble spinners, and sushi decor for my little man's Kindle.  The Willy Wonka of toys. Something for everyone. This place is a unicorn!"
1,"I missed the Yelp party here! Nooooo!\n\nBeen here a couple of times... it's the Chipotle of Pasta. Easiest, best way to describe it.\n\nSolid lunch spot. Make your own pasta dishes... what else can you say about it? if you love pasta, this is your place. Service with a smile, everything was cooked to order, it's turning into a nice little regular spot for us."
0,Worst zoo I have been to. Not a good zoo if you have a big stroller. There were hills upon hills and it was way more exhausting than fun. There were doors in the kids exhibit that i could barely get my stroller through. \n\nThe playground was awful. Like some tunnels and nets. \n\nSecurity was super nice and helpful though. I had left my headlights on and they notified me :)
0,"Ugh!!! I used to come here every Saturday after Japanese school with my mom. \nI have FOND memories here, but something has happened. Something terrible...... \n\n - The servers don't speak English nor do they speak any other Asian language. \n - I ordered tea and got a green tea bag in my mug... A MUG!! ... GREEN TEA!! \n - The small dish for dipping is a deep black little cup (customary for ketchup or ranch) \n\n\nIf you know Pho.. AUTHENTIC PHO you know those three points are enough for a strike. \n\nThe taste has declined and I was SO incredibly disappointed. \n\nHighly Americanized and the awful parking lot really doesn't make this place worth your time or calories."
0,I have been a client with my kids for 8 years. James O'Neil is a good doctor but when it comes to being in a bind they don't work with you. Billing hung up on me and they cancelled my appointment.
0,went in for liver and herring for the holidays.Also some bagels. It was almost like I was being punked  as everyone ignored me. After painful begging  my friend and I got the holiday stuff we paid and went home. (Ok...no one there is at all friendly. Not helpful. The girl checking me out mumbled so badly we could not understand her. She then said something rude as I did not respond correctly to her mumbles..LOL)\n....got my bagel box home and someone screamed...look at this 13 perfectly uncooked round balls. Slightly brown on the top and you could put your finger through the center.Now in the trash..\nno response to my email to the company. Oh I know I should have returned them but an hour to Shea to be treated rudely was not happening.\nNever will go there again. Zero stars...one to get on but you know it is zero
1,The best experience and the best food ever!!!\nWe were going to go to Cut after a whole day of playing at the craps table but opted to go here after the very nice hostess told us she could seat us right at 530. Mark and Miller were our waiters. Really? Two people to one table? Really! They were very entertaining and very knowledgeable. \n\nWe were so happy with the presentation and the flavor of each dish! I couldn't help taking pictures of our dishes. They were just amazing!
1,"The food was incredible, but the owner was surprised to see our group despite our reservation. Other than his absentmindedness, the experience was fantastic. The server was also very friendly."
0,Service was terrible with only one guy waiting on 3 tables. And the steaks were average at best with a lo tof fat content.The hot plate is a nice touch but can not carry the meal on it's own. Maybe just an off night but definately convinced me to move on with our choice for a steak dinner the next time
1,"I really like the Springs Preserve.  This review would have been 5 stars if the Preserve still had the \""Untold Stories\"" series on the first Thursday of the month.  These programs about the history of Las Vegas were wonderful, but the Preserve decided to re-evaluate their educational offerings.\n\nI love the Origen Building with its movie \""Miracle in the Mojave\"" about water and the lack thereof in the Las Vegas Valley.  It's a brief film, narrated by Martin Sheen, and it quite nicely relates how the area came to be what it is geologically.\n\nThe flash flood in the Origen is also fun to see.  When it's not too hot, I like to go in the back and see the animals in the fenced area or in the display domes.\n\nI need to go back and hike the trails again to see what has changed from when they opened."
1,"Lotus is a breath of fresh air in a sea of over-hyped, over-priced pretentious restaurants here in Las Vegas.\n\nThe ingredients are fresh and appropriate to the style.  Dishes are properly prepared and done quickly given the fact that the restaurant is always crowded.  They will adjust the level of \""heat\"" to your liking to the best of their ability although some dishes have no choice but to be somewhat spicy due to the pre-prepared sauces used in their preparation. \n\nThey also have a remarkable wine list for a restaurant of this genre.  There are several Grand Cru Bordeaux choices with a range of vintages as well as all the usual suspects.  But, it IS Las Vegas :D\n\nYes, you have to plan ahead if you want to eat here.  People begin lining up out front more than half an hour befor opening time so don't be surprised if you're told an hour or longer for a walk-in.  Even though it is located in a decrepit strip mall you otherwise wouldn't give a second glance, everyone knows how good the food is and acts accordingly."
1,"Dinner last night was my first visit here and it totally rocked!  The risotto with shrimp is a \""must have\"" if you're a shrimp or risotto fan.  My friend and I split the dish and they added an extra shrimp so that we would each have the same amount!!!!\nPear salad was great and the spaghetti and meatballs were awesome as well.  My boyfriend had the lentil soup and while I'm not a fan, he raved about it also!"
1,Absolutely amazing! The cost is extremely low especially for the quality!
0,Horrible service... A dinner that should have only been about an hour or so took forever... Servers were very rude... drinks were not maintained... Food took forever... the music was so loud for the dancers and for the in-between time that my husband and I could not even talk to each other...  the live dancers were hmmm so so... and being from Dearborn MI ( the 2nd largest middle eastern community in the world other than the middle east) I think I know Arabic or middle eastern food... the food is nothing to write home about... save your self the time and belly ache and go to haji baba in Tempe  on main... http://www.yelp.com/biz/haji-baba-tempe this place knows Arabic.. In fact the cook is from Michigan
1,"I won't hesitate to call Casa Reynoso the best Mexican Food in Arizona. My orders are always delicious and I am a long-time customer. My favorite dishes are their tacos, bean burritos and green chile. As far as sides go, the rice and beans are outstanding.\n\nAlong with their excellent food, their service is top notch. If you enjoy Mexican food, you need to give this place a try!\n\nP.S. Don't forget to order a cheese crisp!"
1,"My Favorite part about Costa Vida is that when I finish my meal, I don't feel weighed down like one typically feels after eating Mexican Food.  It is not only Fresh, but CLEAN.  Thank You Costa Vida for keeping your cooking process Clean and ingredients Fresh.  We can tell a difference.  Great Flavors.   My only critique would be the long lines."
1,"This is place is PHENOMENAL!!! Everyone here is so wonderful and so willing to help with anything.  I just moved in recently however one of the reasons I moved in was because how great of a feeling I had each time I had an encounter with the staff at the front office.  Their energy is amazing!!! Danielle is the one that  initially helped me the first time I came in and she is the greatest EVER and such a sweetie but I have to say, Matt is the BOMB too he also helped me out when I was being a CRAZY lady and had to know some more about the apartment before I moved in haha. :) Karly and Laci are also AMAZING with all there great energy and \""I can help you with anything\"" attitude!  Let me just finish off with the maintenance crew, WOW Im speechless with these guys.  Bernardo, Craig and James are all fantastic and are always ready to go above and beyond for us here. Anytime I need a helping hand or am being crazy haha ;) and need something fixed there right there when I call.  I had some issues upon move in as sometimes that's to be expected took some time to get them fixed, BUT they were resolved and now everything has been absolutely PERFECT!  I have to commend the Domain for having such a wonderful and great staff, because without them it wouldn't be the same, THANK YOU ALL!  :)"
1,"Since I live in the east Valley and work in Central Phoenix, I need a few good watering holes to kill time while the traffic clears. Rosie's is one of those places that has a local watering hole feel. Plus they have good beer, good happy stuff and everyone in there from the bartenders to the people are cool."
1,"Vinnie's Deluxe on wheat for a 2pm lunch on Tuesday, and my next meal was breakfast on Wednesday.  Basically, my $10 sandwich took care of lunch and dinner for me - what a deal!\n\nNot only did the pastrami, brisket, and turkey go well together, but I also ate pieces of the meat by themselves, and they were all great.  The sandwich was probably small by NY deli standards, but it was big for only 10 bucks!  \n\nI would go back there, but will make sure I share my sandwich with someone or take half to go.  A lot of food places in NYNY are overpriced, but Greenberg's is a great value."
1,"Elite Dental is hands down the best dentist office I've ever gone to!  Dr. Trinh is fantastic and the staff is phenomenal.  When you speak to the ladies over the phone, their friendliness and professionalism shines through.  When you go in for a visit that same friendliness and professionalism is always how they will greet and treat you.  They make sure they advise you upfront on the costs and expectations of any work you may need.  Jennifer and Rachelle are awesome and the office ambience is very cozy and comfortable, it isn't sterile or medicinal.  \nDr. Trinh is gentle with his care always has a smile and a pleasant demeanor.  I have no anxiety going into the office for any type of appointment.  \nThe team at Elite Dental is awesome!"
1,"By far the best rendition of NY Style pizza in Charlotte.  This was our first visit and we will definitely be back. Although we live closer to the Ballantyne we will go there next week. \n\nWe just had a pizza with bacon and it was perfect.  They use good cheese,  an excellent sauce and perfectly crumbled bacon. \n\nGood atmosphere for kids too n"
1,"When it first surfaced here in Las Vegas, burger places were mostly relegated to cheap fast food.  In that era, Smashburger stood out for its quality, taste, and a bit of variety for burgers and burger-a-likes.\n\nFlash forward to 2014.  There are great burgers on every corner (well, almost). That being said, the Sin City is still a great burger, no need to go with the heavier burger, it is quite satisfying with cheese, bacon, onion haystacks, & a fried egg.\n\nAs much as everyone seems to like the Smash Fries (crispy shoestring fries tossed in olive oil with garlic, rosemary, and salt), I prefer the Sweet Potato Fries.  Classic thin fry cut, lightly battered/breaded, for crispness, & mildly sweet.\n\nI am glad that there are great burgers out there, but this is one of the places that helped raise the bar in the first place.\n\nEnjoy, but there are PLENTY of great burger & fry joints out there."
0,"Yea it's bland crust and a few toppings.\n\nThe hype for this place is ridiculous. \n\nIt is NOTHING special at all, and it is not worth the high price."
1,"Thank you YELP posters that rated this \""hole on the wall\"" restaurant, like so many other \""hole in the wall\"" favorites, this is a sure winner. He even spotted that I had never been here before and offered me samples of the different spicy beef and chicken. I strongly recommend the chicken for its abundant flavor without being \""hot\"". The beef had a nice kick to it with two flavorful versions. I had a chicken burrito as well as one of the spicy beef burritos. \nDon't be fooled by the location, go in and try the great food. I am also a fan of the real sugar soft drinks from Mexico, the strawberry was a perfect compliment to the rich Mexican style food. The condiment bar is well stocked with a variety of great flavors to enhance your dining pleasure.\nI think I have to go now, my wheelbarrow just arrived to get me back to my vehicle. \nOverall you will not be disappointed!! Happy feasting!!"
0,"Since our last visit, the quality has gone a bit downhill. There is still plenty there that is tasty, but there was some rib concoction that was really meatloaf and all the pork was overcooked.\n\nAlso, the server we had was the worst in Vegas. We had to ask three times for a cup of coffee to start and we we asked for milk for some cereal, our server said okay and we never saw her again. Our server was a zero!\n\nI'm not sure if we will be back. We were disappointed."
0,"pretentious, stuffy and more geared toward retail than the practice of yoga. Went once, will never go again"
1,"My first visit to \""The Parlor\"".  Stopped in for a late lunch yesterday and snagged a table outside on the patio.  We both ordered the spinach salad.  It was loaded with bacon, tomatoes, white cheese, avocado and garnished with a sliced hard boiled egg.  Added roasted chicken which made it a meal in itself.  Our beer was served ice cold and that's good because that is how I like my beer.  Bottom line, this place is great.  I can't wait to return for another salad and to sample something new. \n\nPrice point is a bit high but you get what you pay for:\n$27 for two wonderful salads (yum)\n$6 for adding roasted chicken\n$5 Guinness\n$4 Sierra Nevada Pale Ale\nTotal lunch $45"
1,"A friend suggested this place for dinner last night.  I haven't posted a review in a while and thought this was definitely my opportunity so why not!  I'm a huge believer in the Downtown revitalization and support new and existing businesses.  This place is fairly new and has had some good reviews, so I was excited.\n\nWhen you walk in you notice the clean \""D Grill\"" logo, which I liked.  Turn the corner inside and you'll see a huge focal point: Charlie Brown zigzag pattern lining the walls, accompanied with forks and spoons lining the actual pattern. There's a black and orange color scheme. The colors on the ground are black, white and tan brown. The middle booths have high backs to break up the room.  The tables are a 50's themed brown and metal.  To me, it's a modern twist to a diner-grill.  Pretty cool, liked it a lot.  Our server, Susana, was really nice and accommodating.  I told her up front that we wanted our checks split at the end and she was more than willing to do so!  \n\nFor dinner, I got the Macadamia Nut Crusted Halibut for $18.95.  At first, I thought it was a little steep in price for a downtown grill, however, I was willing to try it out.  It came with a basket of rolls.  They reminded me of a less dense version of a garlic knot.  The flavor was good, however, the roll itself seemed a little old and stale.  With my dinner, I had the choice of soup of salad.  I chose the side salad with balsamic vinaigrette on the side.  The salad was just iceberg and spring mix with one wedge of tomato. The balsamic vinaigrette didn't seem fresh, just your ordinary manufactured dressing.  Then came the main course.  Btw, it came super fast so I was happy about that.  At first, I was a little turned off by the plate presentation.  Very ordinary and didn't seem like a $20 plate.  Looks are definitely deceiving.  This place came with halibut, rice and veggies. The veggies were mixed veggies (broccoli and carrots).  They were steamed and then saut\u00e9ed with garlic and butter.  In the middle of the plate was a scoop of white rice with a chive garnish.  Then there's the fish accompanied with an orange ginger sauce.  The veggies were cooked very nicely and really complimented the dish.  Wasn't too much of a fan of the rice.  I preferred more of a stickier white rice, this one was a little dry.  The fish was definitely the star of the show.  Perfectly cooked, lightly crusted and delicious.  The orange ginger sauce really took the fish to a whole new level.  I was impressed.  \n\nAll in all, I really liked my first visit here.  Definitely worth going back.  I'm excited to try other things like the burger or other salads.  If you're on Fremont, come check them out!  It's a great surprise :)"
1,"Great place to just hang out. Friendly service and good food. One of my favorites is the BLT&E. Lots of flavor, not heavy, and just the right amount of \""different\"""
1,"Ever since I was a little kid, I have always had a special place in my heart for things with history.  I love getting lost in a sweet little antique store and finding hidden gems, that's why I love Qcumberz so much!!  They truly have a great selection of furniture, books, music, lighting fixtures, etc.  And what's great about them is that they aren't overpriced.  I always find things there that are fairly priced.  Some places around town have great wares, but want millions for them.  \n\nThe last time I was in, the owner (I'm guessing) came over and asked what items/what era I was looking for.  Super nice guy, very friendly without being up in my business the whole time.  Informed me they had layaway available and then let me do my perusing in peace.  \n\nHighly recommend this spot!"
0,"I know it's Burger king but still.  All I ask is that my food be hot. If not hot, at least warm.\n\nAirport food is expensive and I realize that. \n\nDon't eat here unless you like cold food and self service coffee that is warm."
0,"I've never really hit up the Ramen scene yet, even though it seems to be taking over everywhere.  This place was brand new to town, Sakanaya has been around a while, but decided to give this place a try at a friend's request.\n\nFirst of all, having no exposure to the ramen scene, I expected to walk in and find prices for food to be 4 or 5 dollars for a bowl of ramen.  After all, you can get a cup ramen for 25 cents, so a reasonable upcharge on upscaling a cheap food item, I was thinking 4 or 5 dollars.  So as you can imagine, walking in and seeing prices in excess of $12 or $13 dollars sort of took me by surprise.  I almost decided to leave right there seeing as dinner for two was going to set me back 30 dollars with tip, and 30 dollars for ramen?  Chipotle or Five Guys would be a better investment, value to deliciousness ratio.\n\nStill, this being my first exposure to ramen, I guess it was educating to find out that everyone is upcharging this much.  I don't know what the possible overhead could be on some of these items.  A simple bowl of ramen in excess of 10 dollars... there had better be a side of cucumber salad, a 6 piece California maki, and some green tea included or something, alas no... it was just the ramen.\n\nSo on the merits of value, this places gets a 3/10.  I don't feel as ripped off as when I go to a tapas place, or go to GT Fish and Oyster in Chicago (where I feel as though they take my money, my clothes, my dignity, and my self respect, and in return, they give me two oysters that taste like freezer burn thawed dressed up snot balls).  But if this is to be a regular joint for me to visit, value's gotta be upwards of a 7 or 8 out of 10 value.  And in today's economy, I'd argue it's that simple.  Keep it affordable, and I'll continue to come around.  \n\nMy wife got the kalbi ramen, good choice.  I decided to make myself feel less ripped off and went for something simple, chicken teriyaki, to see how this place would spin a beloved classic.  \n\nMy wife's ramen was actually pretty dang good.  Some insider information has informed me that the cooks have been doing it for 3+ decades, and know what they are doing.  Ramen noodles are of the highest quality, and the broth is not overly seasoned needlessly.  \n\nWhat surprised me the most was the quality of the kalbi she had.  It wasn't garbage meat that you pick up in the \""unknown meat\"" section of the super market, but it was a high quality melt in your mouth giant piece of kalbi.  Really good.  The additional fixings in her ramen were less than remarkable.  Where I praise the quality of the kalbi, and the ramen noodles themselves, the broth though it tasted good, was extremely greasy.  A flash refrigeration cycle to get the fat solidified on top, then skimmed, and reboiled wouldn't hurt in their food prep procedures.\n\nAfter only a few spoonfuls of the broth, I felt like my face was oozing garlic and someone had put sesame oil on their hands, and rubbed it all over my face.  So, probably some of the prep process can be improved over all there.  A fat skimming refrigeration of the broth would go a long way.\n\nThe chicken teriyaki I got was unremarkable.  Surprised since it cost I think $8 or $9.  I was expecting a sizable portion and a bunch of fixings to balance out the chicken, but no, just salad, rice, and the chicken.  Even after adding in overhead and paying people, justifying $8 or $9 for that is pretty unheard of.  From a taste perspective, it was just standard.  I'd go as far as to say it lacked inspiration or imagination, and more enjoyment could have been realized from baking plain chicken at home, and pouring store bought teriyaki sauce on it. Perhaps a bit harsh there.\n\nOn the merits of taste in general, the place gets a 6/10.  The savior was the ramen (as expected).\n\nFrom a service perspective, the people were great, polite.  I did feel as though once I had paid, I was dead to the hostess, and any further dealings with me would be a waste of her time.  For being someone who has no idea about the ramen scene, I was expecting her to tell me what to do, or what to expect, where I can get my food, or who will be delivering it to my table, etc. So I picked up some napkins, and some plastic utensils, not having any idea what to expect.\n\nAll of a sudden the cook yelled out a number.  Having no idea what was going on, I sought the receipt that I had crumpled up into my pocket, only to realize that I'm supposed to get my own food.  That's totally fine of course, except for the fact that no one told me how anything worked.  So for 30 seconds, the cook continued to yell out a number and got increasingly upset. My bad, I didn't know!  Merits of service.  3/10.\n\nFinal thoughts.  Cost doesn't justify volume of food, and just \""ok\"" taste.  Probably a once every 4 years restaurant for me.  Sakanaya will probably be no better.  We'll see."
0,Very disappointing experience.  \n-Moved through ER in a timely fashion.\n-Ran the same scan/test that I had an hour earlier at a radiology center.  I even provided them a disc with the results.\n-The staff over promised and under delivered many times.\n-The doctor didn't even review the scan/test results before seeing me.\n-The doctor royally screwed up the prescriptions and didn't call them into the pharmacy as promised.\nBottom line:   I wouldn't return to this location!
1,Went there for first time after looking at all the wonderful reviews on Yelp and I wasn't disappointed.  Food was phenominal!!  Service was excellent!!  I will definitely be back here in the future.
0,"I've tried this place 3 times now, and well, it just doesn't live up to its hype.   It is trendy, clean, decorated nicely, located strategically, and the service is good.   But for me, the food is just \""eh ok\"", the special martinis are just \""eh ok\"", and its pricey."
0,Awww. Was so good when I was here before. Went for nice dinner. Was disappointed. Best things were the entrees. Got the pork shoulder. Good. All friti and vegetable things that were so good before but lost it now. Sugar settled in the wine. Bottle shouldn't have been served. Would recommend skipping.
0,"looks like everyone else beat me to it. customer service at this location was horrendous. i've never had an issue with budget until this location. the guy at the drop of site must have had a bad day. spitting attitude and dirty looks (wtf?). he also charged me per mile on accident, so i had to go to the service desk upstairs (which he was no help in directing us to where that was). low and behold, the line is out the door. thanks, but no thanks. vegas budget, get your act together."
0,"I've taken my 3 poms here for almost 2 years and they change the price all the time without telling me. I asked Pam \""why is the bath and brush $40 now when it was $25 in the beginning\"" we went over the extras that they were charging me for that I wasn't aware of and I told her I want the basic bath and brush no extras from now on. The cost was $29 the next two times, which was ok because they had a price increase and on the third visit it was $41! I had brought $40 in cash with me since they charge 5% more if you write a check or pay with debit so you can imagine my surprise when she said I didn't give her enough. Here I had planned on giving the groomer an $11 tip and then had this sprung on me ONCE again! I was less than pleased and reminded her of our past conversation about the ever fluctuating prices and how it was unacceptable. Since there was another customer there she wanted to hush me up quickly and honored the correct price but I'm sure it was only to not embarrass the shop. Too bad they are super close to my house and did an ok job but WOW what poor business practices! Needless to say we won't be going back and we've already found a great groomer that doesn't price gouge."
0,"My friend and I came here for happy hour/light early dinner while staying at the resort. I had specifically asked for a saltless margarita, and I received one with salt. I ignored this and carried on. We each ordered a prawn skewer and a bowl of albondigas. When we received the soup, it ways way beyond salty. \n\nWe managed to notify the waiter who said that he would be right with us. Ten minutes later, he responded to us and we asked for the other soup instead. Another 10 minutes pass and he was VERY attentive to everyone else in the restaurant but us. Mind you, this was not a very busy restaurant and there were only 3 other tables with customers. \n\nHe ended up bringing us a cup to sample and our shrimp. The shrimp was very good and we ate that, but he was very slow in attending to us. My friend and I, tired of waiting, decided to add up our own bill and left money as the service was abysmally slow given that this was NOT a bustling restaurant. We noted that the prices were overly high for such bad service and then we went to Auld Dubliner, where we were also disappointed. We are usually good customers who do not usually complain unless the service and/or food suck. Do not patronize this restaurant as it leaves a lot to be desired."
1,"We stopped in on Monday afternoon 6/16 during the USA soccer game. At the bar in the casino just off the gift shop, not the main restaurant bar.  It was a lot of fun.  Our bar tenders were Billy, Kevin and I believe after Kevin left it was Josh.  Most of our interactions were with Billy.  He was originally from a town that is fairly close to where we live.  Which are both suburbs of Chicago.   It gave us a nice place to start our conversation about favorite foods and things to do.   From there it just went on.  They were a lot of fun.  Had some great bar Flare.  Billy was balancing bottles on the bridge of his nose and serving them, along with bottle flare, noise makers and loud appreciation of nice tips.  We enjoyed ourselves, had too many drinks and watched Team USA win the soccer game.  Great time."
0,"I was hesitant to get a cleaning service, but decided to try it. After Molly Maids service I know why I have been so hesitant. \n\nThey were about 2 hours late to clean my house and when I walked outside the team was shopping at the yard sale, while I am waiting. \n\nThey were there for 2 hours before I came home and when I came home I was not impressed with the level of cleaning and they still did not even get to all the rooms (only a 3 bdr 2 bath house) or touched the floors. I asked about the coffee table and dusting, which they claimed to do and one would think they did until you looked closely and moved a coaster.  \n\nOn top of everything they broke a custom made chandelier that my husband made and did not find this to be a big deal. \n\nI really like to be able to give a good review, but I have to be honest that the service was very disappointing."
1,"Good but expensive.  But I guess all hotel cafes/restaurants are expensive.  Can get crowded and with long lines.\n\nOpens at 6am, which was perfect for LV because we didn't get back from the late night club til 545 am, so before heading back up to our room, we waited 15 minutes for the cafe to open and had breakfast!  ONLY IN VEGAS! LOL"
0,"Not impressed.  Went for lunch with a group.  No one really bragged about their meal, especially me.  I told the waiter what I was debating between and he suggested the brisket saying it is good and \""very filling\"".  I ordered the brisket.  It came out about 5 minutes after the rest of my table was served and the piece I was served was well over half pure fat.  Due to the fact that half was inedible to me I was hungry again within 3 hours.  If I am ever in Charlotte again I will find another place to eat."
1,"came here for a light lunch yesterday with a friend and her son. this review will be about their food and not their beer seeing as how i am not a beer drinker (although i hear it is amazing if that is what you are looking for.) we were seated right away around 2pm. our waitress was super friendly and helpful with the menu and pointing out their lunch specials they had on the last page of their menu. she also was good at entertaining my friends two year old son. that was a relief! we decided to share some snack size guacamole. it was pretty good. it also had feta cheese on it which scared me at first. i have never had feta cheese on guac and never would have thought to put it on, but it turned out to be delious! we also got a snack size of the truffle fries which were addicting. i could have ate the whole bowl by myself. for the main course we shared some margarita pizza. it was pretty good. tasted a little salty, but not an overload. still good and had me eating more.\ni never would have expected yardhouse to have pretty decent food but i was impressed. i think i will be back to try a few drinks and some more snack size bites that won't be breaking my bank."
1,"We ordered out for delievery from them for the first time this past week. Now, a lot of places here have Gryo's but not this good. I haven't had a Gryo this good in 15 plus years. The fries were actually pretty good too especially for delievery fries. This is our new go-to place for Gryo's."
0,"I was there for dinner on a Thursday night. This was the blandest, most boring food I've had in Las Vegas. Seriously, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. And the line and the grill station was ridiculous. It should have been a sign to the management that they needed to add another line for the food, or increase the staffing. We're talking about food that is already cooked and portioned, so there should be very little time spent getting it. But it was the only part of the place with any line, other than the line to get in. I ended up giving into hunger and went to the pasta line instead and had pasta primavera. But it was terrible. it was oily and flavorless. It had literally four pieces of vegetables in it. And I saw him prepare it for me. Yet by the time I got back to the table it was already cold. How is this possible? Cold plate, very briefly cooked food. \n\nThere was no sour cream at the potato station. Ask for it and someone will carry a blob of it on a spoon from the kitchen. The salad bar requires you to ask someone to scoop the ingredients onto a small plate. The result is unappetizing. All the ingredient bins were picked over and the quantities given were miniscule. The resulting salad was terrible. And they were not very friendly. And no, I was not complaining or being difficult. They were just flat and unresponsive people.\n\nOn the upside, I did not get food poisoning, which is the only reason it gets two stars and not one. I recommend going the food courts over this dreck.\n\nThe one positive thing I have to say about the experience is that our server was friendly and pleasant. But everyone else was misery.\n\nWhomever runs this place should be replaced immediately. They do not know how to run a pleasant place."
1,"Darden employees have done it once again! They never fail me in showing excellent service with their customer loyalty that Darden dearly values. The customer and employee relationship that starts, as soon as you are seated, is absolutely phenomenal! This Yardhouse at the LINQ is a must visit! The unique parts of this restaurant are the floating kegs on the second floor, Most but not all employees in here is your friend and EAGER to make your first and every experience the best you've ever had. I never feel hesitant to speak to an employee for specific concerns or needs in food on the menu. Whether it is having an allergy to an ingredient or just simply not liking a particular part of the food you want to order. These employees are very willing to make you a happy customer by always going out of their way to accommodate you!  One advice I can leave you with is, be patient with this location for another year because they are fairly new, if some employees don't give superb customer service, the right information, or don't know every question, you could let a restaurant manager know to train them better. Communication is what makes the world go round! It solves many issues or concerns. I would love mention specific employees who give BEYOND excellent service each time, Martin, Jason, Ryan, and Sky."
0,"I was actually really disappointed. I grew up going to D&B in Texas when I'd visit my family there and absolutely loved the place, but the locale at Tempe Marketplace would kind of a let down. I definitely wouldn't grade their food an A, it was decent but I mean it's 'playground' for kids and big kids alike I suppose, so you're not necessarily going for the food.\n\nBut the cleanliness was horrible. I walked into the womans bathroom and almost every stall was clogged/or cluttered as if it had been TP'd by a bunch of children.\n\nOur waiter was a great help and super nice, but when I approached someone on the management staff in regards to the untidy bathroom the mans response was, \""Don't worry about it we have someone on it\"" . I was seriously a bit taken back at his response and it rubbed me the wrong way. Don't think I'll be making another trip back, anytime soon."
1,"Just went to Duke's over my lunch break from work to have my back drivers side tire patched. I work on the South side and try to take care of as many of this type of problem as possible over my lunch break. That being the case, I couldn't be more happy with their service. No appointment necessary and my tire was patched in less than 10 minutes, plus it only cost $15. I'm going to go here for all of my tire services in the future! For what it's worth, I have a 2012 Mazda 3.\n\nGreat service and took no time at all!!"
1,"I truly enjoy every visit to Pita Jungle. I get excited knowing it'll be exceptionally good, and good for me. The hummus with grilled chicken is enough for two people. Skip the regular, boring hummus and go with half roasted bell pepper, half cilantro jalapeno for a winning combination under $10 bucks. Throw in an extra pita and you've got a full lunch or dinner packed with mouth watering flavor and tons of protein for all you diet/fitness fans. \n\nIt's been months since I've strayed from my beloved hummus, but I can't fail to mention noteworthy selections on the menu. The roasted chicken shawarma pita is your standard gyro. Tender meat and fresh veggies. *Ask for extra tzatziki sauce*\n\nFancy stepping out of your carnivorous comfort zone? The Chipotle Black Bean Burger will satisfy your need for spices (not heat), and double down on an intricate blend of healthy ingredients. Homemade black beans are the building blocks of the patty, tossed with onions, garlic, bell peppers, oats, cranberries, you get the picture! Served up with chipotle hummus and potatoes. My recommendation for nervous new vegetarians who can't fathom giving up the beef."
0,"I purchased a phone here 2 years ago and did not agree to go under a new contract in any way shape or form.  Now TMobile \""loyalty department\"" is telling me that I signed a new contract.\n\nThe funny part is, they do not have a copy of the contract.  They are just saying that since some sales representative at this location put a \""memo\"" in my account, that is legally binding.  They cannot provide me with a copy of any contract at all, but somehow feel they are allowed to hold me to it.  They are telling me that I was given a copy and I should have kept it since they do not.\n\nThis does not make any sense at all.\n\n\""If you do not have a contract there showing that I signed and agreed to it, how can you hold me to it?\""\n\""I understand, I'm on your side, that's why I just want to let you know we will just keep your lines open for the length of the contract to save you from paying a cancellation fee.\""\n\""I never signed a contract.

I did not used to feel this way, but after having a 30 minute conversation with them about this I have changed my mind.  I was not cancelling my entire service with them even, just 2 of my 4 phone lines.  This would only have saved me about $10 per month.  \n\nTMobile chose to harrass me and make up a contract that I never signed in order to keep me from saving this meager amount of money.  They do not seem to care that in doing this they lost a lifelong customer, in order to hopefully choke an extra $60 out of me over the course of the next 6 months that they claim I am under contract for.\n\nStay away!"
1,A MUST VISIT. I was visiting from out of town and my brother and I were on a food/pub crawl. This was my second lunch of the day and I had the hot corn beef samich with fries. A very good samich and the atmosphere was great with the college football games going on and watching people plunk down for the pony and dog races. Lots of TV's and big patio which was covered up so they could run the ac outside. I will be back and my brother said this place takes over the whole parking lot for St. Pats day with bands and other live-ations we Irish do.
0,"My partner and I wanted to escape the cold and vacation at a resort in the Scottsdale area to celebrate his 40th birthday. I was initially attracted to the Montelucia since it was a five-star rated resort and had received several great reviews on the websites. I suspect that some of these reviews are self-generated- although I have no evidence to prove this. When I think of a five-star resort, I imagine impeccable customer service. That means a staff that anticipates your needs. The only thing the staff at the Montelucia anticipated was a tip. \nThe Intercontinental chain is owned and operated by the same conglomerate that operates Holiday Inn. It certainly showed. \nThe problems started when I asked for a one-night romance package followed by two more days of just the room. I was informed that I would have to check-out and then check back in after the first night. Why? Because that's how their system is set up. Does this sound like they put their customers first?\nWe stayed in a \""deluxe\"" room with a view of Camelback mountain with a \""private\"" patio.  The room faced Camelback mountain obscured by a stucco fence and greenery so you only see the tip of the mountain peeking over the top. As far as a private patio goes, the patio is simply made of a few bricks with two five-foot stucco walls jutting out on either side. You can easily see and be seen by your neighbors and the grounds crew who seemed to be working non-stop outside trimming the greenery and running a leaf blower at the crack of dawn, thanks a lot.\nUpon arrival we were greeted by the valets and bellhops who unloaded our luggage and said they would deliver them to our room. I tipped the eager bellhop immediately. After checking in I happened to pass the circle drive out front and there were our two bags left unattended leaning against a garbage can. I asked another bellhop and he immediately drove us and our luggage to the room where I tipped again. \nThe room was okay. Nothing spectacular. The faucet in the shower was difficult to turn and the cleanliness was questionable. \nLater that afternoon we were given a birthday surprise. A chocolate bag of caramel corn and chocolate-covered strawberries arrived with a note for my partner. (His name was misspelled). That was a nice gesture and the delivery person, of course, lingered for a tip. Later that evening another was delivered. I guess the paperwork got mixed up. Anyways the person delivering could easily see the other chocolate bag sitting on the table and yet still left another one. Common sense?\nThe next morning housekeeping knocked at our door despite the privacy please sign on the door. She did not replace the coffee capsules and so the next morning there was no coffee to be had. On our last day, she showed up again even though we were scheduled to check out that day.\nThe pools are nice. Don't sit in the comfy white \""cabana chairs\"" they have to be reserved even though I never saw a single person laying out on one of these the entire time we were there. There is no one serving the adult pool. Instead they have a number to call and they'll send someone in thirty minutes or so. Don't bother. I ordered two Turkey & Sevens. - $28.00 + tip = $32.00\nWhen I asked for an itemized list of charges a few hours before checkout I noticed a charge for a kit-kat bar- ($10.00) We never touched our refreshment center in the room. While packing up to gladly leave, the front desk sent over a worker to inspect. He opened the door to the refreshment center, reached in and moved the kit-kat bar six inches to the right. \nThis is why we incurred a $10 charge?\nThe resort is beautiful, but it's beautiful because it's in Scottsdale. The resort is very corporate with little-to-no appeal.\nWe are kicking ourselves that we didn't stay at the Royal Palms again. That was a resort that got it right. \n(one last thing)\nThe Montelucia charges a $24 charge per day for use of the wireless, pools and health center. One would think if you were a \""guest\"" of the resort then these amenities would be considered standard. Not at the good 'ol Montelucia. \nMany areas/bars/seating areas were closed for private functions and most of the guests were there for business functions. These guests were treated far more diligently then the simple vacationing couple.\nWe will come back to Scottsdale many more times. None of those return visits will be at the Montelucia. \nI know a lot of this seems like I'm complaining about cost. I believe in value. If the experience is impeccable and the staff is attentive, then I have no issue paying a bit more. Value doesn't mean cheap. It means that there is merit to the service. That's just not the Montelucia."
1,"My girlfriend and I brought the kids in Saturday night for some food and to watch the Sun Devil Football game. How stoked was I when the Bartender Brian gave us a great Booth and put the Sun Devils game on right in front of me and then gave me the Dbacks game right next to it on another TV ...Awesome start to the night.... \n\nAfter placing our food order the Bartender took the kids over to a TV that had X-box on it and it kept the kids occupied ... For appetizers we had sliders which were delicious and for dinner we had the Original Burger and the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich which we totally enjoyed w/ Mac and Cheese which I suggest as a side ...... We had a great night and will definitely come back-- the service was great ( Thanks Brian!) we enjoyed the food, the kids had an awesome time and the Sun Devils WIN !"
1,"Love this concept! They were offering complimentary mimosas and beignets on Mother's Day. I had the brioche french toast.  Definitely looked better than it tasted. Was ok, but the presentation is beautiful!Also had the Salted Carmel latte....amazing!  And they carry both almond and soy milk! I don't eat meat, but my dad had their \""eggs Benedict\"" looked amazing, and said it was delish. I have 2 issues with this place.....Their side of \""hlk potatoes\"" has bacon bits in it. It's not posted on their menu and I don't eat meat. Their menu had plenty of \""v\"" options for vegetarian, so obviously they are catering to vegetarians.      My other issue is the server had very little knowledge on the food.  I asked a few questions and she had no clue. She was more than happy to find out, but she hadn't tried a lot of the dishes. I am looking fwd to going back and trying other options :)"
0,"My friends and I had intended to go to Shadygrove downstairs for their half priced wine special and for dinner, but it was pretty crowded this evening.  They initially said the wait was 20-30 minutes so we decided to wait, but while we were waiting the staff kept trying to talk us in to going to the restaurant upstairs called \""Up\"" which originally I had thought was part of the same restaurant and that \""Up\"" was more of a directional sign than an indication of a separate restaurant.  Once it was explained that it had another fancier menu we took a look, but it looked a bit overpriced and fancy for the casual dinner we were looking for.  And it was concerning that downstairs was packed while upstairs was empty, despite their pleas for people to go up there.  The staff were persistent in trying to talk us into it.  Finally I said, well how about you bring some appetizer samples and that might entice us.  The owner actually agreed to this and after about 15 minutes he came down with some ratatouille on mini toasts that was much like a bruschetta.  It was decent, but all it consisted of was some marinated vegetables on toast.  I tried to find the item on the menu and it was not there.  I eventually figured out it was part of a portabella/mozzarella/ratatouille appetizer but they left out the portabella and mozzarella and only gave us the cheaper ratatouille.  I found this to be rather tacky, especially since I intended to try it to figure out if I really wanted to go to the restaurant or not, but this was not a representative appetizer.  \n\nWe still wanted to go to Shady Grove but it turned out the wait was actually going to be much longer than originally estimated.  As a result, we finally gave in and went to \""Up\"" upstairs.  We ordered a $32 of Malbec red wine at half off, which was a good deal for half off though $32 was overpriced for that particular wine (and this was one of the cheaper priced ones).  In fact, the menu listed it as a \""2010\"" vintage but they brought us a \""2011\"" and they spilled some on the tablecloth and menu while pouring.  I ordered the Bolognese pasta for dinner for $24 and it tasted just ok and was a decent portion, but the quality was certainly not worth $24.  There was a decent amount of meat but the pasta texture was off (a little chewy/undercooked) and while the sauce was ok it tasted like it came form a can/jar rather than homemade.  It also wasn't a traditional italian Bolognese (meatballs instead of a meat sauce and an unusual choice for the pasta type, not sure of the name for it), though it didn't claim to be the traditional version.  And no offering of Parmesan cheese to top it off.  I've had much better pasta at Olive Garden for cheaper.  Although it was kind of an interesting variant on the traditional Bolognese.  Also, for $24 you might expect some salad, soup or bread included with your entree, but there was nothing but a very thin and small slightly burnt toast crisp on the plate.  One of my friends had a burger for around $12 which he said was good, but the fries were cold and soggy.  Another friend had a \""small plate\"" of crab tacos also around $12 but it came with 3 of the tiniest tacos I had ever seen (barely bitesize) though she said they tasted good. The presentation of the food was nice and probably their best feature.  Service was fine but nothing stood out. The owner did check up on us once but he seemed bored with so many empty tables.  The decor/ambiance has an odd blend of casual features with a fancier atmosphere and the music choice didn't fit well with the ambiance."
1,"Love this place! I have to say that I find myself driving out of my way for it. I am a huge fan of the spicy, the limu, and the furikake.\n\nThey are incredibly kind and offer free samples too!\n\nWhat I really hate about this place is that it closes so early! BUT.. for some of you who cannot make it by closing... you can call ahead... and they will have it waiting for you on the restaurant side."
1,"This mall has everything that is too expensive for a typical person to buy. If you have money, you shop here. I did feel a little intimidated by some fellow shoppers. I did have an excellent makeup experience at Sephora."
1,"Sushi Samba has been a hit or miss with yelpers, and here's my chance to check them out!  Featuring a special \""Election Day Menu\"" with specialty cocktails and cheap appetizers, it was a perfect opportunity!\n\nDrinks on the menu:\n* Obamarama (blue) for $11 \""Svedka Citron, blue curacao apple liqueur, guava, blueberry\"" - Really good the first time around. Pleasant to look at and just tasty-good.  The guys and gals enjoyed this drink.  The second time I ordered it, there was way too much alcohol though, and not in a good way.  A good cocktail should be enjoyable to drink; I passed the second one off.\n\n* Maverick (red) for $11 \""Pearl Vodka, freshly muddled strawberries, orange liqueur, lime, guava\"" - Served in a martini glass, so a bit more delicate to drink.  Pretty tasty as well. I enjoyed it.\n\nBites to eat:\n* Shishito Peppers ($2) \""grilled spicy peppers, sea salt and lemon\"" - They give you a bunch of these peppers on a plate, and it was okay for me.  I tried one and found that to be good enough.  Didn't really care for more.\n\n* Organic Chicken Aji Amarillo Anticucho ($2) - I found the chicken to be okay, but really enjoyed the Peruvian corn that came with the dish.  That was the best part of it.  Our order had one skewer of chicken, but the party next to us had two? Hmm... \n\n* Spicy Crunchy Tuna Roll ($3) - Really good roll!  I liked this a lot and ordered myself another.  I like how they do their spicy sauce here; it's more mayonnaise-based.  And the slight crunch is nice too.\n\n* Salmon Avocado Roll ($3) - Pretty simple roll with just salmon and avocado.  But it was fresh fish and good.  I'm sad I didn't order more.\n\n* Mini Chicharron de Calamar ($3) \""cornmeal crusted calamari with tamarind sauce, tomato salsa & plantain\"" - Our friend's order came out soggy, so they thought it was gross.  Ours had a better crunch on it, so it tasted better.  It wasn't particularly exceptional, it was okay.  I don't remember any plantain in my dish though.  \n\n* Japanese Chicken Wings ($4) \""teriyaki and sesame\"" - It's hard to go wrong with teriyaki chicken wings, right?  Good, but messy.\n\n* Chilled Oyster Sampler ($4) \""ponzu jelly & tobiko with three oysters\"" - Really fresh oysters with an interesting ponzu jelly.  We were supposed to get another order before we left, so I missed out on more!  Next time!\n\n* Mini Yellowtail Seviche ($4) \""ginger garlic and soy\"" - Reminded me of Hawaiian poke with the dressing.  It was good with the red onions mixed in there, more poke-like than ceviche-like though.\n\n* Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos ($4) \""shiso, avocado, roasted corn miso and spicy aji panca sauce\"" \u00e2\"" Two different sauces to put over the taquitos, and it was good.  Very messy though as it broke apart after the first bite and was dripping all over my hands.  Our order came with two taquitos, but when our friend ordered it, he only got one!\n\n* Rosca ($9) \""homemade doughnuts with hazelnut chocolate dipping sauce\"" \u00e2\"" Recommended by our bartender/waitress as her favorite dessert.  Four doughnut holes arrived and they were just okay.  Disappointing for us, and we wished we had chosen another dessert instead.\n\nWe spent the whole time at the bar because there was standing room only at this event.  So, the girl making our drinks also served us.  She was busy but tried her best to make our drinks were full and our orders were in.  (Our drinks were good for the most part except for that second Obamarama we ordered.  But hey, some people like more alcohol in their cocktails!)  I had a bigger problem with the kitchen output and their consistency.  With certain orders coming out, sometimes you got two of something and other times you got one.  Our friend mentioned that we got more sushi in our order than when he ordered it.  (Makes you wonder what happened to the other pieces.)\n\nOverall, we had a decent experience at Sushi Samba.  You definitely can't beat the price and the atmosphere is casual, which is nice alternative at a strip hotel.\n\n3.5 stars.\n\nThey also offer a happy hour (Sunday through Thursday from 4 to 7 pm, and then a reverse happy hour from 10 pm to close), available in the bar area only.\n\n(Pics posted, of course!)"
0,Decided to try the The Cracked Egg because of their gluten-free offerings but was disappointed.  Husband & I had lunch and then gave another try at breakfast the next morning.  Not wonderful either time.  GF pancakes were not cooked all the way through leaving gooey middle.  Lunch had problems as well.  Service was not the best either.
0,WORST TACO PLACE !!!!! First off the cook told me to F off because they didn't serve beer. On top of  that they place was really dirty and the cashier kept talking to her friend while I was trying to order
0,"As a native Pittsburgher it breaks my heart to write this, but Primanti Bros has gone way down hill.  I think they have been featured too many times on the Travel Channel or the Food Network, maybe they are beginning to believe their own hype.  I enjoyed these sandwiches when I lived grew up in Pittsburgh, so I was quite eager to share this experience with my friends a few weeks ago.  They had never been to Pittsburgh, so this was going to be their first taste of a local favorite.  \n\nThe food:  Bread was stale, major disappointment.  The meat was non-existant, we ordered Kielbosa, Double Egg, Angus Beef and the Pittsburgher.  I am not a salt user, ever, but I had to load on the salt to get any flavor out of my sandwich.  The portions were still decent size, but who wants cold fries, tasteless meat and stale bread.  \n\nSide Items:  The appetizers were still good, but fried food is pretty hard to mess up.\n\nCost:  Price was pretty reasonable, but the food was mediocre.\n\nAmbiance - the original location is still the best, the chains are okay, but the food is lacking more so in the franchise locations."
0,"There really is not much to say that hasn't been said already, but I will write my story/review anyway...\n\nI flew Spirit a year ago to Ft. Lauderdale and had no problems, issues, or delays. This time, we flew to Vegas from O'hare Wed-Sat and it was a completely different situation. I knew about the luggage cost, so the additional $150 I had to pay for my boyfriend and I was something I was \""okay\"" with. I paid on-line the night before because it's a bit cheaper that way. For carry-on, I paid $40 each way for his bag, and for my check-in luggage, I paid $35 each way. \n\nWe arrived to O'hare on Wednesday 2/13, with clear, blue skies in Chicago and obviously in Vegas, however, there was a two hour delay. So instead of leaving at 9:09 am, we ended up departing at 10:51 am. When we asked the extremely rude lady at the counter for the reason, all we got in response was an idiotic look and a \""whhaaaaatttt?\"" At this point, my boyfriend was going crazy, but I was still \""okay\"" with the situation because I've heard A LOT worse, and read A LOT worse. \n\nFast forward three days later... we arrive to the Vegas airport about 1.5 hours before our scheduled departure at 5:20 pm. We go through check-in and all that, get to our gate, and it says 5:54 pm. Ok.. fine... we can handle 30 minutes. I step out to get a drink, and my boyfriend calls me to tell me that it just got pushed to 8pm!!!!!!!!!!!! I get back to the gate, and they announce that the plane has a maintenance issue and is currently in San Diego. Not sure how much more time passes by, but we get another announcement that the plane is now delayed until 9:30 pm and that there is something wrong with the plane and is getting a part replaced in San Diego. WOW... \n\nAt this point, they called everyone up to receive a voucher. I got in line thinking it may be a voucher for a free flight or something (HA!), though my boyfriend was against getting anything from them, and we ended up getting a voucher for a meal in the airport for $7 per person... are you freaking kidding me?! We ended up using it and it was not even enough to cover two pretzels and two drinks... thanks a lot Spirit!!! It's more like a joke than anything... \n\nAt one point in our short stay at the airport, I walked by the screen, and saw that the departure now says 10:04 pm... these bastards didn't even announce anything until 15 minutes after I saw the time on the screen. There was nothing anyone could do but wait... and that's what we all did. \n\nNEVER AGAIN am I going to fly through Spirit... I don't know how the hell this company is still in business or operating. I highly doubt that they were fixing the plane... they just don't have enough of them and what is a 5 hour delay to their passengers?!?! The staff is beyond rude.. I feel like that's a requirement when they apply for this job. I had a great trip, but this totally ruined everything and I am still recovering from exhaustion!!!"
1,AMAZING PIZZA and THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER! (Homemade cheesecake) I recommend the Peanut butter cup cheesecake. We were in a group of ten and everyone commented on how great the pizza was. Pesto pizza was the favorite for my wife. The place runs a little on the expensive side but we all thought it was worth it. I would recommend eating here when the local papa johns/dominoes type places wont cut it and you want some pizza that is on the gourmet side.
0,"Horrible customer service, went in looking for a specific pair of shoes I needed for a wedding and no one greeted me or acknowledged me at all. After I found the shoes on my own I went to check out and there was a woman already checking out and then another customer was waiting behind me and the other cashier rang them up first when I was clearly the next customer. Both cashiers were unprofessional, talking to each other the entire checkout process and never once said hi or looked at me. I'll never shop here again."
0,"Adam took me to \""a different point of view\"" to celebrate my birthday. Super nice. Beautiful view. \n\nWe get there and there are about 3 weddings going on. Enter the lobby and they tell us we can wait for our table in lobby. We see some people with drinks but don't see a bar. So I ask hostess if there is a bar. \""Not tonight because there is a wedding just go wait in lobby \"" That's kinda strange we think to ourselves, but  then it gets even weirder. As we are sitting in lobby as older couple sits down next to us and a server came and welcomed them and brought them each a glass of wine. We were completely ignored. \n\nWe were lead to our table (which was not a window view as Adam requested). We notice some waitstaff taking a rug and putting it over something right next to us. At that point we realize that they are using the rug to cover up vomit. \n\nAfter a few minutes we notice there were a lot of high school kids having dinner before prom. One of the tables of them right next to us was so drunk the girl threw up! I immediately get up to tell the hostess I want to be moved and notice a vomit trail all the way to the bathroom. \n\nWe were relocated to a table in the very back of restaurant. Service was slow and inattentive. The guy knew I was gluten free because I had a few questions. Dinner was good. \n\nAfter dinner. Waiter brought by dessert menus. We wanted to order something but he never came back. 10 minutes later he came back over and asked us what we wanted. I replied \""we would have ordered something 5 minutes ago but now we will just take our check. \"". \n\nThey knew it was my birthday because Adam had written it on opentable. The guy came back with a birthday dessert and slammed it on the table with zero comments. No candles. Nothing. And it was the most gluten containing dessert option they has. Let me say that the people across from us got candles and a different dessert that I could have eaten. \n\nTook 20 more minutes after this for us to finally get our check. \n\nHorrible experience for such a special occasion."
0,"Yelp map is still incorrect. Not that it matters. No one should ever go there to eat. It is a sports bar, off track betting, and poker hall. It was really busy on a Sunday night. Everyone was playing poker. They have a patio that is full of smokers playing poker. Come for the betting but eat first. I was happy with the beer on draft choices. They even had a beer from Sleepy Dog in Tempe on tap.\n \nWe asked the sever if they had any interesting appetizers. She said her favorite was the fried ravioli. We know we were in trouble when we took our first bite. It was almost all pasta, very little cheese inside. It was overcooked and flavorless. It came on a generous layer of tomato sauce that had absolutely no flavor.\n\nThen the pizza came. We ordered the Hawaiian pizza. Described as a white pizza with prosciutto, pineapple, cheese and coconut oil. It was white and had all the promised ingredients. The only flavor that came through was the coconut oil. There were just little flecks of prosciutto. The pineapple pieces were about the size of half a penny. There was a thin layer of cheese. The crust was terrible. It had no flavor and was salty. My wife and I agreed it was the worst pizza we had ever eaten.\n\nService was just below adequate. Come to gamble or have a beer but that is it."
0,"The food was ok. Not the type of food that you would die to have again. The waiter couldn't describe any of the dishes which made it hard for us to order. We love trying new food places especially if the food is good. \n\n Service is a big key for us. You can have outstanding food, but if your service sucks we're never coming back. Yup, the service sucked. We had to ask three different times for refills and when we asked for refills we received our response with an attitude. The waiter gave us our water by saying here and shoving it in our face, RUDE!!!!\n\nI wouldn't suggest this place to any of my friends. First impressions everything to us. \nThis is just my experience, my opinion and how I felt. \n\nAloha & hopefully others will have a better experience."
1,Not much needs to be said.  They do it right.  From the service to the food all was perfect and made for a very enjoyable night!
1,"My favorite local fish joint.  Never disappointed.  Either Local Style, Ono fish n chips, or lightly battered shrimp.  Cannot miss on a great healthy meal that won't put you in the poor house."
0,"My friend and I came here around 2 in the morning for a late dinner. I ordered the Asian Nachos and Shaking Beef. The nachos came out first as an appetizer, I took a bite, and all I can say was it was extremely salty. Both of us couldn't touch anymore of it. My Shaking Beef came out and the filet mignon was very dry and not flavorful at all. It tasted like it was overcooked, yet I asked for it to be medium-rare. The sauce was very salty as well. My friend had the Kobe Burger, and he said it was overly salty as well. This place must be only good when you're drunk, since it seems the chef's favorite seasoning is extra salt.\nOur server was quite attentive and friendly, but then again, we were the only guests at the time.\nWouldn't recommend this place, nor come back whenever I'm back in Vegas."
1,"Fresh sushi and cheap drinks? No complaints from me here :)\n\nI went twice last week--once in the daytime and then at night. At night it has more of a club-like vibe with mainstream hip hop being played here.\n\nIt's a good spot to stop at if you're hungry but don't want something too heavy on your stomach (my girl and I were going to a pool party, so we didn't want the bloated stomach look haha).\n\nIf you like tempura, definitely try the tropical roll. It has mango in it and is just sooo yummy!\n\nIf you're a tourist from the DMV like us, and you really like RA, they have a location up in Baltimore."
0,"Don't go on a holiday weekend! \n\nLiterally from the time we stepped foot into the spa, my stress level increased.  From the 15 minute wait at reception to the 10 minute wait for the tour, I should have known that the spa was too busy to care about my mother and me.  There were SO MANY PEOPLE at this spa that there was literally nowhere to SIT, let alone lay down and relax.  For example, the pool.  My guess is there were about 18 chaise lounges by the pool and about 30+ guests.  Yes, I was one of the lucky ones who got to sit on the ground, waiting for someone to leave.  Just the sort of treatment you expect to get when you pay this much, right?  But to make matters worse, multiple couples saved a lounge chair for their spouse, while said spouse went to get their spa treatment.  For an hour.  Only for both of them to leave once the spouse returned.  So there were 3 - 5 open lounges at any given time  that were being \""reserved.\""  Out of 18.  Grrr.... I found these pool guests to be inconsiderate and entitled, which really rubbed me the wrong way.  \n\nI could go on and on because I was so infuriated with this spa, but I understand that this could have been an unusual turn of events (because of the holiday and the Travelzoo deal), so I'll leave all of the dirty details out.  Nevertheless, I saw a poorly run facility that was over-crowded, overwhelmed and ill-equipped to say the least.  Dirty towels everywhere, jam-packed jacuzzis, messy grounds, slow food/bev service.  Man, it was just a disaster.  We left early so we could sit down and have a drink.  \n\nThe one highlight of the day - which was the first thing we did - was our massage.  Both my mom and I were impressed with excellent massages.  My mom wouldn't stop talking about hers and was moved by her masseuse's care and concern.  My masseuse, Linda R., was highly skilled and had the strongest hands ever.  Both are at the top of their field.  \n\nBut alas, a great massage does not make a spa.  If you're looking for a high class, relaxing, full service spa, this is NOT the best choice in this area.  BTW, it might appear that I'm the only one rating this a 1-star, but if you click on \""filtered reviews\"" at the bottom of the reviews, you'll see 5 more disgruntled customers rating it the same..."
1,This was a fun club. i celebrated my 21st birthday it was deinetly a hot spot. the music /drinks were great! Enjoyed it hands down. Definetly a memory never to be forgotten!!
1,"From the owner of Joe Beef, a restaurant where those not-so-adventurous foodies can eat. Liverpool House has a rotating menu, so many reviews have mentioned specific dishes that were nowhere on the menu. However, I will mention what was on the menu yesterday when I snagged an awesome last-minute table. There is one main dining room and the bar area- totally decked out in Canadiana- deer antlers and row boat oars. Great artwook on the walls. We sat in front of the dinner menu and throughout people had to come stand near us to take a look at the options du jour.  This could be a great way to meet some new friends!\nService was great in french and english explaining all the wacky dishes and preparations. They also aren`t bad for the eyes...\nEntrees range from $9-20 and run the gamut from Huitres (oysters) to steak taco. I tried the gnocci, as I try to do at any place that serves this dish.  It was creamy and soft- obviously made within the day.  \nPlats (main dishes) run from $25-50 for the lobster spaghetti, which I saw and it has pretty much a whole lobster on top!  Most are in the $30 range. Of the fish options, artic char or dor\u00e9, I opted for the char with a `crust`of shrimp. Awe-inspiring and tasty. This had to be the biggest peice of char I have ever seen, and the smallest plate at my table.  The pintade (guinea fowl) was served on a platter and was the size of half a chicken. The rabbit could have served two, but my SO managed to finish it off!  No room for dessert, which is maybe why they only have 3 options. No matter, they all looked good. \nThe drink selection is great which wine by the glass and a whole other wall-sized chalk board to review the wines by the bottle.  \nAt the end of the meal, I stepped to the other side of the table to the hallway labeled, `pipi room`. After a bloody ceasar (served with oyster on top) and one glass of wine left me giggling all the way home."
0,"About 20 or so years ago Vegas was trying to market itself as a \""family vacation destination\"". Luckily Vegas got smart and decided to stick to \""adult entertainment\"", which it does best.\n\nExcalibur is a big, tacky reminder of this failed attempt at good clean family fun (with a little bit of naughty mixed in). \n\nThe rooms are cheap and the location is great and if that's all you really care about, I say go for it. Because its Vegas, and all you really need a room for is sleeping and storing your stuff, right??? WRONG!\n\nYou will spend more time in your room than you think, so be comfortable. A nice room & hotel accoutrements will also help get you in a Vegas state of mind."
1,"They have really yummy flavors.  Deeeelish.  The times we've been there, they don't have like a huge variety of flavors but definitely enough to get different ones for half a dozen, maybe a dozen.  THat's good enough for me!  Pretty big cupcakes.  I think I'd rather have mine smaller but the flavors I've had there are delicious.  We definitely like coming here for  a treat!"
1,"Why yes.... I love ridiculously Americanized cream cheese and avocado-stuffed deep-fried makizushi (if you can even still call it that). And I make no apologies! Purists be damned. That being said, Sakana's rainbow roll, philly roll, and crunchy eel rolls were totally melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Crunchy eel had to be my favorite. Flaming phoenix was pretty good, too. \n\nI have to back up a bit.... I started with the ahi tataki salad. It's way bigger in person than it looked in the photo, and sooooo good (note: I normally HATE salads, just ordered it for the seared tuna and ended up eating a good amount of the salad itself). I also tried the spicy tuna roll and it was a big disappointment... BARELY any spice and the tuna tasted a little fishy, definitely not as scrumptious as the tuna in the salad. But I had so many other yummy things to nosh on, I didn't mind abandoning the spicy tuna. \n\nI'm not sure if it's a regular thing, but they had 50c appetizers if you order a Kirin. The prices on all the dishes were totally reasonable. They DON'T have a full bar, I'm not sure why there are 3 votes for that."
1,"The best Pakistani restaurant I've been to in Montreal. This place has a meh-ish nautical d\u00e9cor. The Chicken Biryani here is textbook perfect. Chicken marinated in yogurt and spices, topped with half cooked rice and cooked for hours on a mild flame. The meat is super tender and moist not to mention full of flavor and the rice has a nice aroma.  They make it everyday except Saturdays. Saturday they make lamb biryani, though I'm a fan of their chicken biryani. Also on Thursdays they have takeout special, Biryani just for 4 bucks. The Lahori Chargah (Pakistani take on the Tandoori Chicken) is great. They also have Fish BBQ'd in Tandoori spices. Quantities are huge and you get a good bang for your buck. Definitely recommended.\n\n\nFood : Good\nService :Fast\nAmbiance : O_o\nWorth the price : Yes"
0,"Although they have free wifi I have tested the network and it's under 400 kbps so your LTE network is faster. They do accept dogs at $75 per night. The pool is closed for the winter (which I didn't know before checking in. ) Oh, and they charge to have the mini fridge installed. The good thing about Harrahs is that it is on the strip and people are friendly with dogs!! ;)"
1,"I am a huge Fuego fan, and have frequented Fuego Bistro in North Central Phoenix and Fuego Cantino in North West Phoenix.  Fuego Cityscape is downstairs from the downtown Gold's Gym where me and my friend exercise (then go to Fuego for a glass of Zinfandel, which is excellent, and something delicious for dinner).\n\nMy favorite is the Chile Rellenos - honestly, the best I have ever had, although everything on their menu is delicious, with generous portions.\n\nThe manager is very friendly and helpful, and we always have a great time going to this location - which is getting to be about 2-3x per week!!\n\nI definitely need to do more cardio..."
1,"I have been here a few times now...its always clean, employees are always helpful and if you want a fantastic show...ask for Collin! He is so fun to watch. His skill throwing the scoops and the ice cream...best dessert show anywhere. He always has a smile and ready to help. Check it out...you will not be sorry."
1,"Incredible tacos, great people, they will help newbies if you are unclear about whats going on and will let you sample the different kinds of meat. Sit at one of the 5 stools at the bar and they will bring you food! The mixologist (Omar) is incredible and the spicy margarita it too good to be true! Definitely the best street tacos, and an authentic Mariachi Band on Monday evenings 6-7pm."
1,"I'm sad to report that Vietnam's Pho no longer serves banh mi. Oh well. The pho is still good, and so are the bun and the roast quail."
0,"Definitely a no no. Of all the clubs I've been to, this one was the worst. My cousins and I walked in and literally walked out because it was so humid. It was like walking into a sauna. It was small and it wasn't even crowded, but it was so stuffy. I can't imagine if it was crowded. You would probably suffocate."
1,"I stopped in to buy some oil but left with a complete oil change, at a significantly lower cost than what the local VW dealers charge. My vehicle takes synthetic oil so I'm used to being charged more however, the counter person, offered me a few discounts and assured me that the change would be done and I'd be back on the road within 30 minutes. He didn't lie. \n\nThey allowed my dog to wait with me in the waiting area, which in itself was a surprise for me because my dog isn't small - she's 60 pounds. She's also a senior canine though so all she did was lay at my feet for the twenty or so minutes it took for the change. \n\nThey pointed out some issues that aren't urgent but that I already knew about and I was on my way as promised. \n\nIf only all shops offered service like this."
0,"Horrible service. Horrible food. Meals were delivered to the table at separate times not all at once. They forgot a dinner. A party of 4, each eating diner alone. Manager/owner/whoever he was... took the price of a raw, inedible, cold in the middle hamburger off the bill but did it like he was doing us a favor. Our to go order was wrong. Cigarette smoke from the patio wafted in over our table the whole meal. Never again. Truly one of the worst meals/experiences EVER."
0,"This place is nothing too special for me. Overpriced drinks (well, it's in Vegas so...) and incredibly long wait on hot afternoons. But it's in a relatively good location in the middle of the Forum Shops so I see how it's very accessible for people."
1,"This is my favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas!\n\nThey have a variety of food on their menu but the best items to order from is their \""Local/Island Menu\"" which includes their Portuguese sausage, eggs & rice. \nThey give you the whole sausage; not just a couple of pieces so it's great!\nOh & can't forget their banana nut muffin that comes with the meal (or you can get toast); it is DELICIOUS!!\nIt's freshly baked so it's warm and moist.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is very cute. Everything is barn themed with egg designs. The servers are friendly and the food comes out quick!\nAnd not to mention this place is decently priced. They used to have a lot of coupons in the local vegas magazines so it would make your meals even cheaper!"
0,"Unless you just want to look at a nice view do NOT stay in the Ivory Suite at the Palms. The room is large and pretty, but totally non-functional.\n\n1. There are no outlets near the bed. The closest outlet is across the room and not practical for any electronical items. My husband had to wait a out an hour for someone to come and help. Although Jason was very nice he had to find a friend's extesion cord.\n\n2.The are no drawers any place in the room. The night stand is a counter only and there is no place to put your wallet, keys etc. The desk is also a counter without drawers.\n\n3. Not drawers for clothes. The closet is in the bathroom with open shelves only and sliding closet doors that prevent the stacked hanger rods from oulling out so you can get to your clothes.\n\n4. You might think a nice shower would be helpful BUt there is no door in the shower and there are no shelves for soap or shampoo and no hook or door to hang a towel on so you have to put it on the floor, it us freezing because you have to walk into the shower to turn it on, so you are walking through cold water and with no door it is freezing.\n\n5. I asked for foam pillows as I am allergic to feathers, just got back to the room ti get ready for bed and they brought more feather pillows but no fiam, ahhhhhhh.\n\nWhen Icalled the front desk the we nit that helpful. Very disappointed."
1,"A bit of a trendy downtown-type place, but food is amazing and the ambiance is very cool. When we went on Thursday night it was pretty busy, although the patio was closed (probably a good thing on a summer night). The only downside was that we had to wait a while fire our server to check in on us and others seemed to gaffe the same issue. Not sure if it was unusually buddy for a midweek night, our if they need an extra server or two to help distribute the attention to the customers. \n\nOverall, though, a great experience, we look forward to returning to St. Francis!"
0,The food is good but the wait is always way too long. Anytime of day they are slow. There's no reason to go to Filibertos cause there are other places nearby.
0,"Worst Port of Subs Ever! The meat was not even thick enough to make it from the slicer down to the sandwich. Then they threw on the toppings like it was a game of ultimate frisbee. Then they cut the sandwich on the wrapping tearing it prior to throwing it in a bag. By the time we arrived at our destination we had to try and piece together our sandwich so we could eat it. Just a lot of cost cutting that sacrificed the quality of the product. This area already has a severe lack of food options, I am sad that I cannot frequent this place in the future."
0,"I have to start out by saying I have never used this company for anything. However I sat behind two of their techs (in uniform) and overheard their conversation over lunch. Can't count how many times they dropped the F-bomb, then they were discussing a service call that came in, and one of the two recommended that because it was a warranty call, he should just do a drive by and say there was no one home!! No concern for the representation of the company or who may be overhearing this sad conversation."
0,"I don't recommend this place.\n\nThe staff aren't as friendly and warm. Though I feel that can be easily changed. The food though is poorly prepared, made with pre-packaged ingredients. Little Pho Saigon has little heart in their business. You'll leave feeling like you ate nothing at all. If Pho is on your mind, there are places further down closer to China Town that at least have better quality meals. \n\nI will mention that I've tried to give most of these Saigon named restaurants a try and they all seem to follow the same guidlines. I'll review again in a few years."
0,Not a big sushi fan but at 10pm this turns into a club. Music wasn't great to me. I thinks it just a big fashion show for young people. Didn't stay long
1,"Yogurtland........ Is........The......Best.... Hands down. Look up \""Fro-yo\"" in a dictionary and a storefront of Yogurtland is the main picture.\n\nThere are so many imitators out there, and some taste pretty good...Many however, do not.... blech. Yogurtland however, is as consistent in quality as any food service place I can possibly remember. The flavors are fresh, they keep everything up to date and change with the season their flavors. \n\nMy personal fave will always be Pistachio, it is just that good. With the widest variety of non-fat and low-sugar yogurts, it truly is a healthy option to go for. It actually gives you no reason to get ice cream, when a MUCH MUCH healthier option is sitting and staring at your gut.\n\nEverything is tasty as can be and the location is also kept clean, which is why I chose to write on this one specifically. LONG LIVE YOGURTLAND!"
1,"Zio is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Charlotte. Walk down a couple of steps and you feel like your walking into your own home. The staff could not be more accommodating and friendly. We made a reservation for a party of ten for my birthday and they had everything set and ready to go when we walked in. \n\nThey make some of the best desserts I've had in town the chocolate cake is a must. My friends had ordered an entire cake for my birthday and they were more then happy to let me take the rest pf the cake home with the pan and everything. \n\nAs far as the entrees go the salmon picatta is excellent , they make homemade pastas with their dishes that alone is worth trying this little find. I crave the Caesar salad, and the wedge salad is just as good. \n\nIt's a little hard to find I always look for the Boston Market on Providence as my guide. \n\nI always see people running in to pick up pizza's to go I have not had the opportunity to try their pizza yet but I look forward to it on my next visit."
1,"The word incredible comes to mind when I think upon the date my fiancee and I had there.  The atmosphere is perfect.  Very zen lounge.  Music in the backround included Theivery corporation and Zero 7. (Two of our favorites).\nThe wine list was huge, and had a greta assortment.  We didn't know what to do with ourselves, so we dived right in with the 5 course tasting menu combined with wine pairings.  My God was it worth every penny.  We could not even finish the last course!  Everything was so delicious and elegantly plated.  Definately not your standard american fare. If you see something on the menu called \""Bacon and Eggs\"" Don't question it. Just order it.  It was the most amazing thing ever.  They use fresh local and organics ingredients for their products.  The tasting menu was 65 a person and 30 to add on the wine.  It was superb.  I am looking for excuses to go back!\n\nAlso-- I do not agree with the \""Casual\"" dress attire. I think this is a place where people should dress up a bit."
1,"Very small selection of flavors and toppings, and you can't serve yourself. I like the feeling of eating a healthier dessert than ice cream or other frozen yogurt places. Not too many choices for toppings, but overall it was a good refreshing experience."
0,"I seriously don't understand the hype about this place. I've been there twice and was not really impressed. First of all the tacos are tiny. The meat is decent but they are really small. The first time I was there I ordered 2, and the guy said \""Thats it?!\"". They we're decent, not fantastic.\n\nNext time I tried the Fries with adobado. It's basically a pile of fries, topped with your choice of meat, guacomole, sour cream, some kind of mayo based sauce and unmelted shredded cheese. It's great if you're trying to consume 2000 calories in 1 meal.... I didn't really like them to be honest. They should melt the cheese. \n\nNothing about this place stands out, I seriously think the Mexican food in LV is lacking... and this place is no different."
1,"Had an opportunity to try a Pasty for lunch and I'll give it a 4 only because at the price it's not the best value around but well prepared shepherd's pie had good ingredients and overall I wish I didn't split it with a friend as I could have eaten the entire pasty for a a hearty filling lunch, next time order two and split them for a variety pack."
1,"We celebrated our first wedding anniversary at Alize.  I simply cannot imagine a way the experience could have been better.  The decor is lovely but simple so as not to take anything away from the breathtaking panaramic view of the strip.  The service is top notch but the staff retain their sense of humor avoiding the stuffiness that often accompanies fine dining.  I am a complete \""Sally\"" and almost always have to rearrange the menu choices to suit my tastes.  Everything on the menu was paired so perfectly (and uniquely) that the only challenge was what to order.  The dishes were created so imaginatively that even items we've eaten thousands of times before (like the crabcake offered on the crab trio appetizer) tasted like something brand new.  Every item was prepared perfectly and with incredible flavor.  The dishes were plated beautifully and served with flourish. The spinach risotto topped with lobster and a beuure blanc sauce was as beautiful to look at as it was to eat.  The complimentary courses from the chef  were perfect additions.  The wine listed is excellent and the cocktails were some of the best we had in Vegas.    We found out the next day that it was recently voted one of the top 75 restaurants in the world.  It certainly tasted that good.  In a city full of amazing restaurants, this one is truly a gem that should not be missed."
1,"What a wonderful Italian pizzeria! My friends and I went here for my birthday and had a great time drinking wine and eating pizza. The pizza was absolutely delicious. My husband and I also split a wonderfully fresh and delightful salad. I had leftovers and confirmed that the pizza was just as good the next day, even though I wasn't tipsy anymore :)\n\nMy only complaint is that I felt very rushed by the server. We were taking our time chatting and enjoying ourselves, and the server kept coming by like, every 2 minutes to see if we were ready to order. Did we look ready? No. I quickly had to scan the meny and we told him that we wanted salads as appetizers first, but he still made us put in the entire order \""because that's how the chefs like it\"". In fact, if I were focused more on the service I would only give Pomo 3 stars, but I won't cause I liked the pizza so much."
0,"First time there, was not too bad, service was ok.  Second time, food tasted like a frozen dinner, service is very poor.  Will not eat here again."
0,"Not impressed.  Its dark, dated and overrated.   Seriously dont waste your money.  After seeing the dirty kitchen on the way out I wanted to call the health department.  The food was bland and did not seem fresh.    Many other options that are so much better.   DONT GO.  PICTURES MISLEADING."
0,Can not pay for delivery with a Corleone's gift card so  REALLY!!  had to go pick up got there late still had to wait 15-20 min the guy on the phone was cool but the bottom line the pizza taste like card board and the wings put it this way i got 48 wings and 2 large pizza's for 6 people they all had a slice and a wing or two after that no one would touch it bottom line Corleone's sucks!!!
1,"i've been here a few times, and they do actually close at some point during the day because at 7am one morning, they were closed.\n\nbut it's like any other convenience store, but not as glitzy and there's no buffet of cheap coffee, donuts, or lunch-ables like the modern circle k's. \n\nwhat sets D's apart is the family that owns it. while there one afternoon, the owner, George, greeted everyone as if he'd known them for years. he even knew their names. Same with his wife...she had just baked some cookies and gave me a few. yes, i'll pretty much eat anything so i did, and they were good!\n\na great little local establishment."
0,I was excited to try Lagasse's Stadium and the BLT. It was too loud for conversation. Seating uncomfortable. Slow considering how few people were in the place. \n\nThe pork belly on the BLT was more like a dried thin porkchop. The bread was toasted to the crisp that leaves your mouth injured. I barely ate it.\n\nThe pretzel appetizer  was delish. It truly saved the meal.
0,"I continue to go to this location because its the closest to my home however today is my last day there! There is an employee who is so RUDE (she refused to give me her name) I asked her for a marker and she said she didn't have one. She's always on the very far left. SHE'S SUCH A B*****!!! So then I said, \""it's a post office and you don't have a marker?\"" So then I asked the sweet looking employee next to her for a marker and she was happy to lend it to me. So then I come back to other this rude employee and told her, \""you really couldn't just ask someone for a marker?\"" \""How hard was that\"" ... I asked to speak to a manager and want to know what the manager said to me?! She said \""do not disrespect my employee\"" \n\nOMG!!!! \n\nAnyway before with the white lady on the very very far left, she has short hair. She's such a bitch!!"
1,"Been here a few times and I always enjoy the food.  I think of this place as having good ,but not exciting or overly spectacular, food.  Service has always been spot on for me.  The dinner choices are pretty standard, but I've only have a few of the most common ones, Orange Chicken, fried rices, a few other stir fry's etc.\n\nSo the sushi thing. I've never had anything but the rolls here. They're big, more than one bite for each piece, and come with about 8 pieces each.   I like them. I know that a Crunchy roll or a Spider roll may not be true sushi but I don't care I still like them. Damn good I tell ya."
1,"Al Donut's were scrumptious! I stopped by on my way to work this morning. They didn't have a ton to choose from as it was already nearer to 8am. But I did notice some of the  donuts were LARGE! \n\nThe woman working the counter was very friendly. I chose a chocolate cake donut with chocolate frosting and it was yummy. For 80 cents, you can't beat it.\n\nA small shop, with hand written signs in the window. It has seating inside if one chooses to eat there.  It was nice to support a local business instead of one of those larger chains who all taste the same!\n\nTry it some time!"
0,"This is about the portrait studio inside JC Penny at the Arrowhead location. One word comes to mind about my experience with the staff there: HORRIBLE. Each staff member I came in contact with was so rude and condescending. They were running so behind, we waited 45 minutes to even get into the room to do the pics. The lady who checked us in and talked to us about what we wanted was so rude, cutting me short on ideas and acting as tho we weren't worth the time. The photographer was such a B****. She did not listen to anything we wanted and treated my 3 month old as a nuisance. The pics were just about my daughter but she turned to me looked me up and down, said \""Nevermind\"" then turned to my husband and asked him to get into the pics with our daughter. RUDE. She took a total of 8 pictured before the other photographer rushed in and started to hurry us out. I will never go back here."
0,"Honestly, I swear that my husband and I have nothing against Aliante Station but I find myself writing yet another bad review for one of their restaurants. The other review- PiPs.\n\nI love mexican food (heck- I love all ethnic foods) and was really craving some Mexican. My husband is not a big fan but indulged me. I wish I had chosen a different restaurant. I ordered the combination plate of Tamales and Enchilada verde. My husband ordered the Enchiladas De Mariscos (basically scallops, shrimp, halibut enchilada w/. usual fillings). \n\nThere was nothing special or wonderful about the combo dish. In fact, it was lacking in favorite and the rice was very bland. As for my husband's enchilada, it was gross. There was just too much seafood in the shell and quite frankly the choice of seafood was not very complimentary together. I think the restaurant needs to replace this item with only halibut and replace the exisiting shrimp enchilada with a citrus shrimp (grilled) enchilada.\n\nOnly good things about this restaurant: great margaritas and the complimentary chips & salsa. \n\nWould we recommend this place? NO. \nAnd now it will be even tougher to get my husband to go to a mexican restaurant! In the meantime, I'll just continue eating at the food court (dunkin donuts is the best before a Sunday matinee)."
0,"So I decided to stop by this car wash at around 1:30 on a Saturday and that was my first mistake. After waiting in a line the attendant told me if I wanted any part of my interior done it would be over an hour before they even touched my car. I shrugged it off, it's understandable it's the middle of a busy day. After deciding to just get the exterior done I went through their wash and parked so they could hand dry my car. Thankfully that only took around twenty minutes and I had nothing bad to say at that point, just a little frustrated by the wait. After leaving I stopped to get gas and inspected my car, there was still so much dirt. It was clear they skipped several spots and were just rushing to get me through. The gas station I stopped at was outside choice and as I saw a beautifully washed car drive out I knew I'd made the wrong choice for a car wash. Stay away from this place, they don't care about your business."
1,"I'm not going to lie - I didn't have high hopes for NBN. I have a hard time beliving that one restaurant can master an array of cuisines and I generally tend to prefer places that specialize in one whether it be Chinese, Italian, Greek,  etc. That being said, when my co-worker suggested it I thought it couldn't hurt to at least try it out.\n\nIt is a fast-casual set up making it ideal for lunch. You order at the counter, get your number, and they bring it to you-simple and fast. \n\nI decided to try the spicy cajun pasta- I believe it was a VERY reasonable $7. A few minutes later and out came a heaping bowl of pasta. I could have easily split the portion into two meals for myself- but I did not have any leftoves because it was so good. I couldn't believe my taste-buds but the penne were perfectly al dente, the sauce creamy-zesty perfection, loads of slighlty-crisp red peppers and topped with grated parmesan. I honestly was shocked that this came out of a fast-casual place and cost so little. \n\nThe restaurant itself appeared clean and pretty standard. It is ideal for lunch or a quick/super casual dinner. It also seemed very kid-friendly with choices like buttered noodles. \n\nI definitely will return- and am hoping it is every bit as delicious as last time!"
0,"It is old.  Walls are paper thin, it's almost like the noise from the hall and other nearby rooms is amplified.  Is that even possible?  The room did appear clean.  No security at all, just a young girl behind the front desk.  Doors to both streets wide open and vagrants milling around the openings, lounge, and lobby.\n\nThe worst part is the \""manager\"".  Shortly after checking in (mid-afternoon), we decided this is not going to work.  We took our luggage back downstairs and turned in the key, leaving the room exactly as it was when we arrived.  The desk clerk called the manager, who said we would be charged one nights room + a $50 early departure fee.  We asked to speak with the manager and were told she would not talk to us.\n\nEveryone else says this place is cheap, but a $170 charge for not even staying there seems a little pricing to me.  We are no having to dispute the charge with the CC bank."
0,"Oooooo FAIL.  Ok so its late and you're thinking \""man I want some food...hey that place is open...lets check it out\"".   We were the only people there to eat...others were there chatting up the bartender and gaming.    Guys... How in a place with only 2 customers do you serve cold... Not luke-warm but cold tacos?   Chicken nachos were pretty good, but cold tacos?  Hey I get it its late, but either you're open for business or you're not.   sorry guys"
0,"I really don't understand all the positive reviews.  I really don't.  Let me preface my review by saying that I've always liked Penn and Teller, but this didn't do it for me.\n\nMy scary future in-laws were in town.  They are simple people with simple tastes, so they really wanted to see a magic show.  Fine.  When they got a coupon for half-off this show, I was a little concerned that it would be too abstract for their tastes.  Little did I realize that I wouldn't even like it myself!  Every trick took for-freaking-ever to do.  Sometimes I just wanted Penn to shut his pie hole and do the trick rather than talking it to death.  We weren't very far away, but I still had trouble seeing.  I can't imagine how bad it was for people in the balcony!  Sometimes Penn spoke so quickly and quietly that I couldn't even understand him from our distance.  \n\nAll in all, I felt like the act was lacking the usual Penn and Teller energy.  I can't describe it, but something was \""off\"".  Maybe they've been doing this too long and they're sick of it.  I'm glad we didn't pay full price or we would have felt more cheated than we did.  Definitely the most disappointing show we've seen."
1,"I am very picky with restos but with our original flight cancelled, I had to give up my reservations at Mon Ami Gabi. So the hubby and I walked the strip hunting down a place to grab some grub. We decided to check this place out. Typical Vegas resto, loud BUT the gal was gracious enough to ask us if we want to be seated at the back. Adam was our server and he was a gem. We are easy diners, got the staples, guac with chips (in love with avocados) and split the fajitas. Food was good, the mango margarita was yummy but our server made a difference between as so-so dinner to an enjoyable one!"
1,Food was very good an tasted fresh! The cat fish an shrimp was amazing. I will go back!
0,"Incredibly rude people work here. I walked in just to check out their sale. Way expensive for what you get. This isn't Prada so why are their suits $450? Hhhhmmm\n\nThey pretty much treated me like I didn't belong there. I guess being heavily tattooed means I must be poor. My bad, I'll just spend my hard earned wad of cash at other stores. The lady kept following me everywhere as if I was going to steal. Nice! Keep in mind, you work retail so customer service is important. Guess they didn't teach them that here."
0,"I was very looking forward to staying at the D hotel after all they have a pool. First of I want to say that everyone who isn't a manager is AWESOME they are polite, friendly, and genuinely seem happy to make sure you are having a good time. They got the Hotel my 2 stars!While we were there we attempted to use the WiFi but it asked me for my credit card, and then I looked at the little packet where I got my key cards and it said WiFi available  ask for rates. So I assumed I was mistaken about the free WiFi. Then apon check which I attempted on the TV it said I owed almost $70.00 Dollars in resort fees. No don't get me wrong I am very used to resort fees but I am used to them in better hotels and you actually get services for your money. I did call down to the \""guest services\"" and they informed me that the resort fee covered Free Wifi (WTF), Free local calls (who doesn't have a cell phone?), and the coupons I got with my key card. Seriously $22.00/per day+tax for Wifi I couldn't get into, calls NOONE needs to make and coupons which I believe was bogo fora lame show, and something about Keno. (Who plays keno when you under 90?) When I called down to see what could be done I got a very snotting -well your checking out-- so why bother being nice to you now ? attitude. I finally called back and talked to someone else who was nice enough to remove one of the charges. I am still not very pleased. I don't mind when I have to pay for things but I expect something in return.  The casino is small and after about an hour I felt like I played everything. (A lot of repeating games) Also the D Club (the players club) and the gift store no where near the room elevators, neither are the bathrooms. It would be nice to walk out of the elevator and find such things right away, that way I could spend more money. I actually went across to the Fremont's gift shop to buy something because I couldn't find ours. The ELEVATORS are not for the faint of heart. They are a little small (which is okay) but add to that the fact that they shake and rattle as they go down. I want to gamble in Vegas just not with my life. We did stop in to the Coney Island Hot Dogs they were ok ... not great, not bad, just ok. Like getting hot dog at the mall, again staff there amazing. I couldn't find the other restaurant there. The Room was very nice and the maid was great. I would have preferred to have a table in there vs a desk. We had to eat sitting on our beds. The pool it is a salt pool which is great, it was warm enough for me to get in a plus, the Jacuzzi was nice, but there was a note in the room letting you know that towels are at the pool and that you shouldn't take them from the room. But when I got to the pool at noon on Friday, there was a rack for towels but no towels and there aren't any employee's right there, in fact you have to cross the driveway where you valet your car to get there (literally dodging cars. and man the pool needs at least a mini bar, and drink service. Also it closes at 7pm which is a bummer because I like to dip in the Jacuzzi after a night of gambling.  All in all it was okay but I think next year when I go I will be choosing a different Hotel and Will not be returning to the D."
1,"(Lyrics - Rihanna ft. Mikky Ekko - Stay)\n\nAll along it was just shavings\nA cold ice freezing believer\nI threw my hands in the air I said show me something\nHe said, if you dare then add a little chocolate\n\nRound and around and around and around I went\nOhhh now tell ya now tell ya now tell ya now I know (what to order)\n\nNot really sure how to feel about it\nSomething in the way it taste\nMakes me feel like I can't live without it\nIt takes me to a cooler place\nI want some more Snoh.......!\n\nI was \""snow\"" ice shavings were first brought to my attention when I traveled to LA.  Wasn't sure what the rave was about, but I gave it a try.  At the time I thought it was a pretty cool concept and didn't know why Phoenix didn't have it --- Cause we live in the damn desert!  \n\nFinally, \""Snoh\"" ice was brought to us by this place -- Thank you Snoh Ice Shavery.  You didn't even come up with some weird name, just tell us what it is; ice shavings with consistency like snow haha!  \n\nThe place itself has a LA tea boba shop feel.  A lot Asian kids hanging around and reading some Manga.  Man I'm getting too old for this place!  \n\nOverall, \""snoh\"" shavings here are pretty good.  Your choice of toppings from gummy bears, tapioca, lychees, strawberries, and chocolate syrup.  Similar to your self-pour yogurt shops, but \""snoh\"" is ice shavings so you amount of calories are much much much more lower than your average desert.  That's why I totally appreciate this awesome invention.  Not to say you should eat this for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.  Everything in moderation is fine.  Our host was very gracious and also the marketer for this place.  Well done my friend, but I still think Ironman would crush Batman! Wink! - Enjoy!"
1,"Holy cow talk about BBQ this place is awesome. It was my first time there and it was packed and now I know why. Food is excellent. Service is good. The meats are amazing had the brisket, chicken, beef ribs, Mac and cheese, salad etc....oh and the corn bread the best I ever had."
1,Lunch was very good!  Service was exceptional!  Wonderful atmosphere!  We had the  fish and chips and the Reuben!  We will be trying it for the Prime Rib dinner some Wed. evening or the live music dining on Friday nights.  This is a special place.  There is indoor and outdoor dining in an area that overlooks the pond!
0,"FYI, I just called and Penazzi is no longer open."
1,"In a world of Starbucks, this is a rare gem.  The espresso beans are awesome & they will sell you some to take home.  I don't really go for flavored beans, but they have those too.  They have a big selection of baked goods and the scones are buttery and amazing.  They have a great selection of teas & brew every cup fresh.  The pomegranate green tea is awesome. I love that they still have punch cards to get your 10th drink free (any way you want it)."
1,"When I first discovered chicken and waffles, I had a whole new world of cuisine open up to me. WC+D was not quite that eye opening however.\n\nThe building doesn't look like much from the outside, and even once you come inside it doesn't blow you away. The outside patio is quite nice (and I assume they will be working on the outside of the building a bit more considering they haven't been open for long and still have an ad for the old business on their doors).\n\nHowever, you come here for the food. I ended up getting a dozen wings with korean chili. These wings are not tiny wings like you get at other places, so half a dozen was more than enough for me (but I get dinner for later). The taste was wonderful. It was the right amount of spice and a little sweetness. The green onions were a good addition. However, as most wings are, these are super messy. However, having to lick off the extra sauce at the end was a nice bonus.\n\nI ended up getting a chipotle limon sugar donut. It was okay. It wasn't bad, but it was nothing special. I really wanted to replicate the chicken and waffle taste palette, but screwed up with the sauce wings and non plain donut."
0,"I got food poisoning from their food after talking to the hostess about the poor service we received. They were very rude and,  I'm guessing,  did something to my food.  Horrible experience!"
1,"Yay - a FTR for Gabi K!\n\nLocated on Market Street at DC Ranch, Autostrada is the latest concept in Chef Aaron May's \""collection\"" of unique restaurants in the Valley.  Autostrada, which means \""an expressway or highway in Italian\"" serves cuisine from all around Italy.  With a capacity of less than 50 inside and another 45 outside, it's small, but the design which includes glass, steel, wood and concrete, gives this hot new restaurant a sleek, industrial vibe inside which goes with the theme very well.\n\nI had the opportunity to attend a pre-opening dinner at Autostrada last night... I believe they will be open to the public in the next few days.  I cannot be tough on the restaurant, as it was their first night open, and I was extremely impressed nonetheless.\n\nWe waited a short while to get seated, but it was a pleasure since the bartender, Erica (aka Red for her red hair) was sweet, attentive, and knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and the menu.  They don't have their complete wine / drink menu going just yet, but I learned the majority of the wines will come from Italy, and they will also be offering a wide range of cocktails.  We enjoyed a pinot noir and cabernet while we waited.\n\nOnce seated, Shanda took care of us... For our antipasti course, I went with the cauliflower soup and J chose the caprese tower.  In addition to these starters, we quickly made friends with the couple next to us, and the next thing I know, we're sharing their cheese plate - hey, nothing wrong with that, right?  \n\nNext up, I had a tiella casserole of grilled veggies including eggplant, zucchini, parmesan cheese and a zesty tomato sauce - it was delicious! And J's fettucini with scallops and mushrooms was pretty amazing as well.  We could've stopped here, but we kept going.\n\nFor the Segundi course, I chose the sea bass and J had the veal... this is where Autostrada has a few kinks to work out, but remember, it's their first night open... I didn't love the fish - wasn't a fan of the cold veggies on the plate or the sauce which came on the fish.  The veal however, was fantastic - and I'm not usually a veal fan!  It was served on polenta - yum!  Our new friends at the table next to us chose the steak and the halibut... and again - steak was a hit while the fish dish - not so much.\n\nWe finished with the dessert that Shanda recommended, the crepes with chocolate and strawberries... omg they were scrumptious.\n\nAs you can tell, we had a lot of food... and our bill proved it coming in at around $100 before tip.  But, we had a lot of fun, made some new friends, and found several other menu items to go back for next time we're in the DC Ranch hood... plus, Autostrada will be open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner seven days a week.  \n\nWith the casual environment, friendly attentive staff, and the magical management/ownership team behind Autostrada, I'm sure they will be a success.  Buon appetito!"
1,"Yet again a very inexpensive and very friendly experience. We decided to stay again at the hostel and got a private room with a full-size bed that demanded that you rise by at least 8 am. Hey, you don't stay at a hostel to sleep without end or shag with comfort! No! It's cheap, friendly, safe and doesn't break the bank. Please note: Limited parking is extremely limited and the street parking directly in front is metered. Walk about 4-5 blocks West and the free parking is plentiful. Take your shoes off and stay a while!"
1,"I love breakfast places.  After 10 years in the Bay Area (where breakfast places are an art), I thought my breakfast dining days were over.  Not so...Thank you Orange Table!!  A slice of neighborhood heaven in Scottsdale's Civic Center.  The coffee is good, the service was warm and welcoming, the menu is varied and yummy.  I loved the art on the wall and the vibe here is very neighborhood hang out and very little of the Starbucks cookie cutter.  Bonus that you can bring your dog!!"
1,"We were driving around and I decided I wanted Chinese food, when we found one with good reviews and when we arrived it was closed...........Dang!  so we decided to find the nearest one and give it a shot...........We walked into Ming-Gee and was pleasantly suprised to find a very clean and friendly place.........We were seated in a booth and was waited on right away.........Very friendly staff and we ordered War won ton soup and orange chicken and Crab puffs, oh, and Pork fried rice.........Very good, cannot complain about a darn thing..........The Orange chicken was a bit spicy and we loved it........the crab puffs, were so delicious and the pork fried rice, NICE........can't forget the War won ton, pleanty of fresh veggies and the taste was worth going back again...........We recommed, give it a try.   pretty sure you will be glad you did!!"
0,"I've gone to Culver's twice on my lunch hour since writing my last review. \n\nI have to say my second and third experience was not as good as the first. While the food is still easily the best chain fast food out there, the service leaves much to be desired. \n\nBoth times I sat waiting 40 minutes for my food while confused staff members walked around aimlessly with people's orders trying to figure out what belonged with who. \n\nUnlike the other Culver's locations I have been to, the staff at this location are not very friendly. They act overly friendly as if they have been told it is part of their job. But it comes off as insincere and even a bit patronizing. (Is there anything worse than being patronized by a snot-nosed teenage fast food worker?)\n\nIf you want to try out a Culver's, I recommend avoiding this one and going to the one on Peoria or  the one on Deer Valley."
1,"Best fish in town for sushi.\n\nHowever,  anyone else notice that the standard type rolls (yellowtail, salmon, etc) went from 8pc to 6pc?  \n\nThat would be OK if the 6 pieces were as large as the original 8, but they are not.  It leaves me and my wife needing to order an entire extra roll just to eat the same amount as previously served.\n\nI would have preferred a couple dollar price increase to get the original quantity of food.  \n\nThe fish is great and the service is great, but the value has diminished and caused me to look elsewhere."
1,With all the selections of themed places (yuk) I wanted tom find a nice mom and pop in a sea of coyote ulgies. This one looked good and I am very happy to report it lived up to it's recommendations. I had some nan bread and chicken curry and it was great. Seemed like a clean tidy place and the staff was very friendly and attentive. I will be back!
0,"Terrible customer service from a girl named Max. She's blonde and has curly hair. Never has someone been that rude to me in my entire life. She was addressing me very inappropriately and in an unprofessional manner after slandering me and overstepping her boundaries by making comments that attacked not only my character, but then delved into my personal life as if it were her own. I was honestly speechless, and that's rarely the case. Her facts were definitely wrong. If they had been accurate I would have been less off put, but the things she was saying are false. Being as I have never discussed my personal life with her."
1,"Was is good.. Yes\nDid it blow me away.. No\n\nI arrived here about 4:45pm Monday evening. It was me and the photographer for AZ Republic. \n\nI look over the menu and the salsa bar and man did it look good. I was hoping there was a sample platter or something but the best I could come up with was the 2 Taco meal. \n\nI opted for the Chicken and the pork, one of each. \n\nWhat I liked: \n-Chips with out having to order them separate.  \n-Tacos full of meat. \n-Staff was nice\n-Rice and Beans were good. \n-The salsa bar...way cool\n\nMeh:  \n-Corn shell was overcooked on 1/2 (one side)\n-meat was boring without salsa, good thing there is like 20 to choose. \n\n\nIt seems like the upscaled two hippies and it worked! 3.5 out of 4"
1,Walked in with a cracked screen and walked out 10 min later with it looking brand new! Thanks for the fast service!!!
1,"This was first experience using movers.  The owner personally called Sunday before the move to confirm.  At 7am sharp, the truck arrived, the staff was courteous and started right away.  They were quick, efficient, and carefully packed everything to make sure nothing would break during the move.  \n\nWhen they arrived at the new home, they once again got to work right away without taking a break.  Again, they quickly and efficiently unpacked the truck, and placed the belongings where we requested.  They assembled furniture, help to organize garage storage, and even doubled checked if anything needed to removed.\n\nThese guys were great!  I would highly recommend them to anyone, and will call again if needed."
0,"Worst service I have ever received in a restaurant!! If I were Gordon Ramsay I would be embarrassed to put my name on it. I was there on New Year's Eve and the restaurant was empty. Their dinner special was 100.00 per person. We asked if they had another option and were given their ala cart menu. My friend and I both ordered the sliders and a pear ale. We waited for a long time for our food to arrive. When it did I was shocked at how small portion was. The sliders were about the size of a half dollar coin and were nothing but bread and dried out burger. I only ate one because I was having a hard time swallowing the dried out mess. After receiving our food our waitress didn't come back. I then asked a busser for a to go box ( I would have just left the food but for those prices I was taking it with me), he didn't return. When we saw him again my friend reminded him I was waiting for a box. He apologized and brought me one. My friend held up her credit card for at least 30 minutes trying to get our waitress to bring our check. Finally when the busser brought my to go box we asked him to get our waitress to bring our check. We noticed that a couple who were seated about the time we got our food had still not had anyone approach their table and take their order by the time we finally got our check. When we received our check we found they had already tacked on a 20 percent gratuity. I guess they do that because they would never receive a tip otherwise. My recommendation.... Don't Go There!!!"
0,"This was the second time my parents and I tried this place. The first time the service was bad, we were ignored most of the time, and when we asked for something we were given attitude. After the meal I complained to the manger and he offered us two free breakfasts if we came back. So it's been 6 months and we decided to try again. Sad to say it wasn't any better. We were given a booth up front so I thought we would have more attention. Nope it's a thursday morning they were not busy, and my father and I only got a refill once on our coffee. We didn't even see the waitress until the food was delivered. The prices were high for the quality you got as well. Never going back to that location. If I'm going to pay that much I would rather go to JAMMS. At leaset you are taken care of and are met by friendly people."
1,"My first visit to Su Vino was for a friend's \""wine\"" shower... We had appetizers and bottled a great red blend.  The winery had actually created personalized labels with an ultrasound picture of my friend's baby (super cute), we bottled them with the intention of opening them on Olivia's first birthday... but I opened the bottle earlier and the wine was great.\n\nOther visits to Su Vino have always been on a live music night...  they have really great musicians.  I love Matt Thorten and two weekends ago a great jazz band was playing.   The wine is good and a great price, I usually have the peachy keen or the summer rain... but because of the great servers (trying to get me out of the box specifically Travis and Joey) I have moved on to different reds (I really like the cab merlot blend).  \n\nI typically go to the winery with a crowd and it's always busy... the service is great even when swamped.  The staff actually take the time to explain the different types of wine (last time I was there my friends all had tastings), where the grapes come from etc etc  I was very surprised about Hilary W's post... I've NEVER had any of those issues...\n\nOverall it's a great place to take friends, have a get together or bottle your own wine (i love the ability to personalize)..."
1,"Wow... love this place! First time, we ordered a thin crust pizza and it was wonderful, even compared to the thousands that I've ordered when living in Chicago all my life. Asked to have it cooked a little bit well done because of the delivery time in the car, didn't want it to slide around. Yummy. But the second time we ordered... OMG! We chose the Pan pizza, canadian bacon. Soooooooo good. Not because of the topping, although the tasty little squares of canadian bacon were great, but because of the CRUST! I usually don't get too excited about thicker crust, but this was crispy, not doughy, and ABSOLUTELY DELISH! Next time, I'm going to eat AT the restaurant instead of having it delivered and will try some kind of pasta. I'm sure that I won't be disappointed. The staff, Manager and everyone involved with this excellent place have made our dining experiences a pleasure. Try the Pan pizza and I'm sure that you'll love it too."
1,Doesn't appear to really be NC style bbq but that doesn't mean it isn't good!!! \n\nI had ribs and sampled some of my friends brisket. The ribs were pretty tasty while the brisket was a little dry. The sides weren't bad either.\n\nPurists probably aren't in to Queen City Q but I liked my ribs and the beer selection was solid so I can't complain.
1,"Brianna at \""Rouge Skin Hair and Makeup services\"" is awesome!  She did my makeup a few times just for fun and going out and she did such a great job. She is very professional and fun.  She picked the right colors to go with my skin tone, and I got lots of compliments.\n\nI have also seen some of her work done at weddings and it's just amazing.  When my day comes, she will def be the one I call.\n\nThanks Brianna! You rock!"
0,The pizza is ehhhhh.\n\nthe sandwiches sound cool but also ehhh. the bread is something you'd need to get used to.\n\nI don't really know about this place. It's just okay to me as it could definitely have some great potential here but I just don't know what's missing!
0,"Seriously people. There is nothing new here. Electric Daisy Carnival is an annual electronic dance music festival nightmare held multiple times a year in different locations around the world. So basically, you just saw these people 3 months ago playing the same droning monotonous tracks. Over 350,000 will descend upon Las Vegas as if it's the second coming of JC himself. As wonderful as it sounds for our economy, it won't be what you think. These people don't gamble, shop, eat at fine dining establishments, go to shows, etc and so on. The average age is 17 and for the most part they will get drunk and get high and discard that investment in various receptacles across the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. So why Vegas? We already showcase these DJ's week in and week out as we are the number one nightlife destination in the world. Nowhere in the world are DJ's held in higher regard as they are in Vegas. Just look at the numerous billboards, hotel marquees and resort facades. There has got to be somewhere else that needs EDC besides Vegas. I vote for Reno. Or Bakersfield. Yea. Bakersfield is good.... That's far far away....."
0,"So, I have had sushi here quite a bit and have always been very pleased.  This is in comparison to having sushi all over the US and 4 years living in Japan-- I have some say in what good sushi is.  I am sad to say that this place has gone down, nose first.  I would say that they use to have the best Caterpillar roll I have ever had.  Now it is the worst.  Last night we ordered a Caterpillar, Philadelphia, and a Yellow Tail roll.  This had to be the worst sushi I have ever had, hands down.  The fish had no flavor and the fillings were just plain pathetic.  In the Caterpillar roll, which is supposed to have eel, there was almost no eel at all--we could not even see the eel, just a bunch of imitation crab.  This was brought to the attention of our waitress, who by the way is the only reason they are getting 2 stars and not 1 (she was polite, attentive and apologetic), who went to the manager about getting us a new roll.  When she came back we were told that they could make us a new one but it would have the exact same amount of eel in it, unless we wanted to pay for extra eel.  We chose not to have them make us more crap and they were \""kind\"" enough to take it off the bill.  Not once did a manager come over to ask about what was wrong or to apologize.  I felt like they just really did not care about me enjoying their food or service.  As I said before, the waitress that we had was great and really took care of us.  If their sushi was as good as the staff, it would be great.  Sad to say I will be taking my money elsewhere!!!"
1,"I love the food here and the service is always very friendly. I signed up for the text alerts and I get great deals almost weekly. I love the sauce they use because it's obvious there is no MSG and it's low in sugar. Other teriyaki sauces cause my hands to swell and hurt. They also have a low carb, high protein plate and I'm a huge fan :)"
0,"I was SO hoping to love this place; we used to go to Sushi Eye in Motion in Chandler before it closed down and loved THAT one.  But this place just didn't impress us on all fronts.  The regular California rolls were delicious, and our child liked the shrimp tempura. But the specialty rolls were too oily (the deep fried ones -- maybe the oil was not hot enough?) or fishy.  I always get turned off by a sushi place that has fish that actually smells fishy because it's supposed to be very neutral if it's fresh. It was kind of dark inside. Service was quick and the server was nice & polite, but I don't think we'll be back."
0,"Wasn't impressed.  The Brazilian hurt more than a regular Brazilian.  Whatever it is that they use isn't very good for my parts down there...or the tech sucked.  Either way, I won't be going back to this place.  Slow and painful...."
1,"awesome spot. live music on Fridays and Saturdays. We had the petite Shiraz. I had the beef medallions, and the sauce was delectable. My wife had the Alfredo with chicken as they had run out of shrimp ... the entrees are spendy, but their happy hour (3-6) is very fairly priced. the service was great; our server was well-versed oenophile. definitely worth it if you can find it!"
0,"I was surprised to find this was the only place open to eat at 1:30 am on my last visit to Mandalay Bay.  This used to be my hotel and I always thought there were more options.\n\nAnyways, I ended up eating here 2x within 4 hours.  \n\nYou can sit down in the restaurant and have a decent menu available to you or you can order from the counter.  The latter is better, over priced smaller bites.  The former has a wider selection - Vegas strip priced diner food.\n\nI wish there were more options.  But at 4:30 in the morning after being up all night and still wasted, this place ain't bad.  \n\np.s.  the pastries at the counter are good."
0,"I get very frustrated with restaurants that have misguided management practices... With PF Changs, they will make you wait 15 to 20 minutes minimum even if the restaurant is empty.  The management of this mediocre restaurant chain seems to believe by making every guest wait, it ads an air of exclusivity or some sort of scarcity mentality of desirability to their marketing efforts.  They pulled this nonsense on my wife and I today and we walked out, went next door to BJ's and were promptly seated, despite their restaurant being far more busy than P. F. Chang's.  Back when P.F. Changs was briefly the trendy and cool place to go, I enjoyed the food and service, but now that the bloom has worn of the rose and they still try this nonsense of making customers wait, despite available seating, they are just annoying and very trailer-park in atmosphere.  Avoid this restaurant, it is a charade of a business that it once was and does not merit putting up with their silly seating practices."
1,"I am giving 4 starts, because of the girls at the reception. They where really useless, and did not have a clue what they where doing. \nLuckily Matt, the manager, came out to help us out,  and calm us all down (it was 4 of us, plus another unhappy couple)\nBecause of the whole mess at the reception and everyone being really upset, Matt arranged, for all of us, to drive 5 cars(instead of 3 or 4), which was great.\nThe moment we where in the car`s everything went perfectly well. \nThe only bad thing while driving is- do not expect to drive fast.You will drive in line, one after the other one, and most of the time we had to follow  speed signs.\nBut we did manage to go few times fast for a few seconds, which was amazing!\nThere is no overtaking or doing anything crazy, and they are really strict about it, so if you want to drive fast cars really fast- this is not  drive for you!\nGreat experience thanks to Matt and other two instructors that where with us while driving!!"
0,Well I can't really comment on their food or their service.\n\nWe decided to order from them one evening but the guy told us it would take over an hour and he sounded like we were really inconveniencing him. So we told him to forget about it.\n\nI don't mind waiting over an hour but I'd like a little courtesy over the phone.
1,I love the Bellagio.. it sucks they don't have minimum bidding.. but either way Steve did a fantastic job on creating a journey of beautiful italian architecture and real style to his casino.. a must visit or stay at when in Vegas!!!
1,"We decided to drop by on a recent Sunday night.  The place was not busy at all, just a few lone diners at the bar and a couple of other couples scattered about.  First off, I love the decor.  The wood burning brick oven on the lower level surrounded by a small bar for those who want to watch their pizza being made.  Up a half flight of stairs, there is the rich red brick wall behind the massive bar.  Love the rustic light fixtures and the butter yellow covered banquet and chairs and beautiful wood tables.\n\nThe menu has some nice choices of snacks, salads and pizzas.  They also have some interesting seasonal specials.  This place is all about the beverages.  They serve 30 craft beers from local and regional breweries, a list that is forever changing.  They also serve wines by the glass and cocktails.\n\nWe came in to enjoy a pizza and decided to share The Carnivore.  The menu description is as follows:  San Marzano tomatoes, house-made sweet and hot Italian sausage, spicy pepperoni, bacon and  house-made mozzarella.  This pizza doesn't really look like much.  But it was super amazing.  The crust was absolutely perfect.  Just the right amount of chewy goodness.  The Italian sausage is out of this world.  Perfect in every way.  Just the right amount of spicy hotness.  The pepperoni, bacon and cheese were all very good.  Perfectly seasoned, cooked just right.  BJ said it best.  \""Jules, this is the best pizza that I have ever had\"".\n\nWe didn't stop there.  We needed to have dessert.  We shared the cinnamon-almond pizelle cones with vanilla mascarpone, cinnamon apples, and candied walnuts.  It was really good, not overly sweet.  And the perfect dessert for two.\n\nWe look forward to our next visit.  Can't wait to try something from their seasonal menu."
1,get big or go home!!!!! love this gym!!!!
1,"I wanted to write an update based on my recent find. I usually stop in here to look at the decor type stuff, but after a crazy hunt for a dress for my formal work X Mas party I recalled seeing dresses in here before and thought I'd give it a try.\n\nI found the PERFECT dress for the party and it only cost $35! I received numerous compliments on it at the party and felt like the bell of the ball. So aside from my regular great finds, I have to recommend them for formal attire as well. Gosh, I love this place!"
1,"I am a fan of Mexican food, good Mexican food. Few things piss me off more than crap Mexican food that winds up being an insult to the nation and the cuisine. The Round Corner Cantina won me over with their ability to not screw up a good thing. I went there on a Thursday night with a couple of friends (who are my culinary cohorts now that my girlfriend is out of town for the summer) and we were pleased with our selection. The four of us first discovered the RCC when we were placed on a wait for Piccolo Forno, an Italian restaurant of unparalled excellence across the street. As Piccolo is sans bar, we sauntered across the street to RCC for some cocktails while we waited. We were so impressed and pleased we decided to make a return trip. This is the story of that trip.\n\nWhen one walks into the Round Corner, you are immediately transported to a dingy Baja tequila joint. I love the decor inside, it it classic Mexican bar atmosphere. I almost expect Clint Eastwood to stroll through the front door smoking a stogie and wearing a battered old serape. The building is deceptively large; the front bar is small but through an almost hidden hallway, you are led to a larger dining room and then an outdoor patio area. The Patio area looks and feels like a Baja surf bar. I like it, it's relaxed and cool and right up my alley.\n\nIt is easy to tell by the set up of the restaurant and the menu, that Round corner focuses heavily on the bar side of the business. I don't mind this because they do it right. They maintain a large stock of tequilas and mezcals, and here they actually note the difference between the two (no tequila will NEVER have a worm) and their beer selection is populated by mostly Mexican and Carribean lagers. Not the ideal location for a hop head, but on a hot summer night I like those styles, so I was happy with my Red Stripe. Thry also have a coctail menu that is interesting to say the least. Our female friend drank the red sangria and the Something-Star Cocktail and said they were deliscious, but that the sangria was better. For me, I broke up the beer with a Perfect 10, a gin-based play on a mojito. I thought it was quirky and unique, but I switched back to beer (I just don't do fru-fru glassware). One side note, from my prior visit, be careful if you are drinking liquor here. I was ordering single Hendricks' and Tonics and was easily getting doubles and then some.\n\nAs far as the service goes, this is where Round Corner loses as star for me. The service at the bar was quick, effiecient and pleasant, but at the table, things slowed waaaay down. They were busy and I do take that into consideration, but it should not take almost two hours for some chips, tacos, and drinks. Our waitress was nice enough and accomodated all our requests, but she was very slow.\n\nHowever, when the food did come, we forgot all out complaints. We shared orders of the guacamole, slasa verde, and salsa rojo with chips. The chips are hand made there, as were all of the dips. My favorite was the guacamole, but the salsas, while flavorful, were a little runny for my tastes. The runniness also meant that the guys there got salsa all over us. Followed by the chips we got the tacos. I went full-on-fat-boy and got pork belly, hanger steak, and tempura mahi mahi tacos. Coincidentally, that is also the order of my favorites. Starting with the pork belly, if you are not a fan of fat, steer clear. Actually, scratch that, grow a pair, hit the gym later, and get them any way. The pork belly tacos were excellent; succulent and covered in cilantro, onions, and apples. The steak tacos were good as well, but not quite the experience that the pork belly tacos were. The mahi mahi was the biggest dissappointment. The flavor of the fish was just kind of lost amongst the toppings, namely the cabbage. Also, I feel as if the fis tacos provided the least bang for my buck. They are eight dollars, but are really just a couple tortillas, some sauce, and about three ounces of fish. A bit of a rip if you ask me. I usually don't complain about price, but I did feel it was a little pricey here, especially when I can get tacos of a superior quality from Reyna's in the Strip. I guess you could justify it by saying Reyna's tacos are street food and they don't have to pay for the rent and liquor, but I must counter by saying that the ingredients Round Corner uses are very similar to Reyna's and that Round Corner pays for the liquor with the liquor.\n\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Round Corner. The ambiance, quality of food, and bar mean I will be going back at some point, even if I might not be rushing back. I will probably go when I feel like cocktails and decent tacos, but If I am simply on a mission for amazing tacos, Reyna's is still the king in my book. Four Stars"
0,"Went again for a routine oil change - made an appointment.  When I went in for service I had to wait 10 minutes before anyone even looked at me.  Finally sat down to fill out the service order. I cannot understand why they do this by hand each time.  I bought the truck here, why don't you have my information in the computer?  After filling it all out the service rep says \n\n\""it will be ready in about 2 and 1/2 hours\""\n\n\""I had an appointment\"" I replied.  \n\nHe shrugged his shoulders so I left.  Every time I have been to this place for service there has been a gaff."
0,"Meh. \n\nI expected that I would want to give this place 4 stars based on other yelp reviews and some friend recommendations, but no.  \nOur experience wasn't the greatest.  It began around 630 PM trying to find parking.  There's a red curb out front where cars freely park.  Where are the firefighters going to park? It was happy hour and the place was packed (awesome for business). The staff was very friendly and accommodating but we were confused by who was actually our server.  The food was the least impressive.  We tried the meatballs, pork nuggets and the Poutine.  I expected homemade but I'm pretty sure the pork belly was smothered in some jar sauce and the meatballs were previously frozen.  Also, the gravy in the Poutine seemed like it was from a mix. \nThis place has so much potential! The interior is cute with exposed brick.  The little store attached is probably great for the residents nearby.  Fix the food, get the staff on the same page and resolve some parking issues and it would be golden."
0,Bought a can of their coconut water.  Got deathly sick after drinking it.  Contacted Sprouts through their website just to tell them what happened.  No response.  I guess  customers getting sick on their products just doesn't matter.
1,"This has most of the things I want, but sometimes I will go to Lee Lee's to get my favorites."
1,This store has everything you could possibly need for your remodel or project. Prices are much less than other tile stores. Wish I found this place sooner.
0,Tried out this new place today.   Looks good from the outside and the interior/atmosphere was decent.  Service was not all that great and the food was ok.  Not bad but nothing to write home about.   Overall a 2.5/3 on the scale.
0,"Was on a trip with friends for a birthday and I decided to take charge on where we ate a few dinners.  I decided on RM Seafood for one night based on reviews and the reputation of Chef Moonen.  Well, I ended up looking like an ass.\n\nWe went on a Friday night at 8ish and there was only one other table in the whole place, so the atmosphere was horrible and silent with crappy oldies music playing.\n\nFood was good, but very overpriced for what you got....even for Vegas.  I wasn't expecting the bargain of the century going in there, but the prices were very high and the portions very small.  Sushi was very good and had tons of choices.  We had to send back an appetizer for being cold and the 5 different servers (they must serve in teams, either that or there wasn't enough tables for them all so they shared) we had each apologized and said they told the Manager and General Manager....blah blah.  Neither Manager came over to the tabe to apologize (it's not like they were busy) and of course they didn't remove the item from the bill (which I wasn't expceting, but most high-end places would do so).\n\nThe biggest issue was that one of the servers kept making comments on the weight of one member of my party.  Although my friend is a bigger guy, he certainly isn't an obese slob and is NOT the type of guy that any person ever looks at and thinks it's a good idea to mess with.  He is very intimidating.  However, this did not stop one of the servers from making at least 5 seperate comments about my friends size or what he was eating and how much, etc.  I will say that the server seemed to not be doing it to be malicious, I think he was just an idiot.  This server has no idea how close he was to getting knocked out cold for some of his comments.  It was very inappropriate abnd certainly wrecked dinner for my friend.\n\nI cannot recommend.  There are better places in Vegas."
1,"Is every Chipotle the same? Is every prom date the same? NO!\n\nThis location is fantastic. The staff is fast, the food is fresh, and the restaurant is kept clean. \n\nI've never been disappointed. \n\nI'm not going to get into the nuances of what makes for a great meal at Chipotle, because they are quite prominent around town. The menu is simple, and you can pretty much order whatever you want, as long as they have the ingredients.\n\nMy only piece of advice for you is, when you walk in, turn left to get in line. Don't be a jackass like me and turn right. You'll see what I mean when you get there..."
1,"This is our second time here and it is really good. Great pasta dishes. Small menu and small dining area, but pasta sauces have BIG flavor. A very relaxed, small town Italian place with the atmosphere of a New York City hole in the wall,...and that is meant in a good way."
1,"Room 241 this time.  Octagonal room, very comfortable.  Nice."
1,"This is the place to go for tapas in Las Vegas. Not only is it inside Aria which gets you to City Center, but it's done by chef Julian Serrano and is cearly one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. Make this a destination.  I have been a number of times and always love the Tortilla Espanola (which is my own measure of a great Barcelona style tapa wherever I go for tapas). Julian Serrano's does not disappoint, but they have changed the recipe recently and its lost something (different olive oil or less egg?). Same story with the Pan Catalan which is now on a tiny split baguette - clever, but it's less authentic. The choices are many traditional Spanish tapas and a number of newer tapas. You can't go wrong, but absolutely leave space for the churros con chocolate!"
1,"In spite of the Malayan curse and being a victim of an untimely conflagration in it's building, this gem is officially reborn and doing wonderful things once again!  As many of you know, Ranch House re-opened its doors last Monday, and today Peggy and I had the absolute pleasure of having breakfast there. The food is superb, as always, and the service is excellent.  Chicken-fried steak (either with cream gravy or with green pork chili) is wonderfully favorable and not just breading. The burritos are always top notch.  It is a pleasure to welcome back this neighborhood place!"
1,Delicious and fresh food at a reasonable price. The ambiance it wonderful. Very cute and comfortable atmosphere. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new and unique place to eat.
1,"What the %$#@ just happened???  You have to try the \""Mama Spinatos signature fresh spinach pizza!!!   Fresh spinach, tomatoes, and a handful of fresh garlic,  It was like a flavor bomb hit my pie hole!  This pizza is so good you can't put it down 'til your lying fetal position on the couch because you ate so much.  This is chicago thin crust at its finest.  \n\nI eat pizza, its what I do and this place has great thin crust.  Do yourself a favor and order a take-out, trust me.\n\nI wish i could comment on the rest of the food.  The pizza is so good I can't seem to try anything else.\n\nEdit: The pizza here puts Oregano's to shame."
0,"I've never been to the Nobu in NYC. I've heard that it blows Vegas away. However, we went on a Friday and dropped serious coin on average sushi. The fish seemed fresh. The sushi rice was dry. The apps were average. To bright inside to fit a 'hip' feel. Never again."
0,"Very disappointed, my girlfriend and I went into this place to try somewhere new, we were immediately met with a snotty attitude from our waiter (Ben). We were told in a very rude way, it wasn't happy hour after we were looking at the only thing on the table, the happy hour menu. Then when my girlfriend asked a question about which fish is in the seafood chowder, again we were met with the snotty answer \""seafood\"" and then a laugh at her question. Can't rate the food as we walked out. The bread and water wasn't bad though."
0,"Online stock information is not correct and when attempted to call was placed on hold 3 times with no explanation. Poor customer service when in store, not acknowledged by any staff nor asked for help. Shelves messy and poor stock on floor after driving 40 min with incorrect stock information."
1,"Get drinks, they do not pour light which i loved. Get staff and good food. Had a great night with friends at the bar."
1,Perfect little cozy family owned place where you'll not only love the fresh ingredients but appreciate the families story. Be sure to meet them while you're enjoying a hidden local gem in the quaint town of Matthews NC.
1,"We went in on a Sunday morning, it was very busy but we got seated in about 10 minutes. Service and food were both excellent! I ordered and omelette that was cooked perfectly with potatoes and toast. Very large portions but made excellent leftovers. The lemon blueberry pancakes and French toast ordered by my family smelled heavenly as well! All around great place, kind if small so would be difficult for a large party, but I will definitely be heading back!"
1,"WOW, I mean wow. This place has great customer service, excellent food and at a good price. Very romantic as well and somewhere I would recommend taking a date with your significant other or even for a first date with someone new."
0,"I placed the order on this place las night, through GrubHub.I had a Philly Steak pizza and a Philly Steak paninni with a side of coleslaw!\nFirst of all, it took around one hour, one hour and 15 minutes for the meal to come, but that's not such a big issue with me since I'm a patient guy!\nThe paninni I would say was quite good, but the coleslaw was very-very dry!And still that's not the biggest issue!The pizza tasted quite good also, my issue with it is the size of the actual pizza!It was a 18\"" but in the photo of it you can clearly see where the toppings are starting to be spread!So, I paid for a 18\"" and I actually got a 16\"" or less pizza!\nDefinitely I won't order nothing from this guys anymore! So, future customers, beware!"
1,i love this place!!!!!!!
1,"Lantz was our DJ and he did a great job at our wedding reception! He kept the party going and followed our schedule even as we changed it around during the course of the night. My only concern up until the wedding was that I hadn't met my DJ in person since I lived far away, and I wasn't sure which DJ I was getting until the event was 3 weeks away. But everything turned out great! I'm happy I went with All Night Long. They also set up very nice LED up-lighting that really made our venue room look beautiful."
0,"The facilities are beautiful but this place is POORLY run.\nWe stayed here for a wedding and they lost the bride and groom's reservation not once, but twice!\nThe father of the bride was also given keys to a room that was already occupied. He discovered this little mistake when he walked into a room with undergarments thrown all over the place. \nThe most irritating aspect is they did nothing make up for all the mistakes."
1,"This was my first time in Vegas and I have to admit, I blew most of my cash almost immediately.  I started break-dancing for money.  I couldn't afford the 25 cent slot machines.  I was in a rut.\n\nBut I looked up one day and said, \""Hey self. I'm on vacation. Let's go to a buffet.\""  So I chose the Wynn.  Good choice.\n\nFirst of all, they have anything you could ever think of.  Ok, MOSTLY anything you could ever think of, but the selection is crazy.  They have different sections for Italian, Asian, Breakfast, Seafood, Shellfish, Salad...you name it.  I was a fan of the hand-rolled sushi and the hush puppies and southern food.  All very good.\n\nThe only thing I was disappointed about was that most sites advertised king crab legs and alas, no crab legs.  I had also heard a rumor that they open the crab legs for you so I was doubly disappointed that there weren't even any crab legs for them to open for me. \n\nI was also under the impression that it would be around $17 and it was closer to $25 for lunch.  That was a surprise, but perhaps I didn't pay close enough attention.  $17 would have been a better price.  But all in all it was a tasty buffet!"
1,"My fave Mexican Restaurant in AZ, love the cheese crisps :)"
0,"I originally gave a very good review for Chinita. The last two times we have gone the service was pretty bad.   My husband had to walk up to the bar to engage our waiter who was chatting with the bartender.  We had waited for over 15 minutes for him to see if we needed anything. We were the ONLY customers in the restaurant so it was not as if they were slammed.  I am pretty sad about this because it is so nearby and we really wanted to continue going.  Both times it has been the same waiter.  And no, it is not because we don't tip well.   Our son is a bartender and was a server.   We are generous tippers, we don't ask for anything changed in what we order.  It just seems that the initial aim to please has passed."
1,"I went to have a drink here for a friends birthday. It was nice, I liked the atmosphere and the waiter was attentive. I felt bad because it was a very large group but I think the staff did a great job getting everything out to us. They even split the bill 100 different ways! My drink was good, can't wait to try the food!"
1,"Hooray (local) beer! It great to see Charlotte finally coming into its own in the craft beer scene, and we have some amazing neighborhood brews to choose from, with NoDa being the top of my list.\n\nMost importantly, the beer is good. Very good. As a former professional lush whose craft and import beer samplings number in the hundreds, I can safely attest that NoDa is becoming one of my favorites. The red is refreshing with just enough bite, Coco Loco is everything a dark beer should be, and the summer offering, Nodajito, I can't get enough of. If the city would let me, I'd prefer my house water supply be sourced from the brewery instead.\n\nSpeaking of, what a cool place to hang out! Plenty of room inside, even when it's crowded, with lots of funky art on the walls. I've never been by when the picnic tables outside haven't been full and there is always a game of cornhole being played. You can usually find Maki Taco or Autoburger parked out front for your fooding delights, too. The staff is friendly and fun, rounding out the experience.\n\nI'm incredibly glad NoDa Brewing is here and hope to see them stay for quite a while."
0,"Took my buddy here to sober him up.  Food was way over priced.  Way better places to eat on the strip.  Save your money for the bars, strip clubs and the poker tables."
1,"You haven't really been to Vegas until you've see one of those shows where the girls are topless and wearing giant feathery headdresses.  It's classic Vegas at its best.  It's not like any of the Cirque shows.  It's good old fashion singing, dancing, and fully choreographed numbers.  Splashy costumes, chorus lines, it's all there.\n\nIt's a fun show.  They offer a 'kid-friendly' version earlier in the evenings.  I don't remember, but I think there is a two drink minimum.  It's classic Vegas in all its feather and rhinestones glory."
1,"I can't say enough about how AMAZING this place is.  My children are 11 and 7.  My 11 year old is not very talented in sports, especially team sports, but I wanted him to be active.  He was also having a difficult time in school socially and I wanted to find something to build up his self-confidence.  Master Joe has a fabulous demeanor and the kids respond beautifully to him.  He know EVERY SINGLE CHILD in his classes, no matter how many attend, and he calls each one of them by their name.   He and his team of Black Belt helpers work with the kids to develop proper techniques and form.  The kids advance according to their skill level, but no child is left behind.  Master Joe even took time to go to my son's school classroom to expose the children to TaeKwon Do.  It was an excellent experience for my son as he used him to demonstrate techniques to the class.  I could tell my boy felt amazing after that session.  This is a family run business, and Kate, Joe's wife and partner works with each family to determine which classes and events will spark your child's interest.   This is an incredibly positive place that I feel blessed to have found.  Master Joe continually teaches respect, focus and control...what child doesn't need to learn some of that???"
0,Boring and bland. Slow service. You'd be better off going to Pastamore in the March\u00e9.
1,The staff is always kind. The beer is always creative and their events are top notch. They seem to always be ahead of the curve. NoDa Brewery sets the bar. Perfect brewery for the trendy neighborhood the reisde in. Beer is delicious and check out the taproom.
0,"Came home from a weekend stay at MGM and had been biten by something all over my ankles and legs.  the only time I was not wearing shoes, socks and pants was when I was sleeping in the bed.  I suspected bed bugs and called the hotel to express my concern.  Instead, I was passed around to four different people with 3 minutes of hold tme in between.  Finally, the 4th person took my name and number and said some one would call me back.  Well, you know how that goes...No one ever called back.  I called the Nevada Health Department to investigate.  The sad reality is that the hotel only cares about the bottom line profit.  I don't know if there is a problem or not, but the hotel doesn't care."
1,"Very good pastries, service was not bad either. Not sure why there are so many complaints on their service, it's a bakery, I barely need to talk to anyone through the whole process. \n\nI took off one star because even though everything tastes amazing, their cakes look pretty meh. There are so many asian bakeries with much cuter cakes, they need to be inspired a little more."
1,UPDATE! Apparently are now staying open! Yay! Looking for a new gym was depressing me!\n\n---------------------------\nI just got word that Tangible Tanning & Fitness is closing down the fitness center at the end of February... (Tanning salon remain open) \n\nSo depressed. Finding a comparable gym will not be easy or fun!\n\nSad to see you go!
0,"First time staying in Vegas for my wedding and we opted for the Luxor because I really liked their wedding packages.  This review is about the hotel itself; I'll do a separate review for the chapel.\nFrom the minute you walk in you're bombarded by people offering you free show tickets and a $50 voucher if you go to a timeshare presentation.  DO NOT DO IT!  We actually did sign up for it, because it sounded like a good deal and they said it would only take 2 hours.  Friends of ours got suckered into it on a previous stay and ended up being stuck at this presentation for over 4, so we skipped it.  The entire weekend we were there though people constantly harass you to sign up for this.  Even when the photographer was taking pictures of us after the ceremony in the hotel, when we walked past they were still throwing pitches towards us!  WTF?!\nFront desk check-in wasn't too slow and they were nice and friendly.  I had the same complaint as everyone else...the a/c in the room sucks.  It's a box unit and only blows in one direction.  It's right by the large window too, so I'm sure a lot of air gets sucked out that way.  The room also needed some updating and repairs.  The wardrobe was really badly scuffed or chipped.  I thought the bathroom was fairly nice and looked like it had been redone recently.  The beds were pretty comfortable and housekeeping did a good job.\nHowever, the bell desk was pretty unfriendly and seemed annoyed that we were even bothering them.  I was also charged twice for having my dress pressed, and was told it will take 10 days for them to investigate the charges.  The weird thing is they charged one day and the other charge was two days later.\nHad breakfast at MORE and it was just ok.  Pyramid Cafe was actually way better and cheaper; I just don't get my money's worth at buffets unless it's got seafood.\nCathouse was a meatmarket.  LAX was just wholly pretentious without even being a good club.  Pretty lame all around.\nSo overall Luxor was just ok to stay in.  We did get a good deal on it, which we got to share with our wedding guests.  Now I know why.  If I ever return to Vegas I'll definitely find somewhere else to stay."
0,"The Quad should be demolished--not \""under renovation\"" for who knows how long. I would call it an apocalyptic ward, not a hotel. It a disgrace to the strip and should not neighbor the new Linq. To start, the front desk agents are like withdrawn zombies banging on computer keys who probably don't talk or smile because they don't even know where to begin on explaining why their computers are always down, why you have to wait in line for an hour, why management can't be found, why the elevators are broken, why all the rooms are disgusting so there's no point in requesting a new one and waiting in line again, and so on. So instead they stare off into space at the front desk; or they zombie walk their way into vacant rooms to eat.. er *clean*.. the blood off the curtains when they're short on housekeeping staff. Maybe the renovation is actually a ploy where the CEOs and zombies are working together to trap drunk gamblers in the destitute maze they call the Quad. There's bizarre signs to confuse you, loose carpet to be tripped on, wobbly escalators to fall on, ancient elevators to get stuck on, and noisy construction to drown out your cries for help when the zombies take over. All sarcasm aside, it's still kind of a scary place. And if you do need to call for help, good luck with the bad cell service. At least you paid the ridiculous wi-fi fee, so you can email your friends and family and warn them about this place!"
1,"No funny business - Caf\u00e9 Berlin is AMAZING. The food is phenomenal, especially their Fried Potatoes (they are a must-have). They have quiet the selection of beer as well - we all know Germans love their beer. Next time I take a trip to Vegas I will make sure that Caf\u00e9 Berlin is on my list. The best thing is that we went there with a group of 30 people and we were able to pay with BITCOIN. \n\nI recommend that everyone tries this place atleast once, but I guarantee you that you will be back for 2nd's. \n\nTo the staff: YOU ALL ARE AWESOME!"
0,"If it were possible to give 0 stars, this place would get it. \nFirst, we ordered dim sum but they were out. The restaurant has dim sum in the name... \nWell, okay fine. We then tried to order potstickers - nope, completely out of all appetizers. \nThen we order our food. Each dish comes out 10-15 minutes apart, which is fine... except for the rice which by the time we got it I was full. \nThe last dish we ordered never even arrived. \nWe asked 3 times for soy sauce and never received it. And the soup needed it. \nFinally, when we asked to see the manager he argued with us, saying the dishes coming out at different times is a Chinese custom. Okay... Really you're going to argue though? \nWe declined the final steak dish as we were done eating by this point and they made a huge show of \""we'll pay for the steak for you.\"" Maybe if you had brought it out ever we would have wanted it. \nAll in all, it was a very uncomfortable experience and I couldn't wait to get out of there."
0,"I can overcome the hipster sneer and accept that I am an uncool blemish in a world full of cut-off corduroys and patterned leggings. What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking 5 years of meatless eating because of an order mishap.\n\nI ordered the red pepper tomato quiche. After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven, I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter. When I dug in for the first bite, a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche. I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche, and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served, because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit,  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send, \""well we don't have anymore of that one.\""\n\nThanks. I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche. She did give me my money back, but no one apologized or offered me any recompense. I'm over you being cooler than me, but I'm not over you having no soul."
1,"Off all the half marathons I've run in the rock 'n roll series, this is my favorite. It's the fastest course, has the best staff and I didn't have to run almost two miles to the start (looking at you, Seattle).\n\nI'm fairly sure this is the largest half marathon in the country and just about everyone shows up, which includes the overweight people (okay, women) who seem to think they can power-walk 13.1 miles in under two hours. Ladies, get the hell out of the way. All you're doing is pissing off the people in the front corrals.\n\nPersonal fitness level and time aside, I enjoy this one. I'm careful to check out what streets are closed when I go down and always end up parking about a mile from the starting line somewhere between Roosevelt and Fillmore for the most hassle-free spot. \n\nIf you ride the light rail back from the finish line in Tempe, it's worth it to walk to the University/Rural Road stop instead of waiting with the masses at the transit center. Actually nevermind I said that."
0,"The only reason for the 2 stars versus 3 stars is the pricing.  Yes, it is Vegas.  Yes, it is the Strip.  Yes, it is the oh-so-trendy Cosmopolitan. \n\nBut, sheesh...it's Chinese and Mexican food.  $5.50 each for a teeny-tiny appetizer tacos(albeit with gourmet filling and hand-made tortillas - the corn for the masa was hand-picked one at a time by specially trained Capuchin monkeys!)...I think we paid $10 for a grilled eggplant (yes, that's singular eggplant).  The food was good, but not extraordinary.  \n\nRecommendation:  If you just made a killing on the casino floor and have a Benjamin to burn, do come here.  Otherwise, it's quite ordinary.  For a couple of retirees like us, it's just too expensive and too 'hip'....of course, our son came here with friends and raved about it.  I guess it's a generation thing!"
1,"Yup, I'm loving it. I've officially been a member for 1 month and couldn't be happier. It's always clean, the staff is pretty down to earth and friendly and I always seem to get the machine I want. While there are no classes, PF supports a no frills policy that seems to speak to all types of folks who, really just want to work out, get healthy, and make positive life choices. Yesterday, while running on a treadmill, I was sandwiched between a 60+ year old fella in Captian Ahab fashion and a woman with sparkly green eyeshadow and a green Christmas tree sweatshirt. In front of me was a cute 20 something gal in a UCLA sweats. Yeah, PF is the epitome of diverse and I absolutely dig it.\n\nThe tanning \""beds\"" are the stand up kind, which I personally dislike because of the claustrophobic factor. In my opinion, skip them. BUT it's only 19.99 a month for the membership plus tanning, which you can't beat!!"
0,"Really disappointed with my stay, but I guess it wasn't really a big deal because all I did in the hotel room was sleep and rest... sooo... with that said..\nThe \""Hollywood hip room\"" (two queens) was seriously lacking everything:\n- not enough lighting... so dim.\n- the room was either too freakin cold or too freakin hot!! I always woke up in the middle of the night freezing or burning up...\n- we didn't get any duvet covers?!\n- no mini fridge??\n- no ice bucket?\n- annoying to use the bathroom because the shower wasn't in a separate room from the sink... especially if you're sharing a room with others.\n- poorly designed, as my friends constantly hit their head against the glass-framed pictures/random wall that stick out from the bed... \n\nOther than that, everything else was okay. The hotel itself was nice... it gets confusing walking around inside, since the place is really flashy. Also a great location with easy access to nearby hotels and Earl of Sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas)!... but if you plan on clubbing a lot, I'd recommend else where because we had to cab it to xs, lax, etc., since they were pretty far (or at least too far in heels). But the theme was really cool since each room had different actors and such and the walls had handprints of celebrities.\n\nOh yes. and guys will have a fun time in the casino. A lot of eyecandy/distraction for them boys. We almost lost a friend because he stopped and got sidetracked when we were trekking our way back to the hotel room."
1,"Beautiful hotel.\n\n- great customer service before, during, and after my weekend stay\n- rialto suite with foyer was very spacious\n- food court with affordable options\n- fine dining available\n- small convenient shops for basic toiletries and snacks\n- housekeeping great with providing extra towels, blankets, and slippers\n- need to present room key card to use hotel elevator banks\n- \""free\"" wifi (included in your resort fees)"
1,"The \""Fish and shrimp Ensenada style\"" plate is amazing and the fish and chips are simple and perfect. \nWhenever I am here it is pretty empty for some reason, but the waitress is very nice and quick, I think more people need to stop in!"
1,"A must visit when visiting Vegas with the kiddies. Worth the ticket price $18 for adults and $12 for kids ( some of the money goes to a good cause, pretty cool!). My kids have been to Sea World SD tons of times and I thought maybe this would a bit boring since it is much much smaller. I was wrong, they really enjoyed all the exhibits and spent a good amount of time petting the stingrays."
0,"Stayed here for a night for a convention. For that the location couldn't be better. The bed was comfortable too. That's why I gave a second star. I reserved two nights but left a day early to spend Father's Day with my newborn son and they refused to refund the second day even though I checked out before 10am. They have no parking and will not validate so guests pay $12 per day. If you take the little $5 Aquafina bottle in the room, walk to a 7-11 later and buy one for $1 and replace it in the room before checkout. Don't even bother with the pool or hot tub here. There is no free Wi-Fi. That will cost you another $10 per day or $15 if you want premium. Was glad to check out. Not what I expected from Hyatt. Nothing against the nice ladies at the desk, but I was much more welcome when I got home! :)"
1,"Remember the famous movie \""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle\""? Well my dear friends embarked on a journey to Earl of Sandwich. \n\nWas it worth it?? Yup, The Caribbean Jerk Chicken was my favorite. The swiss cheese and bell peppers gave it the perfect \""party in your mouth\"". The bread is toasted to perfection. Must def try."
1,"I don't go to Ramen Bar very often because my very own, what I thought was original, (delicious!) miso broth recipe tastes identical to their miso broth, but it's a great spot for a comforting bowl of soup. The ramen is not vegan, but they have rice noodles they can substitute. And they have and use TONS of veggies, which is how they sometimes win over my home version. A little pricy, but they don't skimp on ingredients."
1,"I've eaten here a few times and it's been great every time. My favorite has to be the Crispy Philly though, which is a classic Philly Cheesesteak wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried, really good with a little bit of the secret sauce as well. Also had the strawberry lemonade which was excellent."
1,I've been to Jason's deli twice and its become one of my favorite places to eat for lunch. My personal favorite is the Sante Fe Chicken sandwich; I love the guacamole mixed with the bacon and chicken breast. I also like how they have complimentary soft serve ice cream as well.
0,"My wife and I went to Envy for my Birthday Dinner with great expectations but left disappointed.\n\nWe started with a completely flavorless onion soup and a so-so spinach salad. Skipped the appetizers and had the 'signature' bone in rib eye that again was completely flavorless. It was cooked a perfect medium but there was no flavor, no great tenderness, nothing that stood out. I had it topped Oscar style which was nice and added the only flair.\n\nMy wife had the Sea Bass which was served over wild mushrooms and topped with Crab Victoria. The fish was perfect as were the mushrooms. The crab was seasoned with Thyme and Rosemary which was just awful and took away from the fish. She added the butter poached king crab which again was seasoned, this time with parsley which again took away from the clean flavor the the crab and while I have had butter poached lobster before, the crab did not taste like anything had been done other than boiling. \n\nThe only high point were the sides. We shared the Creamed corn and the bacon and Gruy\u00e8re mashed potatoes. Both were perfect.\n\nService was very good as well but we will not be making a return trip."
1,"Sugar crusted brioche buns were DELICIOUS and they have macaroons in large and mini sizes. This was my first time eating a macaroon. I selected the caramel flavored one after being told it was the ''original'' -- so I was easily convinced.  It was yummy but I'm not a fan of creme or frosting inside. I definitely want to try their croissants. They had other pastries items that looked divine. \n\nIt looks like a nice brunch/lunch spot with tables and waittresses, but I just bought my goodies to-go. They have lattes and other beverage options. I ordered an iced coffee that was just okay. \n\nThe place was packed and busy even at 11am with limited parking. That's a sure sign, this is the place to be!"
1,One of my fab theaters make sure to get the cup and shirt to save some money if you go to the movies regularly
1,"We go here at least once a week.\nIt's always crowded but timing is everything..we try to get there with the busy time has died down a bit.\nAlways clean, and always great service."
1,"At least 4.5 stars. Let me start by staying that I thought this was a great place. The ambiance was fantastic and maybe I enjoyed myself so much because we went here with a group of 18 or so right after my husband and I got married in the Venetian but here's the breakdown. \n\nThe appitizers were really great, the parmesan chips were thin and had wonderful flavor. We talked about stealing a basket as we left. The bbq shrimp was done perfectly and a great twist. \n\nMy brother had the soft shell crab and that may have been my favorite thing I had. It was fantastic but I don't have much comparison since that was actually the first time I've had soft shell crab. Nevertheless, it had great flavor and I would order it again. My husband and I split a steak and got the cesear salad. The salad was really nice and fresh. The steak was great, and probably in the top 3 I have ever had. \n\nWe had a bunch of wine and tried a few different kinds and they were all great. The manager came over and talked to us about the wines and was very informative and nice. \n\nThe reason why this didn't get 5 stars from me was because for the price, you just expect a little more from the steaks. This was still one of the best dinners I have ever had and I would absolutely go back."
1,Fast service and great Ice cream. The waffle cone was different that I'm used to. It is good just very crumbly. I really enjoyed it and there was a chocolate surprise in the bottom of the cone.
0,"Went there tonight for the Grand Opening hoping to catch Authority Zero for my last night in town. Paid 45 bucks for 3 tickets (fair price) waited in line 45 minutes ( my fault for showing up late) and left after being inside for 5 minutes. The first minute was adjusting to the smell of B.O. and funk that slams you in the face followed by the stifling heat and humidity combination, and lastly the floor seemed to be collecting pools of water every few feet in any direction. If I hear some upgrades are made I might give it another try, otherwise no thanks. Next time take an extra week and spend some money on a proper cooling system and get some ventilation."
1,"Visited Lo Lo's for lunch last week and absolutely loved it. We don't have a soul food/southern spot near us so we definitely had high hopes for our stop here. The service was perfect, polite & quick. \nEverything extra requested was responded with a \""no problem\"" and a smile. I in no way was looking forward to the waffle, not knowing any better, but I was surprised about how good it was, especially with the fried chicken! Every trip here in the future I won't be passing them up. Our food was so good that we finished every last bite!\n(Use the complimentary valet since parking in the neighborhood is practically impossible.)"
0,I would normally give this restaurant 4-stars but the service that me and my friend reviewed was not the greatest. She was just chit chatting for about 10 minutes with a coworker while we were waiting for our checks. The wings were very good though.
0,"Not great service, not great rooms.  Crowded, loud...wouldn't recommend."
1,"My experience with Jeremy and his team was outstanding, especially given that they are in Arizona and I'm in Georgia. Here is the email I sent them just hours after closing on our home to express my gratitude: \n\n\""Jeremy, Tonia and Alexa, I just want to say thank you SO much for all the hard work you each did to get us where we are today: CLOSED!! The closing went off super smoothly. In fact, the attorney and both real estate agents commented on how rare it is for that to happen today, ESPECIALLY where all the funds are in hand, including the lender funds. I know this is a direct result of the mounds of work and attention to detail that each of you gave to the transaction in advance. And from a communication standpoint, no one can hold a candle to you folks. As a project manager whose job it is to do that and do it well every day, I take my hats off to you. As a buyer it took away so much of the anxiety I could have experienced. Thanks again. YOU. GUYS. ROCK. I'm off to nest now in my new home...\""\n\nI was so impressed with them that I can't wait to find the next person who needs a good mortgage lender so I can say \""Oooh, ooh!! Do I have a loan officer for you!\"". Don't walk, run to your phone to get in touch with Jeremy. It will pay off big time."
1,i love this place. there's so much i want to try (like the suicide squeeze pictured up there)...but i always seem to stick to the first thing i ever ordered and love...the razzle dazzle.
1,"It is not often that I give a BBQ restaurant five stars. I found the food to be very, very good. If this place was in KC or some other BBQ city, I'm not sure that I would give it five stars...Maybe I would. The meat (ribs, chicken, brisket, & pulled pork) was succulent, mouthwatering, flavorful, tender...I could go on and on. You get the picture. The sides (beans, mac & cheese, greens) were cooked perfectly with a southern flare. The sweet tea was oh so yummy. I didn't have a dessert, but I will next time. The service was fast and with a smile. The only thing that bothered me was the place was very smokey (the smell). It was a good thing, but it lingered in my clothes after I left. To most people, I think that is a good thing. To me, it's just one of those things that I perseverate on. LOL...I can't wait to go back."
0,Terrible customer service. Was denied the option to return items out of return window that was easily taken back and reimbursed at an alternate location. Was not allowed to talk to a manager when requested.  Disappointed this represents the LOFTs brand.
0,"Service - prompt. very prompt. In fact so prompt that I called her a \""fly by waitress\"" I didn't even remember what her face looked like. It felt like she wanted us out of there and it was confirmed when at the end of our meal she dropped the bill  without even asking for the previously mentioned to go order we wanted to place. So much for that, our tab could of been higher! It sucks for her because we are like the best customers EVER, we tip great and are super easy, so very put off by this and said to everyone at the table, \""tip going down.\"" Even though we still tip 20% which is a low tip for all of us.\n\nBut my foodie friends and I agreed that every time we have come here the service has lagged. Beautiful space though, which is why we always hope for success.\n\nI am steadily unimpressed by the food. I have had dinner here and this was my first time having Sunday brunch. The best part of it was my amazing cinnamon roll.The orange juice was great, but it was a tiny glass and they put ice in it, WTF?! If I'm paying for fresh squeezed orange juice, on top of a small glass please leave out the ice!\n\nI had the fried egg sandwich. Nice presentation, great tasting sandwich. Came with a side of potatoes, btw, I could live in a potato and eat my way out so I am sad, they look great but are tasteless, so tasteless I didn't even finish them. That's a first!\n\nOn top of everything, waited almost an hour for our food. \n\nSo, since I'm steadily unimpressed by this beautiful spot, I will go back, but only for drinks, they can't mess that up!"
0,"Just needed a heel cap replacement for a 1500 dollar pair of Lucchese cowboy boots, simple job, right?  Tried to converse with the guy at the front desk, but he seemed distracted and uninterested in my comments. As I looked the shop over, another guy was in the back doing the work, but he wasn't listening, just nailing away.\n\nThese handmade boots were specifically designed to look \""distressed,\"" and I wanted them to stay that way, i.e., as originally designed and intended; so I told him, more than once, \""no polish!\"" whatsoever on the heel or around the sole area or anywhere. Just replace the heel cap. The guy said \""no problem!\""  \n\nWell, you guessed it; I went in a week later to pick up the boots, and although the heel cap was itself pretty nice, the heel and sole areas had some thick, cheap looking brown polish slathered all over them, against my instructions, making these handmade boots look disgusting!  I was just in shock and very disappointed.  They are arrogant and can't follow instructions.  And why should they, they're expert repairmen, right?  But they have no taste, no fashion sense, and don't care to take instructions.\n\nIf I could, I'd give negative stars . . ."
0,"Only went to this place because of the Groupon. Service was okay. Food was alright. Didn't try any alcohol drinks. Won't be going back.\n\nHouse salsa - Not great. Like marinara meets salsa. Appealing because it's almost there, but disappointing overall.\n\nQueso - Disgusting. Was more like cheese dip for pretzels.\n\nCarne asada tacos - Pretty good. I got the corn tortillas and would have preferred two per taco in order to avoid them breaking and spilling. Also, limes would be nice. Overall, flavor was great, but was more like a cross between machaca and carne asada.\n\nBeans and rice - They were alright. Nothing special.\n\nFish Tacos - Not good. Fish was extremely dry. There was a tastey sauce, but not enough to fully enjoy it with the other flavors. Again, no limes.\n\nIced tea was great :)"
1,This is the best free attraction they have in Las Vegas!
1,"There are some places you just want to keep to yourself. Tarbell's Tavern is my hot bath, favorite jammies, great glass of wine, crawl into bed, fire burning, book reading, tummy super happy deliciously full ~ kind of place. I'm not even going to discuss the amazing plates because it's Mark Tarbell. Upscale pub. Excellent music, perfect acoustics for the music and hearing the person next to or across from you. The bartender turned me on to a delicious way to finish off my oysters. It' s hard to stump me on the oyster front. Yet, he did. I never would have picked that liquid accompaniment. I could tell you. But, they can deliver it. I am so lucky this is in my neighborhood. But, I would drive, bike, or pogo there anytime if it's wasn't. Thank you Mark for this amazing little gem and the attention to such fine details. except the pens...wood grain would be amazing with the block. Just saying...Cheers!"
0,"This review is strictly regarding customer service and specifically about one representative at this specific location. \n\nI took my 2012 E350 to this location back in April, 2014 to replace the cracked windshield.  I visited on a Saturday, and the two gentlemen there were very helpful.  I had intentionally wanted to pay out of pocket, but the gentlemen suggested that I file a claim and helped me with the claim on site.  They were professional and courtesy and genuinely were happy to be there to do their job. \n\nI returned today due to another crack that requires another replacement.  I am pretty sure it was not the integrity of the windshield since the windshield had to be special ordered from the dealer.  I arrived well before my appointment, and the office was not busy at all.  Teresa was behind the front desk, and she looked confused as I explained to her that I am here for my appointment.  She found my paperwork and continued to look confused.  I explained to her that I am here for an inspection to see rather the crack qualifies for a warranty-repair or a replacement.  She reluctantly got up from her seat and returned with another gentleman.  The gentleman was very helpful and explained to me that a replacement is required.  I went back inside and explained to Teresa what the gentleman told me and asked if she could file a claim for me since my insurance information was previously given during my visit in April.  She was rude with her response and did not seem like she wanted to help me file a claim at all.  She gave me several dirty looks before  I politely asked again if she would call and file a claim while I am there with her.  She finally called and was placed on hold. \n\nIn the meantime, I asked if she would need to order the windshield since it was special ordered from the dealer last time.  (I thought it was a very legitimate question to ask as I would schedule my appointment with Safelite accordingly.)  She gave me yet another dirty look and said that she would have to check and continued to look displeased by simply sitting there.  By this time, I realized I could be paying the Mercedes dealer the same deductible and receive MUCH BETTER customer service than I am getting with Teresa.  \n\nI am sorry, Safelite, I would have happily returned as a happy patron, but due to your ONE representative who cannot do what she is hired to do, I will not recommend this business."
1,"AMAZING! I'm in Madison for just a few days and this place was highly recommended for everything and it didn't disappoint. Being a SF native currently living in NYC, I was shocked at how affordable everything is! Definitely get your $'s worth here. \n\nWe started with 4 snits. The number of craft beers on tap is a bit overwhelming but the snits (flights of 3 oz samples) is pretty perfect for being able to try lots of things. The chocolate stout was great as were some of the red ales and lagers. Snits come in orders of 4,8,12 and they are only $1 for each.\n\nWe then shared a plate of cheese curds...seriously the best thing ever and by far the best curds I've ever had. The Tiger Blue dipping sauce will change.your.life. If you do one thing in Madison, go to Old Fashioned and eat cheese curds.\n\nI had the spicy burger and it was divine! Among the top 5 burgers I've ever had in my life. There's pepper jack cheese and jalapenos on the burger but it's not overly adorned. The meat is grass-fed and juicy...cooked perfectly. \n\nI had a bite of a friend's apple pie to end the meal and will definitely eat here again before we leave (we have 3 more days here). \n\nOne thing I was impressed by is how much of a loco-vore town Madison is. It doesn't come off as pretentious either but it's just a matter of fact that the restaurants here take their food seriously and everything from the eggs to the beef to the cheese are local/organic/free range/grass-fed. The quality makes a huge difference (Old Fashioned even makes their own ice cream!).\n\n5 Stars!!!!"
1,"I've read many of the reviews. Any reviewer that said anything less than a fabulous dining experience is 100% erroneous. This restaurant is delightful. The service was excellent. Anyone who stated the staff was overly attentive- has obviously never been to a fine dining restaurant. The servers are all very knowledge, helpful, and friendly. The specials provided during last night's service were amazing. I wish I could have ordered them all. I was fortunate to arrive at 5pm and all the tables around me ordered about the same time so I could observe the entrees and hear the reviews.\n\nThe Kobe beef steak had to be well over 1lb. It looked amazing and the gentleman that eat it stated as much. His wife has the veal osso buco, although I was a bit dubious to order this here- she loved it. I never saw such large pieces of veal shanks. She loved it and said she would eat it over the next three days. The portions were huge.\n\nMy husband and I had the grilled calamari stuffed with prosciutto. It was amazing. Perfectly cooked, seasoned, and complemented the house bread well. \n\nI ordered the Sangria. Typically, I prefer making my own as I enjoy a nice peach mint white Sangria. However, after reading the reviews on here I trusted my fellow positive food critics that enjoyed this place. I was not let down! It was not overly dry, as many others I have tried at other establishments in the past were. I even tend to enjoy most dry wines but for whatever reason never liked the red Sangria until I drank theirs. Hints of fruit were light and appropriate. Also, the liqueur blended in, likely Brandy, was not obtuse by any means.  Just subtle and lovely. \n\n\nThen came the  house salad with a nice, spicy dressing. Something that reminds me of a French blend. Not my favorite, but the lovely mixture of greens, fresh herbs, and hearts of palm made me forget that I was n otin love with the dressing.\n\nAs i was craving fresh seafood, I splurged on the crab stuffed twin whole lobsters. Amazing. The lobster was cooked perfectly, the crab stuffing was lightly blended with cream and hints of cheese. The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned-mixed with peas and carrots. Equally well, were the broccoli rabe and vegetable melody.\n\nMy husband ordered the grilled sea scallops in brandy. The scallops had a perfect sear to them, and the brandy sauce was not over powering. It was an excellent marriage. He loved this so much he has requested I make this sauce at home. I will try to do that this week =)\n\nCompliments of the house, provided an almond after dinner liqueur-the name sadly has escaped me. Nevertheless, it was a perfect ending to a wonderful meal. I am not even a big fan of after dinner liqueurs, a bit too high in the calories. However, I don't care I will be ordering that again the next time we go!\n\nAs far as the prices, I think they are equivalent to any other fine dining establishment in the area. In fact, I think it is actually more than fair given the excellent service, free parking, and insane abundance of food. I will likely be dinning here at LEAST once a month."
1,"We took the kiddoes for a ride uptown on the train today.  We parked here and startred our journey.  Parking deck was fine, easily accesible and free. \n\nWe walked up the stairs and found a lot of trash including some feminine hygiene products that left me wondering if they were applied while climbing up the stairs.  Gross.\n\nPurchasing a ticket at one of the 2 ticket vending machines was easy enough and self explanatory.  The train was waiting on us and it took about 5 minutes for it to start rolling.\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience."
0,"Customer service at this location is a joke as well as there stock. I was working a huge event in town and the makeup team needed some extra supplies that they normally get from their local Sally's. This particular store was out of almost everything We needed. That was the least of my issues with this place as the sales associate working that day seemed so annoyed and acted like she was being extremely inconvenienced with any questions I had for her, even though there wasn't a single other client in the store. When asking where something was I would literally get an eye roll and a response like \""I don't know somewhere over there\"" followed by a huge sigh. When paying she was again nothing more that rude. If I wasn't in such a hurry and focused on the task i think I would have probably ended up sharing words with this woman that wouldn't have been so nice."
0,"Pool is nice enough but seating is limited. Also they are going the \""young hip\"" way here with the topless area being a club type place instead of just a seperate area like in the past or like Wynn.\nAlso 24.00 for a mixed drink., really 24.00 why people WHY do you put up with this and pay these insane prices. That same drink was 6.00 in 1997. What has changed? The casinos started pushing the limits to see what they could get away with and the people kept paying so they kept pushing. When will it end? A 52.00 jack and coke???"
0,"I tried this gym 6 weeks before my existing membership to a different gym was expiring. The manager quoted me a range of monthly rates from $30-$39 per month. I told her I'd be back when in 6 weeks. When I came back, she quoted me a range from $35-$42 per month. I asked if I could still get the $30 per month option, and she said I was mistaken, that thereNEVER WAS THAT OPTION. Humm, I thought. \nI called the Henderson anytime gym, and asked if I came in today and signed up for 2 years, if a $30 per month rate was available. That gym said sure, so I called the one on Windmill that I had tried out, and the same manager answered. She said, sure, I could have the $30 per month rate. She was quizzing me on the phone, trying to figure out who I was and what she might have told me in the past. We set an appointment time, and I went in fuly pprepared to sign a 2 year contract. She remembered me, and apparently decided to change the deal.  Except she got out her notebook with blank spaces for her to write in the rates as she saw fit, and she wrote in a lowest rate of $35 per month.\nI got very angry by this time. She was clearly being manipulative, and I told her I didn't do business with dishonest people. She must have been a used car salesperson in her last job, because she denied the whole thing. What a liar.\nIt's too bad, because the one thing I've always gotten from any gym I joined was a staff who genuinely cares about their clients and want them to succeed. Clearly, this woman only cares about her own interests. I joined another gym further away, but with better options and people I can trust."
1,"This place is a cool neighborhood bar. Lots of friendly folks and sports always on the tv's. It has an interesting layout, with two rooms separated by an outdoor breezeway where the smokers hang out. It's a bit of a bummer because the smoke gets trapped in that area and is not nice for non-smokers who want to sit outside. But that's the only negative. The food is good. Love the sliders. And they have a good selection of beers. Also, they're always playing something at this bar: poker, trivia, etc. Maybe it's just when I'm there, but there's always something."
1,"As a college student I definetly couldn't afford to eat dinner at this excellent but expensive restaurant. I was lucky enough to be invited to dinner by a friend of mine, whose parents were in town and were staying at the Four Seasons.  I loved the ambiance the wait staff was professional, courteous, and attentive and provided the level of service you would expect from a luxury hotel restaurant. I think what's unique about this restaurant is that you can have any dish in an appetizer size or an entree size, and the dish is priced accordingly. I had the clam linguini, appetizer size and it was delicous the white wine sauce was superb along with the pasta, freshly chopped tomatoes, and clams.  Verandah also serves excellent bread while you wait for your meal. If you have an expense account, I highly recommend this restaurant."
0,"Such heavy seasonings and dressings that the actual food could not be tasted at all. So disappointing.   \n\nWe ordered: \nblistered green beans\nkale salad\nshrimp risoto\ntuna two ways\nfrench onion soup\n\nEach dish sounded amazing. Sadly, each dish disappointed. \n\nBlistered green beans: it was very difficult to taste the green beans as the dish was smothered in overpowering creamy curry sauce. Such heavy sauce was unnecessary and it doesn't complement the rest of the dishes on the menu. \n\nKale Salad: this too was drenched in dressing. The vinaigrette was strong and little of it would have gone a long way.  \n\nShrimp risotto:  this dish gets 5 stars. It was great! Risotto was of perfect texture, the grilled shrimp were done perfectly and their flavor was pure and delicious. The light tomato sauce complemented the rice and the shrimp well and nicely tied the dish together. \n\nTuna too ways:  the seared tuna was so salty that we couldn't eat it. The tartare was - you can guess - swimming in lemon juice. I happen to love lemon and generally want to add more lemon to dishes, but this tartare was a lemon bath. \n\nFrench onion soup: I did not eat this, but must say it's presentation was not very good.  My companion said it was a \""lazy preparation/presentation.\""  As we know, eating with our eyes is very important. \n\nOn top of all this, service was a zero.  The sommalier was the first and only person that spoke to us.... He took our wine order, delivered the wine. Very pleasant guy.  He then walked by our table multiple times and seeing as to how I was half way done with my wine, he decided to take our food order.  [Perhaps he cooked our food too?].   He told us it's tapas style so dishes will come out as they are ready.  OK, no problem. \n\nEverything came at the same time 20 minutes after we ordered.  Terrible. \n\nNo one came by to check on our food.  A waitress stopped by, fiddled with bills in her apron and took a plate off our table WITHOUT looking up at us or saying a word.  \n\nNo one else came by.  We only had one hour for dinner before our show so there was no time to complain and send the dishes back.  We both left hungry and sure we will never dine there again.  Immediately after we left, I saw a couple looking at the Menu by the restaurant entrance and I told them about our dinner and explained they were better off eating at the Food Court."
1,"Did you know Asian Food Trucks were a thing in Las Vegas? Did you even know they exist?\n\nSo if you read Emily R.'s reviews (she's Elite. I figured I would remind you before she did) she's a big fan of Fukuburger, and it was due time I got dragged along. Now, I'm not as big of a fan of Asian food as she is (I think PF Chang's is high dining) so I was a bit concerned. She recommended the Tamago, which is a burger with fried egg on top, and some kind of sauce. I think it's two sauces, actually: Teriyaki and something else. It's got bacon, and you can get it with cheese (I didn't).\n\nSounds good? Hai. (That's Japanese for yes. I'm bilateral.)\n\nMy only complaint about the burger is that the egg yolk was runny, and I like firmer eggs. (IN YOUR PANTS!! j/k) So next time I'll have to order it well-done. But other than that, this burger kicks more ass than Sailor Moon.\n\n(I'm running out of Japanese references.)\n\nBut the atmosphere was actually really badass! Hip hop playing, cars rollin', people laughing and kickin' back. It was a good community feel, and I wish I had hung out longer. I'm definitely up to go back.\n\nAnd when I do, I'm going to rock my Sailor Jupiter costume.\n\nOr not."
0,"Here is what we ordered: \nHam and Eggs and Steak and Eggs. \n\nBoth came with toast and fresh fruit. \n\nI ordered the ham and eggs, and ordered my eggs \""over well\"" and asked the waitress to have my yolks popped, because the sight of egg yolk running around my plate makes me ill. She had a little tude about \""over hard\"" versus \""over well\"", but I thought we had it settled...\n\nMy eggs came burned, with brown crispy crap all over them, and they were not hot. The toast came cold, with no butter or jam. The ham was okay, but \""off the bone\"" is an exaggeration. The fresh fruit was good. \n\nMy husband's eggs and steak were not hot, and his toast came cold, with no butter or jam, as well. \n\nHe complained, and the waitress said she would bring new orders to us, at which time I told her to just forget it as far as my order went, because I was STARVING. She brought me a new order of eggs, and I said that I didn't want them, and off in a huff she went. \n\nWhen my husband's (new) breakfast was delivered to the table, it was hot and everything was done correctly. However, no toast was present. \n\nWhat bugs me about this place, besides the fact that we both were served cold food, is the attitude of the waitress. \n\nYeah, I get it, it's Scottsdale, but as a Scottsdale resident, I am embarrassed by the holier-than-thou attitude you get from some of the businesses here. \n\nWe hadn't been here in years, and now I know why.\n\nDespite the long drive, we'll head back to Matt's Big Breakfast, which has THE freshest, most delicious breakfast in this area. And, no attitude..."
0,"I hate this place!! They over charge, the staff is horrible and the wait is terrible. I went in to get shots for nursing school and I literally waited for 2 hours. I saw 4 different people and none of them could help me. When all of it was over, I left completely disappointed. I've been a patient of there's for several years. I've been in desperate search for a new doctor but for some reason I always go back. After this experience I rather go to the ER then to go to this place again!!"
1,"Honestly, i was skeptical, everything that has such a buzz is usually disappointing.\n\nThe food was all great.. prices were reasonable.  Most importantly the service was excellent. # of us ate communal style and one out of 5 dishes were super salty.   The runner took the plate (almost full) away without asking if there was something wrong with it, the server didn't notice due to the busy night.  I felt compelled to say something since i usually don't.  After telling the server he took the initiative to tell the \""boss\"" , they immediately comped it.  I was so surprised since something so \""common sense seems to be not so common in this city.  Of course we over tipped the amount of the comp.  J\n\nI am a fan.\n\nThe space itself looks awesome.  All I can suggest is they reposition the entrance... maybe that huge window diagonal from it since you walk right in to an uncomfortable place.   But they are expanding... so lets see what happens."
0,"Although I feel that the Grand Canyon was cool to see, the way this place works is a total sham.  Basically, you pull up, they stick you in a parking lot, then charge you a bunch of money get on a bus where they drive you a whopping 5 miles round trip.\n-Bus cost: 40 dollars\n-Skywalk cost: 32 dollars\n-Know up front to skip the Skywalk and save yourself 32 dollars: Priceless\n\nDon't waste your money on the Skywalk. The views from Eagle Point and Guano Point are great, you don't need the Skywalk. Not only is it a ripoff, but the views through the glass don't even make it to the bottom of the canyon. Of course, you don't know that because they won't allow you to take your own camera out on the Skywalk. They instead opt to have someone else take pictures of you and charge you up the ass amounts for it like 17 dollars per photo.\n\nIf you do go to this location, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE SKYWALK. Just take the bus ride.\n\nOh, and eat right before you leave or bring snacks. The food there is a ripoff like everything else."
0,"I'm more of a cakey, gooey, crispy brownie-type girl. Fairytale Brownies are dense, grainy, and fudge-like. The flavors aren't spectacular, but more artificial tasting. Also, I don't like how each is individually wrapped and frozen then defrosted before selling. If I'm paying over $3 for a brownie, I expect it to be fresh."
1,"Finally came here with my daughter, it's pretty good so far. I'm doing AYCE n she's having her Sushi combo. The tempura is really good. Everything is good here. I gave my daughter a piece  of my Sushi even though they say you can't share food when you have AYCE, she just wanted to taste the white tuna, like what are they going to do, kick us out. Right?\nThe rice to nigiri sushi ratio is the best of all AYCE places but then they compensated it by having thinner slices of fish. Overall, a good place to come for sushi. Did not know their appetizers came with AYCE...-1 star...waitress should have explained."
0,"The staff was beyond rude, i saw some people comment positively about the midget bar, I just found it exploitive and offensive.  \n\nThe night I was there was not really busy, and I admit I tried to ask for something complicated (2 shots of Jagermeister and a can of red bull) and the man behind the bar proceeded to ask me \""what the fuck do you want?\"" and just mixed it in a glass anyways, then gave me all my change in singles as if i was obligated to leave a tip after being treated like a sub human. \n\nIt was my friends birthday so I asked if they had a specialty drink for birthday guests (which I was completely ready to pay for and I thought I did because I did not realize my drink alone was sooo expensive in such a ghetto place). They made him a concoction and poured it into a toilet plunger (which he thought was kind of cool), this completely stained his mouth green (it apparently also stained his bowel movements for the next 2 days as well). An hour or so later he went to order another \""plunger\"" they would not make him one because he already had one, instead of informing him it would cost $xx.xx. Just all around poor customer service. \n\nBesides all this the place was not exactly clean... \n\nI will never go back"
1,"We had a good trip to Mellow Mushroom on a Friday night. Although it felt more like a Chuck E. Cheese crowd or Kids Eat Free night with small humans outnumbering adults 2 to 1. Sure we were mad at first that there was no room to eat on the school bus, but i'm over it. \n\nWe ordered the buffalo pizza and liked it a lot. i mean $20 for a medium pizza seems a little high on my pizza price scale, but that's the way it goes for a delicious pizza in a fun environment.  \n\nThey appeared to have some wickedly huge booths that could probably seat more people than i know at one table which seemed kind of cool.   \n\ni was pleasantly surprised at a reasonably priced delicious beer on special for $3 draft on a Friday night. Also, outdoor patio will be nice to enjoy the weather and for those who prefer not to stare at the 1000 mushroom tips decorating the inside."
0,"This place is hit or miss and the late night drunks are not enjoyable either. I have rolled up and seen many cops outside and I am curious as to what is going on for them to be outside a pizza place but it seems they have trouble there from time to time. I think the pizza is so-so, sometimes its pretty good and other times its garbage. I recommend Jamies Pizza and Pita down the street, better service, pizza and its quieter. The only good thing is the Gus's stays open all the time."
0,"These guys are not good at troubleshooting and are very good at not fixing what needs to be done. I have used them for several years and the service has deterioated over that time. I brought a vehicle in and told them the car had a vibration at Idle, Eric called me back and told me that I needed brakes and new tires???? Really, thats your call for an idle vibration...new tires and brakes???? The bottom line here is they do not try to help find the problem they are just looking for there $90.00 per hour shop rate and another reason you need to spend more money!!!!!!"
1,"Best crab rangoon EVER. \n\nI made SURE to stop at Empire while in CU because I was dreaming about their crab rangoons.  $3 gets you 6.  Complete steal.\n\nEmpire also finally takes cc's , but there's lame $8 min."
0,"Mainly liked it from the outside - clever architecture and a roller coaster. But, it is like a bad version of a Disney Hotel. Frankly, I'd rather go to the real NYC, which by the way is in our country, than a gimmicky hotel themed like it. From afar, the pizza looked good at least."
0,"I went here every night after work *I'm a casino blackjack dealer) I always came in for the happy hour. I always loved this place, loved the food, loved the service. Till, one night I came in. The bartender wouldn't let me order the happy hour prices. Even though,  it WAS happy hour and I came here about 5 nights a week. When the bartender wouldn't give me the price, I told him to cancel my food order so I could leave. He gave me the bill immediately and told me that if I didn't pay full price, I would be banded forever. I literally left, and despite my favorite food., will never return again. :("
1,"Just went here for lunch and ordered the beef salad. I'm eating it right now, it is phenomenal. It is honestly making love to my mouth. This place is very, very clean. The staff is more than courteous and the service is very quick. The prices are actually quite good here especially at lunch. This is actually one of the best Thai places I've been to in Vegas. \n\n[p.s.- the ladies that work here are quite attractive which further added to my experience. ;)]\n\nI will be back again and again. I highly suggest it."
0,"Very low integrity bike shop. Which is now apparent from all of the other yelp reviews (unfortunately I realized this too late). If you don't feel like reading the whole story, the gist is this: Larry sold me a used Walmart bike for $30 more than Walmart sells it new and charged me an additional $38 (\""tune-up fee\"") when I returned it the next day. \n\nI spotted a used Schwinn road bike in front of the shop that looked in great shape and the price was awesome. Larry came out and allowed me to take it for a spin. Afterwards he proceeded to build up the bike as an awesome deal. He stated \""oh wow, we don't see deals like this come through our shop very often\"" and \""these types of bikes usually sell for $700-800.\"" Larry used the typical sales techniques, which is fine. What Larry neglected to mention in his extensive praise of this bike was that the bike is actually from Walmart and it retails brand new for about $30 less than he was selling it used. I will take the blame for not doing my homework on the bike before purchasing it. \n\nThe next day I went to return the bike. \""I need to return this bike it's not what I'm looking for.\"" Larry immediately flips his demeanor and basically begins pouting about the fact that he is now going to have to spend all of this time \""re-tuning\"" the bike. Larry not to worry, I bought it yesterday and the bike literally didn't touch the pavement. \""Ahh yeah but we can never know for sure, we still have to charge you $38 for a re-tuning/re-stocking fee.\"" I'll spare you every pathetic detail but when I called him out on the fact that it was a Walmart bike and it won't need re-tuning he said something VERY interesting. \""Well those Walmart bikes are poor quality. We don't buy bikes from Walmart or Amazon.\"" To which I replied, \""That's funny Larry, I don't either. That's why I'm returning the bike.\"" Still paid the $38. Hmmmm.\n\nAgain, I'm willing to admit a little naivety on my part but the way Larry handled everything was extremely shady and lacked a shred of integrity.  \n\nPlain and simple, there is too much competition in this area to do business like this. I (and apparently many other customers on yelp) recommend shopping somewhere else."
0,"I've ordered delivery from here before, and it had previously has been a pleasant experience. After a very frusterating phone call to order 2 pizzas on a what-should-be easy and slow tuesday night, I gave up and ordered pizza hut. The girl at the other end was completely unprofessional and was distracted by someone else talking to her, I even had to ask her stop listening to the other people and to listen to me. She didnt even notice I had ordered 2 different pizzas with two different toppings by the time I had her read me back the order. Then she said my one pizza was going to be burnt because they were going to go in at the same time? I was so frusterated that i told her to cancel the order. I hope this was just a one-time thing, because I really do like their pizzas."
1,"Got the Planet Hollywood dog. It's a polish sausage with onions, bacon, cheese and awesome. It's messy and delicious. Yes, it's a hot dog. If you came here thinking high quality food, you must be trippin. Hot dogs. Keep your expectations in check. For what it is, it's awesome. Little more expensive than their LA location but it's a nice little meal after a night of drinking."
1,"I've been coming to Colectivo ever since it opened in Madison. I definitely fell more in love with the space than anything else the first time I came here. I pretty much go for an iced coffee or iced chai, and if I want something non caffeinated I  go for one of their smoothies! I have to say I adooooore their hot chocolate too but I have a feeling that it is unabashedly full of cream and sugar and chocolate so I try to my keep my hot chocolate consumption to a minimum. I love hanging out here whenever I just want to chill and read some articles, sketch, or have some me time. It's also a great space to have quick impromptu meetings. They never play their music too loud and the patio is fantastically spacious when it's not too humid out. The indoor space with the French windows that open up is probably my favorite since you get the outdoor breeze without it being overwhelming. The service is prompt and polite but I'm not a huge fan of the food I've tried. It's mostly average to above average coffee shop food to me, but good enough when you need something to eat. \n\nOverall I have to say that Colectivo is a pretty regular stop for me and I don't see that changing much in the future."
0,I stopped going to this place years ago. the food is horrible and the people are sooo rude. and the seafood made me sick. don't waste your time or money
1,"Chandler Fashion is a nice upscale Mall and one of the best in the greater Phoenix area,\n\nWe've been coming here for over five years, longer if you count before we moved to the Valley. It's your typical double decker setup, with the usual anchors like Macy's, Sears, Dillard's, Nordstrom and Barnes & Nobles built in a semicircle.\n\nIn many ways, we like Chandler Fashion over the one in Scottsdale with the same name. Scottsdale Fashion has been built-out, piece meal and can be crazy busy at times.  The developer of both is Westcor, a sub of giant real estate holding company Macerich. \n \nHere the movie theater setup makes more sense. It's outside and has a group of restaurants attached to it. So you can stop and eat, before or after your movie. Also, because it's located it's easier getting in and out without the necessity of walking through the Mall.  Nice!\n\nEnjoy the shopping."
1,"An unmarked building.  Dark, mood lighting inside.  A DJ in the back spinning records (this night was techno!).  I present you Natt Spil.  Such an interesting, yet lovely ambiance.\n\nThe ambiance feels really cozy, and everyone is situated at wooden tables/booths throughout.  It reminded me of a place I had been to in NYC that I had ventured to before, and absolutely adored.\n\nThey had a great beer selection, and their pizzas looked divine (I wish we had come sooner to try a few)!  I was in a fancy mood, and opted for a glass of sauvignon blanc to tide the evening over. Also, bring cash, or use their ATM in the back."
1,"Excellent beer selection, quality food and attentive service. BBQ ribs outstanding. Sammie a wonderful server."
1,Great Time!
1,"This place is great! Cash only.  My stylist was Summer, and she was so on point!  She did my bangs the way I was hoping and cleaned up my layers for me.  Summer knew exactly what I was going for and made it happen. \n\n$8 is such a steal! \n\nShe was nice enough to do my hair even though she was supposed to be done for the day b/c she saw me waiting.  On top of that she was nice enough to listen to my drama!  I had such a fun time=)"
0,"I wish I had something positive to say about my hair but I didn't even get a chance to try this place out! I asked the lady at the front if anyone was available for a consultation and after giving me a lackluster \""I'll check\""...she didn't get back to me for 15 minutes! I walked back up to the counter to ask again and it seemed like she had forgotten. Disappeared to the back and came back after another 10 min, didn't acknowledge me at all so I ask again and still not a yes OR no! I wait even longer while she is checking AGAIN. Nothing. I'm standing in front of you!!! I obviously left....if they can't even figure out how to sit me in a chair in front of a stylist then how can I dare trust whatever stylists they may have???? Pretty disappointed to say the least. It would have been an expensive job, too."
1,"As far as Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas go, for me, Viva Mercado's reigns supreme.  We've been coming to Viva ever since they were at there former location on Flamingo.  I really loved the funkiness of the first location and initially felt that the new location on Rainbow was a little, I don't know, sterile in comparison. \n\nWe hadn't been to Viva for a long while - and we had some celebrating to do!  We arrived pretty early for dinner on a Friday and were seated immediately.  Being the good Yelper that I am, I immediately checked in.  To my surprise Viva offers a 20% off your bill check-in offer!  Win!\n\nOnce we were seated we received a basket of their complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip.  I like the salsa, but LOVE the bean dip.  It's hard to leave room for the main course!  We ordered up our entrees and drinks - Tostadas Acapulco-style and a Sauzarita Margarita (Sauza Gold w/ Grand Marnier) on the rocks for me.  They serve one of my favorite fideo soups here, and it was as good as I remembered it. \n\nWhen the entrees arrived they were RIDICULOUSLY HUGE!  My tostadas were piled high with a ceviche-like mountain of chilled shrimp, langostino, and crab with pico de gallo, queso fresco and a dab of sour cream.  Refreshing citrus flavors and huge chunks of seafood.  So yummy - but I could only finish one.  We asked our terrific server (didn't get his name but he was great) for boxes - and they surprised us with complimentary freshly-made churros at the end of the meal.  I managed to polish off one of the churros, even though I was totally stuffed.\n\nLove you Viva - I promise not to stay away too long next time!"
0,"I used to love dining here. In fact we would come here up to 3x a month and spend an average of $100+ but, not ever again. Don't use the restroom while dining here or you will be accused of running out on the tab, even BEFORE you get your food.  That's right folks, they had contacted surveillance to see where I went, then had security waiting outside of the restroom. Like I said I didn't even get my food until AFTER being harassed.  \n\nVery poor management for being so accusational. \n\nMy husband and I dine out quite frequently as you can all see by my Yelp check-ins (in fact we don't even check-on to all places we dine at) but, never have we been accused of running out on a check. \n\nI'm so upset with Twin Creeks and will spend my money elsewhere. I recommend my fellow Yelpers to follow suit so they do not have to experience something like this."
1,"I love, love, love this place !  \n\nWhen I moved back to Vegas I brought back with me an addiction for pho, boba & egg rolls. I had searched around the Spring Valley area, coming across Jenni Pho Grill, Saigon 8 and little Saigon 8 but nothing compared when I came across Da Lat. \n\n  At Da Lat you have a selection of different kinds of boba , jelly boba and pearl balls (that burst with different kinds of flavors) to go with your slushie / smoothie. It seriously is the best thing ever when I am sipping on my mango slush. \n\n Their combination pho is on point! They offer every meat from rare beef to tendon with just the right amount of veggies and noodles. My main thing is the noodles, but the flavorabl broth fills me up and I sometimes leave noodles hanging. \n\n The egg rolls are way more crispier and have more flavor in the fish sauce than any other pho restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas. The only downfall I have is the fact I was spoiled in San Diego with 6 egg rolls for $6. Ahaha. But still, I love Da Lat.\n \nTheir staff is friendly and helpful whenever I go in and that's usually around midnight - 2AM."
1,A+ for effort. I love the view and the service has always been wonderful. The food is good. I think the food is very good and honestly I've had better Mexican food but they get 5 stars bc they are wonderful for large parties as well as a cozy environment for a simple date night.  You can't go wrong suggesting this for dinner!  I love good service!
1,"CUT is what I envision a steakhouse in heaven would be like. \nIn fact, if and when I get to heaven, if there isn't a place like CUT there, I will be extremely disappointed.\n\nWe went here for a friend's birthday dinner. We had a reservation, arrived on-time, and were seated promptly. The waiter was extremely knowledgable and attentive. He explained the menu thoroughly and answered any and every question we had. His recommendations were great and his overall demeanor was friendly and nice. When our food arrived he was joined by several other servers who dished out our sides. The overall presentation and service was very good - I felt quite pampered :)\n\nNow onto the main thing - The Food. AMAZING!! The cheese puffs were delicious, as were the breadsticks. The pretzel bread was wonderful too. But the main course was a grand-slam. There were 4 of us, we each got a different cut of steak and we were all in love with what we ordered. We each got a side to share, and I loved them all, especially the macaroni and cheese but MOST OF ALL the creamed spinach and egg. I was the one who ordered the spinach, based on what other Yelpers had said and that dish did NOT disappoint!!! It was fantastic, and I wouldn't have ordered it had it not been so highly rated by others on here, so thanks Yelpers for helping me step out of my comfort zone and try something new there. \n\nBy dessert I was too full for much else, but we got a banana something? and a lemon something? - sorry, I'm being super helpful here, I know - but both were good. But nothing compared with the main meal. It was out-of-this-world delicious.\n\nI should note, here that there was one negative - our waiter forgot our friend's salad. She brought it to his attention, and he apologized and offered to bring it out with the meal, but she declined. But I noticed on the bill that he comped us our desserts, which was a nice touch.\n\nThe bill came to roughly $450 or so for the 4 of us, so no, not cheap but worth it! I think everyone should splurge on a fantastic meal every now and then, and I'm glad we did that at CUT. It was wonderful."
0,"Terrible service at ticket counter, a friend bought complimentary tickets for me and they would not provide because I was not the same person who purchased them so I had to cancel the order and put them on my credit card.  Employees terribly rude and unhelpful and made me late for show.  The show was good if you can avoid the terrible service issues."
1,"My first buffet in Las Vegas and I have to say I was pretty blown away for $30. The seafood selection was ok, but everything was of great quality and not over salted. I enjoyed the fresh juices (Tamarindo, Orchata, Mango, etc.) and the bbq selections. The prime rib was perfect and so was the hen and spicy sausage. I also had some shao mai (shumai?) and ha kao. I was also able to squeeze in some desserts and I enjoyed the chocolate creme brulee, flan, and carrot cake. The cheesecake was very mild in flavor and didnt feel right in terms of texture. It was too smooth. I wish I had a bigger appetite to try more since there was Mexican, Italian, and Asian cuisines that I missed out on.\n\nI'd come here again if I people wanted to try it, but otherwise I'll hit up the next buffet to see what others have to offer."
1,"Even though I don't come here THAT often, I always take someone who is visiting from out of town. \n\nWith 20 different kinds of white russians who wouldn't want to go here? It really does make it exciting to Lebowskis. I've had probably 5 different kinds myself and each one is amazing. I swear, I'd take one of these over dessert anyday. de-lish. \n\nWarning: the drink called 'The Big Lebowski' is HONESTLY the big lebowski. It was basically a pint of milk.. with whipped cream.. and chocolate sauce.. My brother got it for himself after already having a regular one and had a moment of near sickness. It was just a bit too much. But! It would be okay for sharing with someone for fun. \n\nI've also had the food here once and it was a nice experience. I've heard great things about their pies.I'd like to return to try something else. \n\nI think you can also have private parties here? I've seen curtains drawn to divide the bar in half for a birthday party. Might be kinda cool for a party, no?"
1,I really like this room. Others said it was cramped but I did not find it that way. Love the chips and the felt. The chairs are comfortable. You just feel like you are in one of the best poker rooms in the world when you play there. The drink service was excellent. They serve champagne with a strawberry. The sports book is steps away. The lighting is nice and subdued. I definitely enjoyed my time playing here.
0,"I usually go to tip and toes to get pampered with a manicure and pedicure however one day I was running a little late and I stopped at Paulenes on Hayden.  I was greeted and off to a good start, then all went downhill.  I was in the service industry for almost ten years so I always take good care of anyone recieving tips (just as a side note) I was helped by the main lady, who was on the phone the whole time, didn't finish my nail paint job (which was a complete mess I could have done a better job painting them) and walked away when one of her \""regulars\"" came in.  I saw where her prioraties were and it was not to me! I had to ASK another lady help me finish my pedicure and when trying to pay I also encountered the main lady which took another ten minutes extra because she was avoiding me to pay attentin to the other regular! I never recieved a thank you or even an apology.  Needless to say I will NEVER set foot in there again and I advise you not to either!"
0,"I almost didn't want to review Whisky River, but it popped up in the cue so I figured why not?  I've been here a few times for friends birthday parties, their choice, not mine, I can assure you. This place is what it claims to be, a place for people to get hammered during bachelorette parties and birthdays, and dubious cats to oggle scantily clad bartenders and waitstaff.  That pretty much sums it up. Throw in a mechanical bull-ride, and some cheesy Top-40 tunes and you've got the picture. Just not my kind of place, but it serves it's purpose I suppose..."
0,"One thing a hungry girl should never forget - if the restaurant is empty (it was lunch hour nonetheless) there is a reason!  I dined all alone at Piccadilly Freemont - and not because I'm a lonely thirty-something spinster!  Well, I guess I am a lonely thirty-something spinster - but that's not why I dined alone.  Trust me, this joint was empty for good reason.  \n\nThis place is just awful.  I don't know what brand of frozen pizza they toss in the microwave to serve their patrons, but I can assure you it's on the low-end of the freezer-section pizza spectrum.  I ordered the $5.99 special - 2 cheese slices and a 16 oz soda and it seemed like a bargain until I got my food.   I looked at those puffy, pitiful, slices of pizza  crusted over with a few shreds of cheese, and my heart sank.  Moments like these make me pause and wish I was more of an outspoken trouble maker.  I wish I had the nerve to thrust my chin forward and demand my money back.  However, since I am about as spineless as a gummy bear that's been sitting in the sun for an hour, I took my sad little lunch and ate all whilst plotting my yelp revenge.  \n\nThey couldn't even get my diet coke right.  The 16 oz cup was filled to the brim with ice and perhaps 3 sips of soda.  How very disappointing.  I expected better Freemont street!  Well, not really.  I guess I should have known I was strolling down the boulevard of tourist traps.  I'm ashamed that, as a local Las Vegan, I didn't have the sense to keep on strolling.\n\nDo yourself a favor folks, skip this joint.  It's a waste of calories!"
0,"Ordered Peking duck for delivery at 5:30 yesterday.  I was told it would take 45 minutes, but the food did not arrive until after 7:00.  I had to throw it in the microwave because it was no longer hot.  The duck itself was not that great; the skin (usually the best part of the duck) was soggy instead of crispy and the meat lacked flavor.  If anyone knows a place in Pittsburgh that serves good Peking duck, please message me."
0,"This has changed over time and it looks like it has been bought up by Disney recently. \n\nMade to be fun for tourists, this tour involves a ride through the fermenting process and treating tour. After the random theme park ride you are then walked into what looks like a school room and given a presentation (although in the past it was mostly spoken now it seems to be predominantly slides) before you pick a whisky flavour and get to tasting. \n\nYou are then shown into the whisky collection room where you hear about the bottles around you until it is time to go to the shop. \n\nVarious prices available based of of the amount of time you want to spend here, but I recommend the cheapest option as it's quite dear and you can later go test your newfound whiskey tastebuds in the pub. \n\nI would recommend going to an actual distillery, but for tourists it would likely be a nice time."
1,"Ive been to Culvers alot. My son loves it and the cheese curds are A-mazing! I always felt like it was a bit pricey for \""fast food\"" until I went to five guys... wow! Id pay the extra money for a butter burger anytime! Culvers is way better than any fast food burger place in Surprise hands down and also better than five guys and half the cost. I will never complain about the prices again. The shakes are good. The burgers and fries are good and as I said before.. cheese curds for the Win! :)"
1,"If you like genuine NY brick oven pizza made with fresh mozzarella,tasty tomato sauce and quality meats, this is da place! Choice of freshly made crusts..thick or thin..both are great. I'm fourth generation off the boat  Italian and fussy about my pizza and this really hits the spot. A large pizza with toppings is a reasonable under $20.00. Mangia!"
1,"Absolutely excellent meal from top to bottom, the Wellington was a life experience in perfection.   Highly recommend getting the desserts, we have the sticky toffee pudding, and it was unbelievably delicious.   Bring an extra stomach or two, you won't want to stop when full ;p"
1,"I had the bone in $42 Tomahawk ribeye.  It was excellent, not quite as good as Golden Steer but better than any others I've had in Vegas.  My friend had the $36 Halibut and said it was very good, definitely fresh fish and the vegetables were very tasty.  I usually don't comment on the salad but I must say this house salad, a spinach leaf salad, with vinaigrette dressing was the best salad I've had anywhere.  The service was also top notch from start to finish.  I highly recommend!"
0,"To be fair, I will note that I've only been to Green Mango Noodle Hut one time. \n\nI went with a friend's recommendation for the Tom Kha soup (which is my favorite dish at Thai Cuisine) and the fresh spring rolls. I asked very clearly about chicken/beef stock and fish sauce and the server assured me that the soup was completely vegetarian. \n\nThe soup contained fish sauce. I am not morally offended but I do have an acute aversion to the flavor. Unrelated to my request, I also think that they dilute their coconut milk with dairy, a common cost cutting trick at \""cheap\"" Asian restaurants. \n\nThe spring rolls were good, though the dipping sauce was boring (like straight from a jar). \n\nMid-way through the meal, the server threw our check onto the table. Um, good thing I wasn't going to mention the issue with my soup! And my friend, she didn't need that ice cream she had wanted for dessert!\n\nThen, as if we weren't still sitting there, the server cleared some PBR cans from the table next to us and set them on our table! \n\nIs it unfair to say that I will not return?"
0,This place is always very busy at lunch time and I dont understand. They serve high priced super lame cafeteria food. This falls just below fussali for the worst dining option at park central.
1,"Stayed at the MGM Signature Suites before, but never in a room like Las Vegas Suites was able to book.  The room was fabulous and the balcony facing the pool was incredible.  We were on the top floor of the hotel and had an amazing view, even saw a Las Vegas sunrise right off the balcony.  Great price, great room, and amazing service."
0,"Stopped in for lunch today to this, the smallest Mexican restaurant in the world except for Taco Bite!\n\nThis La Canasta (of many, & much variation) seats just 17, at 3 tables plus 5 stools at a built-in counter.  It struck me as clean inside, & was fairly busy during my 11 AM visit, partly with takeout orders.  Ok Mexican pop music played, & the air temperature & lighting were about right.\n\nI ordered a #1 Lunch Special from one of the not-very-friendly staff members, which brought out a ground beef hard taco, a beef tamale, & a tostada.  This food was ok but not great, & you have to be careful how you order here, or the prices are HIGH!  That limits your lunch options a lot if you care anything about value, & rendered this place completely NOT SPECIAL.  Ok, it's better than Taco Bite!     :-O\n\nTaco, Tamale & Tostada Plate $5.99"

0,"Okay...we are huge foodies, so maybe our bar is set a little high?  We truly liked the atmosphere, the staff was super nice, and they have a good variety of drinks to choose from.  Our appetizer salads were AWESOME...I had the wedge and my husband had the spinach.  And the sweet potato fries were incredible.  But seriously....if you are going to be a \""burger bistro\""....shouldn't you have absolutely KILLER burgers?  (aka. Zinburger @ Biltmore)  \n\nI should have known when none of the burgers were really jumping off of the menu at either one of us.  We settled on the Buffalo and the Kobe.  The buffalo burger was boring, definitely underseasoned (ever heard of salt?), and the buns - where they were super soft and fresh - had a heavy taste of butter...I mean to the point of leaving a film on your tongue.  The kobe beef was delicious, seasoned well, but overcooked (I ordered medium-rare and got medium-well)...so the burger itself was boring.   It has asparagus and blue cheese...and, coming from a person that loves cheese, it is the lightest blue cheese ever...no punch at all, so relatively bland in flavor for this burger as well.  My husband even went so far as to say that he only had 2 good bites on his whole burger.\n\nWe are total burger lovers so we just weren't impressed.  Maybe we could try the \""build it yourself\"" menu next time, but we were really hoping for some really good, imaginative burgers from the chef.  :("
0,"I LOVE the idea of this place!  It is a very colorful interesting place.  The people that run it are poor business people and jerks.  \n\nThe website should be your first clue.  When you read about how they cannot accommodate people with gmail - run.  Then the way you register is almost archaic in this day and age - send an email???\n\nAfter my free introductory class for my child where I felt absolutely unwanted - parents are NOT allowed to watch (WHAT??? How do I know what my child is learning so I can reinforce that in the kitchen at home???), the instructor was in a pissy mood (she actually said something to the effect of \""if you older kids feel like this is too slow for you we have better classes, there are younger kids in here and I don't know why).  I sent an email to Chef Kathy to give her my feedback.  She defended everything that happened during our \""introductory\"" class.  If I didn't believe in the value of teaching kids to cook then I would NEVER return.  And this is the class that is supposed to be the hook to get you to buy a membership???\n\nAdditionally, she uses groupon a lot.  The last groupon in april sold 2,111 spaces in the class.  It seems like they only have about  2 - 3 classes per day with about 10 students each.  That's only about 30 spaces per day, plus they have to accommodate their membership students.  So here it is the beginning of June and all of June's classes are still sold out.  Most of July's classes are sold out.  How are you ever supposed to get a space in this place at this rate???  Not to mention they are only getting about $5 for each of these students due to the price of the groupon so I wonder how much longer they can pay the bills.\n\nI think someone who actually enjoys teaching children, cooking, believes in good customer service and has a GOOD business sense should open their own YCA.  After all, it is a franchise and I would definitely go there and leave this one in the dust.\n\nI would also stay away from Chef Jo, I think she hates kids."
0,"We were looking for a place to grab a few appetizers and drinks after a morning/afternoon of gambling in Vegas and from the outside La Salsa Cantina appeared to offer just that.  We were very wrong.  Six of us walked into the empty restaurant and we were quickly greeted by our server and we ordered 6 Tecates as soon as we sat down.  We then ordered an order of guacamole, queso and the steak nachos.  All of them were fairly tasteless and average at best (I would give the food 2 stars).  So our food comes out and we start eating, but our Tecates are nowhere to be found.  About 45 minutes later we are done with our meal and we ask for our check.  As he brings out our check and notices the Tecates on there he tells us he will be right back with our beers.  I politely told him that it's a little late for that and we just needed to leave to which he replied \""Oh, so you don't want the beers you ordered anymore?\"".  The whole exchange was a little mind boggling and I wish I could have the 45 minutes of my life that I spent at La Salsa Cantina back.  \n\nAs we left and were walking to our next destination I noticed a Chiptole.  I have not eaten at this Chipotle, but I am postive that going to that Chiptole and spending 15 minutes eating a burrito and then the other 30 minutes as a handbiller passing out escort service cards to tourists while wearing an orange shirt that says \""Girls Girls Girls\"" would have been more enjoyable than our 45 minutes at La Salsa Cantina."
0,"Cafe Bink was on my \""to-do\"" list for a long time.  We went up there Saturday night and I was sorely disappointed.  The French fries, as everyone mentions, were really good, and we liked the sauces they came with (the sauce vert was our favorite, the aioli needed a little bit more garlic).  I had the fried chicken, which was covered in breadcrumbs, rather than batter.  It looked like Shake n Bake and didn't taste much better.  Oh well, I guess I can scratch this one off my list."
0,"Seriously?! People are lining up to come here? Embarrassing...\n\nAt first I thought maybe I was just getting too old for this sh!t but no.. it's not me. This place is loud! (What?!) LOUD! (Huh?!) Don't even bother talking, just smile and shake your ass.\n\nBring your own drink because you WILL be old by the time you get served and then you'll be broke from $9 drinks. And the bartenders charge me something different each time. Come on now! As a member of the 30K-Milli club, you know I won't be able to fill up gas in my parents Benz now!\n\nThe only thing great about this place is that the girls are slutty. I like seeing flashes of their Lady Gagas and TaTas but its not worth the wait."
1,"This place is beautiful. Didn't golf here so don't know how the whole course is. But we had cocktails at the above restaurant, the country club, and it overlooks this course. It was gorgeous, the bf stated when we come back he is definitely playing!!"
1,Melrose kitchen is quaint and quirky like the best little diners are! The service was great and the food was even better! This little gem hiding in the Melrose District is the place to be for a great cafe breakfast!
1,This location is far preferable to the 'original'. Way better feel and flow of the building. Gotta love the panini and salad split :)
0,"So it's late at night, you've been drinking in a town that never stops pouring. In the final round, you decide to take on some local culture at a nearby dive bar where you realize that the $4.99 breakfast buffet really doesn't hold up it's own. Stomach grumbling, you find yourself stumbling around in a \""not-so-good\"" neighborhood searching for something to curb the battle going on inside your empty insides. The bartender pointed you in the direction down Twain Ave where, like a beacon of salvation, your quest for greasy food is at an end.\n\nVictor's Taco Shop is about as \""authentic\"" as you get. Upon entry, you're blasted with warm air. The temperature in this place is even hotter than it is outside! That explains the extremely sweaty cooks behind the counter who are all but unaware of your arrival. The sound of Mariachi music is blaring from behind the counter and your only relief from the sweltering heat is a power fan blowing in the direction towards the counter itself.  \n\nYou order a plate of 5 Rolled Tacos  with everything on it and the counter cook looks at you like you're speaking a foreign language. He repeats the order, but shorter and asking (in broken English) how many you want. You tell him that you want 5 Rolled Tacos, he looks at you again like he doesn't understand. He asks if you want 5 orders of rolled tacos. You correct him and say you only want 5 of them. He responds with a completely off base response asking if you want an Number 5.\n\nAgain you correct him, now pointing to the picture on the menu with the 5 Rolled Tacos. He gets it now and you clarify that you wanted the sour cream and guacamole on it as well. The cook confirms and they get to work on your order. After what seems like an eternity standing there waiting for your order you contemplate playing one of the video games sitting along the wall. The screen is faded and you decide to pass.\n\nMeanwhile, a young Hispanic man enters the Taco Shop. His pupils are heavily dilated and he's giving off nervous energy. He places his order in Spanish, pays for the meal, and moments later. The burrito is in his hands and he's out the door. You notice that your rolled tacos are sitting on the ledge under the heat lamps.\n\nThe counter cook notices that you noticed as well and hands them to you with a malicious smile. He got one on the gringo. Realizing that you don't have anything to wash the tacos down with, you purchase a bottle of Coca-Cola for $2.25. Peeling back the aluminum foil on your rolled tacos, you are greeted by the food slapped together poorly. The guacamole and sour cream are runny.  Defeated, hungry, and now your buzz is gone you finish your rolled tacos. You exit the restaurant only to realize that there's a Roberto's in the same strip mall.\n\nMy $.02 Cents:\n2 Stars - Poor food quality,  hot and gross dining facility, poor service. My suggestion is to head to Roberto's right behind them. You get more for you money and don't need to speak Spanish to get good service."
0,Place is dirty. Out server was rude & the Shepard's Pie was the worst I've ever had. How they remain in business is beyond me.
0,"I was severely disappointed with this particular Osaka. I absolutely love the one on Sahara, and wanted to give this branch a try. I definitely regret it. At lunch time, there were only three parties when there should have been a large lunch rush - and for good reason. The service was slow, extremely, extremely slow. It took about 20 minutes just to get our first sushi roll. The bento boxes we ordered were overpriced for what you've served, and half of it was cold by the time it got to our table. I will not be visiting the Summerlin Osaka in the future, and instead will stick with the Sahara Osaka, which has fast service, better prices, and is overall excellent, quite the contrary to this branch."
1,"Great restaurant, especially for those interested in commercial real estate investment.  Lots of options for vegetarians, those who are price conscious, and likely to be an amenable decision when interns are tasked with deciding on a location for lunch.  Very good food."
1,"Went to Amp specifically because of the review about Nicole below.  It was everything I could have asked for, she took a loot at my skin and then treated my skin specifically.  I had a nasty blemish that she also made quick work of.  Will be going to see her again at the Amp Salon on my next trip to Vegas!\n\nThe facilities are a little on the bare side but the hot tubs and outdoor patio with hot tub that overlooks the pool was very cool and fun."
1,Excellent experience renting from Josh. Very helpful and informative.  Made the process simple.
1,My favorite sushi place in vegas.  Eaten there 4 times and I never left disappointed.   First tried it because Dessert magazine voted it to have the best quesadilla in vegas with its Brie and grape quesadilla.  While that is excellent I love their sushi even more.  They have an extensive list of specialty rolls stuffed with avocado and cream cheese.  My favorite rolls on the menu are the double d and the Tod.  When I'm getting towards the end I order a pania and a a d.a which are desert like with their sweet tempura.  Last of all I finish with a Vegas roll which is not on the menu. Stuffed with scallops and cream cheese.  Perfect way to end
1,"We had a great experience here. I had the shrimp and bacon quesadilla and G had the wings. My quesadilla was excellent and G said he had never had wings like these before (maybe they weren't fried? Not sure.), but that wasn't a bad thing because he said he would order them again. We must have gotten some kind of happy hour pricing because both of our items were $6 - what a nice surprise when our check came! \n\nOur food and drinks came promptly and the service was good. I was surprised by how sweet the hostess was. I felt like the menu was reasonably priced - I don't remember anything being over $10; but the kid's meals seemed a bit pricey at $5.49. Still, Bambino's seems like the perfect, family-friendly neighborhood bar. We will definitely be back!"
1,"I have been taking  my dog(7yr old) here for three  years and have yet to be disappointed. They have been my most used groomer since I have had my dog.  To me customer service is key.  When previous groomers have failed I just chose a new groomer.  WPS has been courteous and attentive to my dog's needs.  I will continue to have my dog groomed here until they fail, I move or my dog dies."
1,Had a problem with the bill and the service could have been a little better...  Great wine selection.   I will be back to give it another shot...
0,"Remember the Soup Nazi in Seinfeld?  That's what this place reminds me of.  I have been coming here the last 6-7 years.  Service is mediocre on their best day though their food is pretty decent.  (Let me rephrase that... they would not make it as a Chinese restaurant in LA or SF China Town, but it's a good Chinese noodle house given the slim picking in Vegas).  \n\nI have put up with their abuse and mediocre service over the years.  My complaints to Venetian customer service had largely gone unanswered.  Still, given the convenience of its location, I have tolerated such bad service, until tonight.\n\nIn any case, the latest episode took place tonight.  It's 9:30 on Saturday night.  I thought I would try to get a bite by myself.  When I got there, I noticed 2 empty seats at the bar so I walked up and try to sit down.  The hostess promptly kicked me out and told me to stand in the back of the line.  Amazingly, like a well-trained starved puppy, I obediently went to the back of the line and waited for my turn.  As I finally made it to the front of the line, as luck would have it, all the seats the bar are now taken.  I offered to wait on the side as there is now a long line BEHIND me, but of course, the waitress told me I have to go back to the END OF THE LINE, again!  What?  I just went from the back to the front of the line and now I have to stand in the back AGAIN, a SECOND time?  \n\nI thanked her and left without eating.\n\nWhen are these people going to learn that at the end of the day, it's still about customer service.  I suppose given that Venetian allows them to still be around, in spite of such consistent and persistent subpar service, someone must be happy with them.  I guess as long as they are paying rents, that's all Venetian cares about.  Either that, or perhaps acceptable customer service does not matter to sleep-deprived gamblers.  \n\nBottom line, if you are willing to be abused and mistreated for a bowl of good noodles, this is the place for you.  If being treated like a human being matters to you, DO NOT COME HERE."
1,The drinks are a little more expensive than most places in Madison but a whole lot better than most! They have the best monitor in Madison in my opinion but I have not gotten a mojito at the usual craft drink places like Merchant's. I don't feel they are on par with the creativity as Merchant's but they can make a mean drink. It sounds like a weird drink but my husband really enjoyed the Scotch version of the blind Russian. Unique but very good flavor! This is a great place to grab a drink or two before a long wait for seating at Red Sushi. If you are a fan of mojitos check them out!
1,This place is great!!!  I have been getting my hair cut there for around five years.  My whole family of five goes to Great Clips.  \nWe are never disappointed and believe me....we are picky.\nWe first started going to GC because we were new to AZ and was close to our house but we tried a few other places.  They were more expensive and we just didn't like our cut as well.\nAsk for Ester or Olga they are great!!!  The whole staff is very friendly and well trained.
1,"2 words: Pleasantly surprised\n\nAfter the mediocre reviews on yelp and my brother's average comments about this place, I was reluctant to try this place, but it was on MvF, so how could I not? I was in Pittsburgh for 20 hours (got in at 11pm and was leaving at 7pm the next day). Turned out my hotel was a few blocks from this location and it was open till midnight, so as fate would have it, I gorged.\n\nI didn't want to mess up my one and only shot to get Primanti Bros, so I wavered and asked the employee what I should get since I was debating between the corned beef or pastrami. AHA! There was a corned beef/pastrami combo. DONE.\n\nI really enjoyed my sandwich. Meaty, carby, cheesy, crunchy, delicious. The meat was nice and tender, the russian dressing was a classic addition, the fries were fresh and hot. It was all really good. Was it the best pastrami/corned beef, I've ever had in my life? Not quite, but it is damn good. I'd definitely go back.\n\nI even ran back to my hotel at 11:30pm so I could hurry up and eat it and it was still good. Also, it helped burn off 10 of the 1000+ calorie dinner."
1,"Terrific company!  I had a leather recliner that needed repair & cleaning. Called Friday afternoon. They picked it up, fixed it and returned it to my home Saturday afternoon. First class service all around & nice people too."
1,"Stopped in for a quick take-out of sticky rice & peanut sauce (craving) :).\n\nService was fast & friendly... I was served a glass of ice water with lemon while I waited (didn't have to ask). Prices were low, sticky rice was good, and their menu tempted me with more offerings and savory aromas wafting from the kitchen. I will definitely be back for a full meal."
0,Brought a tire bought drom them 3 months ago and they as id that i need a new tire and because my daught drove 1/2 a block on tire it voided warenty. Had another tire that my son put a plug into and didn't dike the plug so it came out. Again answer was need a new tire it couldn't be repaired. It still jas full tred? Scam sham. I knownew tires is where the money is; however honoring a warranty keeeps people that buy six tires in a year coming back.
1,"If they hire some an additional server and another cook, I'll bump my review up to five stars.  The food, especially the variety of curry dishes, is quite tasty and gives you some serious bang for your buck.  When my colleagues and I go here for lunch, the plates are seriously cleaned off.\n\nThe issue is the service and the amount of time it takes to eat lunch here.  Let's face it, this food is pretty easy to make, and yet if a group of us wants to do lunch here we need 90 minutes, and that's ridiculous.  It's especially frustrating because this place is minutes from my office, which should make it the perfect lunch spot when you have to be back at work in an hour.\n\nSo, very good food and great value, but far too slow...  If you have the time and consider yourself a patient person, give it a shot."
1,Phenomenally good healthy food.   Fresh made Baklava.   Nice ambiance and the wait staff take the time to recognize your needs.
0,"Went there last night and were completely disappointed. When we first arrived there was a wait of \""25-30 minutes\"", so we walked to the bar and got a drink. After waiting waiting 50 minutes we were finally sat. We promptly ordered our appetizers and meals and this is when the waiting really began. It took 55 minutes for our food to come and when it finally arrived at the table, the only thing that was hot were the french fries. The sandwich, pizzas and pasta were ice cold. After looking at our plates we asked our waitress (who was a great) if we could speak with the manager. The manager came out and before we could even say one thing he said, \""I just want you guys to know that all your food will be comped tonight. Our kitchen is having a terrible night so for how long it took and the quality of the food we will comp your meal\"".\n\nNow while I appreciate him for doing his job and comping our horrendous meal, I have no clue how that food even left the window. When the food looked like it had been sitting in the window for 20 minutes and someone brings it out that cold, its nothing short of ridiculous.\n\nMoral of the story is, that if you have 2.5 free hours on a Saturday night to eat insanely poor food and to get frustrated go to Wolfley's. If you want good food and tv's to watch games head elsewhere."
0,"This review is not about the food. The food at the Chipotle restaurants are generally the same in quality and taste. I have never had an issue with the taste of the food while being a consumer at this location but I have had terrible service time and time again. \n\nI work close to this location , at a company at Westgate. Myself and fellow co workers come to Chipotle often since there aren't many options in Westgate during the day at lunch time . Well, there is Buffalo Wild Wins, Which Which and Mama Gina's but everything gets really old, really fast. Chipotle has something for everyone , so we go there. \n\nThe taste of the food is fine and the portion of food provided is AMAZING if you are a 5 year old child. You order a burrito bowl and or burrito and you get 2 servings of rice , veggies and everything else by default and then when it comes to meat, you get a child portion. When you look confused and or concerned and ask for a little more they  respond by asking if you want double meat, which is an extra cost of course.  The chicken, steak and other meats are what make the meal. Not cheese, lettuce, hot sauce and beans. Those are used as fillers here. Where else do you go and spend 10 bucks for a burrito with meat in it that would better accommodate a taco?\n\nI did not want to really speak about the customer service since I will not include employee names, although I have them. Often times you leave feeling rushed. If you change your mind, please expect a roll of the eyes. Trust that someone will be upset because you as the customer want to add beans last minute. How DARE you ask for your monies worth!!?\n\nI really wish I did not have to create an account just to write this review but I had to. I have been working near this location and helping jeep them in business since January and I have been wanting to write this and or write corporate forever and just kept saying it fast food, its fine, it will get better. \n\nIt unfortunately does not, at least at this location!!!"
0,"My wife and I met a friend at Caesar's Palace. Since it was a warm day, we thought it would be a good idea to have some ice cream. He suggested that FAO toy store had some ice cream. When we got there, they apparently closed. We saw  the Cafe with a nice window display of their gelato deserts. They even let you sample any of the flavors. After deciding on the flavors, I bought 2 mediums and 1 small. I asked where to pay and was directed to go to the other counter. Since I needed some change, I decided to break my $100 bill. Got to the register and was surprised to see my total add to over $54!!! The pricing was a small sign next to the register. I should have kept the receipt, but was so angry that I threw it away. The $5 one scoop ice cream in Maui (previous vacation) was a bargain!"
0,"Wish I could give this place a good review, having eaten there multiple times but today it was just too much. There were four people ahead of me, two couples who all placed large orders. I watched one couple get the wrong order three times, they were still there when I walked out. It didn't seem like the cashier knew his head from a hole in the ground and constantly kept asking people what they had ordered. In the end I never got my food, which I had paid for, and just walked out as I had spent my entire lunch break waiting. I won't say avoid this place entirely, just avoid them around the lunch hour. They will leave you waiting."
1,"I lived in Summerlin until recently, and my family loved to eat at this buffet. Price- Great\nAtmosphere- Good\nFood- Very Good\nWaitresses- very friendly"
1,You get more than your moneys worth here. Food is delicious.
1,"Love this place! Lunch with clients, or lunch with my husband. Has been excellent every time! Try the Settebello Special, it is the best. Fresh ingredients, great crust, and the flavor is amazing."
1,"Well folks, I think I have officially converted to the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (CBTL) from Starbucks which I was confirmed to their goldcard status in 2008. I don't know, I guess I grew up and figured out what I want my beliefs to be and that path has lead me to CBTL. Well, really it was the path from my house, which is nearby, making this my most convenient coffee shop, but I was just trying to be dramatic...\n\nAnyhoo, I am a sucker for americanos and the espresso that they pour here is not bitter at all compared to what I am used to. I would agree with a previous review that it is sweeter than Sbucks, but I think anything would be, they are just bitter. When I really want a treat I get some of their no sugar added vanilla powder which really makes it taste sweet. I love their wide assortment of teas and while I have not tried any, I know I will and appreciate all the options I have ahead of me. The staff is always pleasant, the drinks come out pretty quick, and the condiment bar is always clean. There are about 6 tables inside and several outside, which on the weekends turns into a dog friendly patio, love it! \n\nI can't wait for Fall and Winter to take advantage of their patio while enjoying my coffee!"
0,"Intimate restaurant seats about 70. Neat but a bit over priced, steaks were not great, and $70/ person for 2 sodas 1 bottle of average wine with the meal and no desserts. We wouldn't go back."
0,great service.. not the best i've ever had.. a bit pricey.. it was 150.00 per person for a party of 6.. they sat us by the window which had a great view.. the hostesses were really pretty.. oysters were great.. nothing else was that impressive..
1,"I did the half this year and am looking forward to doing it again in January.  Nice big expo with plenty of different vendors.  Also tons of Rock n Roll gear that you can buy.  They're offering a tech tee instead of a regular t-shirt as the participant's tee next year, so that's something new to look forward to.  Flat course that can get a little boring at times, but that's what the bands and cheerleaders are for - they really help to keep you going.  I love the Rock and Roll medals and am working to collect more!"
0,"Seriously upset with this venue. I bought VIP tickets to see Young the Giant because I wanted to avoid the lines and get in before everyone, which is listed as one of the bonuses when you buy the ticket... And I have witnessed this happen before at other shows. But it turns out that we didn't get in before everyone else did and I spent the extra $50 for nothing. The 'VIP section' was filled with parents of teenage girls and totally pointless because it is beside the stage. I am very disappointed."
1,"I think I found my new favorite Thai place, and it's in walking distance to my house! Hooray! I've only tried the chicken pad thai. It wasn't as sweet as other places but I don't like things that are too sweet. I asked for a little spicy and holy cow, talk about spicy! Again, very much enjoyed. Other reviews said the Thai iced tea was a must and that is solid advice; the drink was smokey and sweet and I'm wishing I had another one right now. Also, the portion size was huge so I'll be enjoying the pad thai for the next day or two. \n\nDon't be fooled by the run down, cheesy, Las Vegas style strip mall that Lemongrass is in; this place is tasty!"
0,"Why the hell did they put IMAX here?\n\nArizona Mills has vastly decreased in integrity over lets say the past 3 years (ever since Krispy Kreme Doughnuts took a turn for the worse), many of the stores have left and been replaced by generic stores such as the one that sells multiple versions of doctors/nurses scrubs.\n\n\nNow with the departure of the Virgin Megastore this mall is officially dead to me.\n\nedit: Don't bring your 30k+ car to this mall, it will get stolen or end up with a barrage of door dings. You can thank the non-existent security."
0,"I would like to thank the smog tech for farting in my car before he got out and rolled the windows up. Other than this I'd say they have quite fast, can't say friendly service because everyone looked miserable and only said the things they had to, but then again how long does it really take to get a smog? Would have had 5 stars but my car smelt miserable after I got it back, staff don't greet you like a normal business should, you just get the \""hey, what you need?\"" I paid, the tech have me my receipt then called the next person. No thank you, have a nice day, see you next time, thanks for coming, we appreciate your business. I assume jiffy lube corporate reads these so take those example phrases and utilize it in some training. Second, maybe you should pay your staff more they really look miserable at this location......Thanks for the gift (fart)!!"
1,"Oxtail fries. Just shut up and order them. Don't question it, just get them. Your meal and your overall quality of life will be better once you eat them.\n\nAnyway, I love this place. It's right down the street from my house and definitely holds a special place in all of our hearts. \n\nMy first time going there I got the Ronin burger, which I definitely recommend. It's delicious. It's salty, sweet, crunchy, soft, juicy, tangy, refreshing, gooey, and messy. It's everything you want in a burger. \n\nSeriously, Bachi burger is great. It's got a cool vibe inside, they have a good beer selection and a great menu of delicious, un-pretentious food. \n\nJust go there."
0,"This shop is everything that a pipe collector could want. The shop keepers however, are smug and condescending.  They spoke down to me and seemed very put out that I was even in the store. I like to shop at local establishments but after this experience I will be buying my pipes on line.  Plus, they both speak like Mr. Howell from Gilligan's island, pretentious and fake.  Great selection, but you can find the same for cheaper online without the insulting clerks."
0,"I have a hard time believing the stellar Yelp reviews this show gets; \nAbsinthe is the most insipid Vegas offering I've ever seen. The hosts lack any charm to make their mocking of audience members and extreme potty humor palatable. The routine is an uninspired Sacha Baron Cohen and Sarah Silverman rip-off. If you don't like those comedians -- and even if you do, perhaps -- you will not like the show. The acrobats were, at best, Cirque du Soliel castoffs or rejects. \nI had a friend present at the show the night before where a performer on the high-wire crashed into the audience and knocked some guy in the head with the balance bar. That part of the show was dropped from the show we attended on Friday Nov. 4, 2011. No great loss, I'm sure. \nWe didn't stay through to the end. Spare yourself the agony of having to pretend you like the show because you paid as much as you did for the tickets. You'd be better off mindlessly dumping your cash into some slots while staring into the middle distance."

0,"If I could give zero stars I would. This show was terrible. I would have rather put the money I spent on the tickets into a hopeless slot machine. Superstars were unrealistic, and did not look like real singers. Overall, this show was a bust."
1,"Very urban chic! Their chai tea latte is one of the best I've had in Vegas. Their breakfast items are over-priced, especially since their bagels are supermaket Sara Lee brand; however, they have a honey-butter they serve with them that absolutely makes up for it."
0,"A group of 7 families decided to book a family stay-cation for the Fourth of July at the Marriott Tempe Buttes for the first time.  The property is beautiful and well maintained, the check in staff were very friendly and helpful. The pool attendant Krystina was the absolute best. However- we did have some very serious service related issues with our stay: 1.  The main reason for staying at the Buttes was to spend the day at the pool so the kids could play on the water slide.  By the end of the day the little ones all looked like they had been used as whipping posts from the bruises and scrapes left from a too-dry water slide. ALL of the kids had multiple bruises and scrapes on their little backsides and backs.  That is unacceptable! A total safety issue that needs to be rectified.  2. Prior to arrival, we had checked with the front desk to clear snacks and water bottles at the pool.  Once given the go-ahead we pack the standard: water bottles, goldfish, popcorn, etc. Upon entering the pool our bags were searched for alcohol.  Anytime the pool manager walked by our area, our bags were searched again.  This happened SEVERAL times.  I can see searching once for due diligence- but after the second or third round- it was frustrating, humiliating and embarrassing. We didn't even stay pool side long enough to watch the fireworks from the pool due to the whole situation. Spent $145/night to sit in the hotel room.  3. Although I love a good party, and can not fault the staff for noise levels of guests due to celebration, it took 3 calls from 11pm-3am for staff to finally knock on neighbors door and insist on quiet.  Definitely not my best hotel experience. I honestly do not see myself going back to a Marriott property anytime soon.  Normally I will give a place a second or third chance before bashing them online, but this whole experience was incredible- in the worst possible way."
0,"I needed a car inspection so I called to find out the closing time. It's 6:00, I but was told they actually start closing up at 5:50. I was going to arriving very close to 5:50 so I said that I would just have the inspection done on the following day. The next day I arrived at 5:30 and was told that the inspector had already gone home for the day.\n\nDon't waste your time."
0,"I have stayed here twice in as many years around an event my company puts on, and this review will be an amalgam of both experiences.\n\nWhat sticks out in my mind about my first visit was the check-in.  I pulled up front, and followed the signs to self-parking (I refuse to valet, it's just ludicrous).  It was quite a trek from the parking to the front desk, and after 3 1/2 hours of driving and having been up for 28 hours at this point, I was not feeling that.  \n\nSo, we checked in and were told we were in the Paradise tower - though the other half of our team was in the HRH tower.  We had a bellhop come and help us with our considerable luggage and set off on the 9-mile hike from the front desk to our room in the Paradise tower.  Of course, it was the very last room on the floor, and since the self parking I was directed to was adjacent to the HRH tower, I was as far as humanly possible from my car while still being on the same property.  \n\nAt the room at last, we go in and are greeted by an oppressive heat, and a single King sized bed.  Being on a business trip with a fellow heterosexual male, this was simply not going to work.  We called down to the front desk to get it all sorted.  We asked at that time, since we were going to have to switch rooms anyway, could we relocate to the HRH tower to be nearer to our coworkers and were told there was nothing available in that tower, but we would get another room in this same tower, and they would send the bellhop with the keys and luggage cart.\n\n30 minutes later (a wait yes, but remember the distance from the front desk is ridiculous), we were on our way to our new room.  When we arrived I noticed an 'All tied up' sign on the door (I later learned this is their DND sign), still we opened the door only to discover a young couple mid-coitus.  Yes, they had assigned us to an occupied room.  \n\nBy this time we were extremely frustrated and exhausted.  We went all the way BACK to the front desk, raised a little hell, and eventually got a room in the HRH tower (yes the one with no availability) right across the hall from our co-workers.  Ok cool, though why we were lied to earlier, I still don't know.\n\nThe room itself had a cool aesthetic, but it was all just a veneer.  The appointments were cheap and kind of tacky, and you could see some things were already falling apart.  \n\nThat brings us to the second trip.  This time around, the check-in was much smoother, and we got the right room on the first try, again in the Paradise tower.  A fairly average room, our one big complaint was that the beds are just waaaaaaaaaaaaaayyy too soft.  I know there are some people who like that, but I really think they should cater to the middle.  Also, the closet in which they place the toilet and shower is joke.  Additionally, on the first night, I was so dehydrated that I splunked down for a $7.50 1L bottle of Smart Water.  I still had a bout a third of it left sitting on the nightstand the next morning.  When we came back to the room, the maid had removed it!  WTF?!?!  There was still like $3 worth of water in there.  Bad form, very very bad form. \n\n\nThe rating overall reflects my frustration with the service on our first stay, the overall lack of attention to detail, the inconvenient location with respect to the strip, and the 'we are trying too hard to be cool' vibe that permeates the place.\n\nI think you can do better."
1,"The service at MBGFR is simply fabulous. The waitresses are always on their best behavior and aim to please.  \n\nI personally recommend the tzatziki as a starter, although I'd just as soon eat the pita by itself. I've never been given pita that wasn't fresh and scalding hot. \n\nMost of the menu allows you to add a Greek salad for $2. Other menu items allow you to substitute it in lieu of seasoned fries for no additional charge. Whatever the cost, I recommended getting the Greek salad with your meal. It is infinitely excellent. \n\nPersonally I recommend the gyro wrap. \n\nAnd the Baklava is so good you'll want to pick it apart.\n\nIt's perfect for a light, healthy brunch."
1,"Great place, excellent selection, very casual.  Not an upscale cigar bar but still great environment to unwind."
1,The ambience and the decor are good.  Classic and relaxing.  The complimentary bread and cappuccino are great.  The flavor are a little bit light.  With the complimentary red and White House wine is still a place worth to come for family and date.
0,Horrible service and horrible food. The seafood pasta was under cooked and had a very fishy taste. The chicken marsala tasted like chicken teriyaki from a cheap Chinese restaurant. Worst chicken marsala ever!!!! Do not eat here. Even their bread came out cold with their cold red sauce for dipping.
1,"just ate there the other day and i was very happy with the service they provided after there was some confusion about what i had ordered, they sent it back it, fixed it, and it was delicious. smash burger is not the healthiest of places since it has a lot of grease but it does hit that hang over spot."
0,"Good gosh this place is hard to find! It's literally tucked away in the back of the shopping center! I don't even know how people would find this place without yelp and a gps.\n\nThe decor is quite classic English pub style and the service is charming. Sadly I find the food here a bit lacking after having been here twice. The first time I had the fish and chips which were good if a bit boring. The fries weren't as crisp as I would like and under seasoned. The fish batter on the other hand was delightfully crispy but also lacking some flavor. Salt is your friend! My second time here I had the Guinness stew, maybe my palate is not very good but it just tasted like canned beef stew to me. The best part of the dish were the vegetables on top of it. On the plus side drinks are cheap, and the patrons are friendly."
0,"Expensive meal that still hasn't come after an hour and forty minutes. Made reservations in the early afternoon, and the table wasn't ready in time. When we were finally brought to the table, it still wasn't ready and we had to stand around while they prepared it. Took one hour for a salad to arrive. Waitress never checked in on the table, completely disappeared and never offered us bread or water. No one talked to us. Awful."
0,"Did anyone else see the 1-800 number on the sign during the performance? 2/3 of the way through...one of the characters carried a sign across the furthest point back on the stage. The sign read 1-800-724-HOTT (or something similar). \n\nReally? I just paid $250 for tickets and spotted a very subtle ad for a sex hotline in the middle of the show. I don't know, I was shocked, but I certainly wasn't the only one who saw it. It just seems sickening to think of how much tickets cost, and yet the company is still seeking out ad revenue.\n\nAnd just as reference, the sign was the exact same size, style and print as the \""Applaud\"" sign that shows up near the end of the show. And carried by the same character, only on the front part of the stage, not the back.\n\nOtherwise, the performance was spectacular. \n\nThe \""limited view\"" seating does save you a good chunk of money. I chose this option. The seats we sat in were just barely, BARELY blocked by a hand railing. You can see the view from the seat on the Bellagio website, but I guarantee you will be happy having saved the money, still sitting closer to the front, and seeing a bit of guard rail on the stage. It's worth the savings by far."
1,"Cheapest theatre in town, 5 bucks before 2pm...even for new releases..\nI wont see movies anywhere else!"
1,"Cinco de Mayo pretty much means eat tacos for lunch and have a margarita. So we headed to Taco Haus to indulge in the festivities. We sat on their shaded, mister covered patio even though the temps were in the high 90's we were very comfy! The specials of the day were clearly posted so we ordered a corona and a house margarita ($4 each), it was delicious, a perfect mix! The chips, guac, and salsa were all tasty and fresh, I loved the salsa verde! I ordered the carne asada taco plate with cilantro rice and lentils (I prefer the traditional black bean, but interesting spin) and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the short rib taco plate (the best short rib tacos I've ever had)! We were easily persuaded to finish off our lunch with the carrot cake and holy deliciousness! I highly recommend supporting the Haus restaurants! Always a nice atmosphere, good service, and amazing food!"
0,"$35 just to pack some clothes I bought at the mall. This does not include the $16 to ship. Look for a box and pack it yourself. Use UPS if the box will be large and heavy, otherwise, USPS or FEDEX Ground is way cheaper. Boxes can be found by asking the housekeeper or the maintenance guy. The store you bought the stuff will have boxes too. Take a roll of shipping tape or buy it at the PO or any drug store for $3.99."
1,Highly recommend this  tiny place and the tasting menu. Very friendly staff and a cool variety of rolls. PS: The Christmas trees are amazing.
0,"I think you should go to this restaurant. Just know ahead of time that it's strange. The charcuterie platter was quite expensive for what it is, just a bit of meat, two kinds of cheese, blue and WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!?!?\nThe \""other\"" cheese is the worst cheese either of us had ever tasted. The wonderfully cheery waitress chimed in \"" oh, we agree! When they bring it in, we hold our noses and avoid it\"". It is referred to as a \""cave aged sheep's milk\"". Well, the maker needs to get a flashlight and go check their cave cuz I think there's a dead emu decomposing in it.\nDuck fat fries: Lovely! \nNo ketchup for the fries: Idiots. You know, you could make your own artisanal ketchup, guys. Alice Waters has a recipe in her \""Tailgating\"" cookbook. I wonder how many times a day they get asked for this obvious condiment.\n\nDessert: Fried ricotta donuts in chocolate sauce. 5 Stars.\n\nSo, all in all, this is a hipster enterprise extraorinaire. They are full of themselves, as great artists often are. Just be prepared to pay for someone else's flights of fancy in a pretty environment.elps others learn about great local businesses.\n\nPlease don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."
0,I am new to Las Vegas and looking for a hair salon.  I bought a Groupon for this particular salon and made an appointment - I had to cancel and did so 3 days prior to the appointment.  I tried to reschedule the appointment and I left messages for over a week with no call back or a full voice mail box.  I left 5 voice mail messages and 1 message with the stylists 'assistant' who promised a call back the next day- it never came.  I can appreciate that you are busy - but if you don't have time to return phone calls for over a week perhaps it's time to stop taking Groupons and catch up. I contacted Groupon and they refunded my purchase.
1,I like Redbeards.  The patio is nice and provides a fun ambiance for Shiloh Street...\n\nHappy Hour specials are good.  I've had their mozzarella sticks which are massive but good.  I haven't gone here on a weekend night.  Bartenders are nice and so are the waitresses.\n\nOnly downfall:  they need a website.
1,"I just had some maintenance to my 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee and they were very helpful and the service was excellent.  I cannot comment on whether it was a competitive price because I did not shop around. However with the convenience of taking my vehicle there, and they providing me transportation back home and to the shop was great.  The customer service was excellent. I'll always pay a few dollars extra for excellent customer service!"

0,"Food is still Chicken Bonz but the prices have gotten ridiculous no combos and \""the home of all you can eat wings everyday\"" is now only on tuesday plus the price went up.  Besides, this new name/place sounds like a sex club or something. BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL CHICKEN BONZ!!"
0,"The pizza was horrible. It was very undercooked, doughy and really unpleasant to eat. The salad & the pasta were ok. Service was slow and the staff was not friendly. Very disappointed as we were hoping for a good pizza place near home. We won't be back."
0,"Blech. The saltiest Mexican style food I've ever had - worse than places like Baja Fresh. I had the fajita burrito with chicken. If you like salty, give it a try; I won't be repeating it."
0,"Wasn't the best by far. I got a Coco soup which was flavorful, almost too flavorful but nice pieces of white meat chicken. Also got the Garlic Shrimp and I was expecting the typical Garlic Shrimp with a thick sauce. This came drenched in liquid and the shrimp were very chewy. I ate two bites and could not eat anymore. If I ever come back to Phoenix, I will not order delivery from here again. Disappointed!"
1,"Been coming to this place in mornings and on lunch breaks almost going on three years now and was quite happy to know that this location was not selected for closing, unlike the ones Park Road and East Boulevard. Coffee is excellent, all of the time. Staff are marvelous, friendly, and know people by name (as well as learn your orders and take them before paying, if you come often enough). The breakfast foods (i.e. oatmeal, biscuits) I've ordered on occasion and liked them. Keep up the great work Caribou."
0,"Very poor service. Food is slightly above average for a typical brunch place. Restaurant is grimy along the walls. This place used to be great for brunch, but you can tell the owners have really allowed it to settle into mediocrity. They have also botched two take-out orders recently - made me wait 45 minutes once and completely messed up the second time.\n\nAlso, don't get the lobster salad - made a family member sick for two days.\n\nAvoid and go elsewhere for brunch."
0,"After reading about Crepe Expectations in Desert Companion we decided to try it.  My husband ordered the Chorizo and Egg Crepe and it was a thick, gooey crepe with loads of ground chorizo and very little egg in sight.  He could only eat half of it. Mine was a strawberry crepe and the same thick gooey crepe with a bland flavor except for the chocolate sauce on top.  The $4.50 \""fresh\"" oj seemed like it was from concentrate and the latte was lukewarm.  And, the service was slow.  All in all, it was a disappointing breakfast."
1,"Let me first start by saying that I am only through the process of putting my dress on layaway. So, I can't speak for quality as I haven't worn it for any length of time. I did thoroughly inspect it and am very pleased.\n\nI was thrilled today when I was able to find a dress in my size as I'm a plus-size bride. Not only did I find one, but there was a large selection in my size and I loved a couple of them. Shocking! I don't usually have many choices. \n\nI had called ahead and made my appointment and asked if they had an assortment of dresses in my size in. She said they did and was very kind. I advised her I've been reading horror stories online about plus sized girls being treated poorly, etc by stores and attendants. She assured me that would not be the case. \n\nIt most certainly wasn't. My specialist was amazing. I picked out three I liked hanging on the rack. It's hard to tell what they look like til you have them out and on. I liked one, thought it might be it. Quickly ruled out the other two. Then, she said WAIT, and went and got one that had just come in. It slid on with ease and felt amazing. She knew based on all the information I had given her what I was looking for. \n\nI cannot stress enough how pleasantly surprised I am. \n\nI would advise any bride call ahead as I did. It just gives them the heads up to be extra nice to you if you express concern before hand.\n\nAs someone else mentioned there was no big upsell. No pressure. She told me there was sale on the dress I wasn't aware of. She seemed genuinely interested in my happiness. \n\nWIN!"
0,"So disappointing.  Maybe it's because I came for brunch.\n\nI go to Vegas often and I remember the Bellagio buffet being one of the best on the strip.  Perhaps its been too long since I've eaten there. \n\nI went there for the Champagne brunch this past Sunday and it was crap.  There was nothing special.  It was just the usual cocktail shrimp, so-so sushi rolls, and regular buffet food.  No crab legs.  No \""special\"" dishes.  It was all omelets, salad, pasta, pizza.  I might as well have eaten at the Circus Circus buffet or Sizzler.\n\nKeep in mind, I like food and am highly critical.  When I hear \""Bellagio\"", I think fabulous.  Their buffet did not deliver.\n\nThe Bellagio is a beautiful hotel and its such a shame that their food quality has gone down so low.  While I definitely appreciate the server making sure that my Champagne glass was always full, the food left much to be desired."
1,"This store is so FUN!!!! We had a 70's party to go to, and this was our second stop in search of an authentic outfit..... We were so happy with what we found, there was no need to check out any other store (btw, there are a TON of vintage clothing shops in this area...)\n\nThe staff was VERY helpful and friendly! I had no idea what I was doing, or what to look for, the girl there helped me out a lot by putting together like 10 outfits for me in only 2 minutes! I found my outfit after only trying on two of the 10 pieces she found for me...it was love at first sight! My husband found an outrages blue tuxedo, with a hot shirt to go with. We walked out happy as can be with Brady Bunch tunes in our head. :D\n\nBesides retro clothing, you will find some shoes (mostly womens, and not a huge selection) hats, bags, jewelry, furniture, and lots of odds and ends things.....It's fun to just browse around. (btw, prices are VERY reasonable!)\n\nOh, after you visit Retro Ranch, don't forget to stop at Lux, just around the corner, to celebrate your far out finds!"
1,"This place was amazing.  I love thai food, but this is the first place that was really interesting, and had more than the typical dishes.  I had a beef tartar that was SO spicy.  I asked for a solid 9/10 on the spice, and boy did it melt my face.  The server could see my tears of joy and pain, so brought a little bit of a sweet white wine to cool my mouth down.\n\nAfter scooping what was left of my face off the table, I had some of my gf's dish.  It was a seafood curry thing that was amazing as well."
0,"Dining out is about more than just the food! \n\nTook a 20 min. drive to try this restaurant because I had a coupon, and wanted to see what chicken and waffles was all about. We went early Sunday, about 5pm and were the only patrons in the place. There are two doors to enter-the first gets you into a vestibule which, sadly, set the tone for our experience. There was some construction related materials (bucket and cords) just laying there! Really! Why would you leave those there? We were taken to a window seat with a view of the parking lot in one direction and behind us a hallway to the kitchen with a trash can and a vacuum cleaner sitting there in full view. Wall, table and room decor is non-existent. Do they just not see what their customers are seeing?\n\nWe ordered the chicken breast and waffle and enjoyed both. The chicken was nicely seasoned, nice and crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, not at all greasy, and was a good sized portion. The waffle was good too. Our side of greens was okay-not much flavor and floating in a lot of water.\n\nThe service was very attentive, and our server showed us around the rest of the restaurant where they have a bar and showroom-they bring in comedians, musicians and a DJ on selected nights. It looks to have a great layout for shows.\n\nWhen I have guests in my home for dinner, the very least I do is clean up! Julie's ought top do the same, and while they are at it, add a little decor to make the experience more inviting."
0,"This is an overdue review for one of the worst experiences ever in Vegas!\n\nSo a pack of us are in Sin City for \""Frozen Fury\"" to watch the Kings play Colorado.  Emotions were riding high since the Kings won and was going to be my buddy's first time at a Strip Club!\n\nWe stroll in grab seats and enjoy the festivities.  Hot chicks everywhere so I slowly drift off into Candyland...ahhhhhh.  Little did I know that the wolves were slowly working on one young pup.  A dancer came over and whispered into the \""Pup\"" ears and off he went to the VIP room.\n\n3-6-8 Songs later...I ask...\""Where's Puperoni\"".  Of course, the others in the pack ignored me.   Songs continue....chi chis are bouncing.....\"" Hey C...where is your boy??\"".  C gets up and heads to the VIP room.  Bouncer stops him from entering and tells him he cant go in.  By then, our group heads to see what's up.\n\nAt some point, the Dancer was able to get the \""Pup's\"" credit card and racked up a bill for $990 and took him for $170 in cash.  WTF!  Okay, now maybe it was at least 10 songs with full nudity, but how do rack up $1000 for lap dances???  BullSh*t!\n\nMy buddy's pup signed the credit card receipt so there was nothing to contest except that our young apprentice got taken.  Little \""Sparky\"" has a crappy job making $9 an hour, so this $1000+ lesson should be around for quite a while.  \n\nI had a great time, venue was cool but do the \""Little Darlings\"" at Little Darlings have to feed on the young.  I was also taught that \""you get more bees with honey\"".  I guess not.  \n\nNot sure if I would ever go back.  If you provide a wild and exciting time, the boys will come, however, this was all shady.  Definitely rubbed me the wrong way.  You only get one star cause I can't give you less...but then again you already took what you could.\n\nAdvice, watch your young or leave the pups at home.  There are tons of other places to go in Vegas.  Next time, I will recommend to stay in CA and call up the girls from Ashley Entertainment."

0,"My husband and I decided to try Cibo as it was part of a \""discount card\"" fundraiser we had signed up for & when I looked at their website/menu online, they identified themselves as \""gluten free friendly\"" and more than happy to accommodate any allergy/dietary needs and as a GF girl, anytime an Italian place says they have GF pasta, I'm pretty happy! We dined on a Saturday evening, with reservations. \n\nI usually try and keep it pretty positive when it comes to reviewing restaurants but our experience was the complete opposite of positive and I hope some changes can be made their in the future because their food had some great elements & their owner was nice but other than that....ugh. \n\nWhen I mentioned that I am GF and asked if I could get the Chicken Parm but without breadcrumbs (which I would normally not even think to ask for but since they had identified themselves as being willing to accomodate allergies I went ahead and asked), I was told the chef \""is busy and wouldn't want to do that but that he could just put some grilled chicken on top of the pasta but she didn't want to ask him to make it \""parmesan\"" style, even though I'm pretty sure that would just consist of putting some sauce and cheese on top. I can understand when things are busy it is hard to accomodate special requests (even simple ones like mine) but as a customer (who is paying $20 + for dinner), I don't think I should have to worry about if my order will stress the chef out. Either don't claim to be GF friendly or get some more kitchen help? In the end, I ended up paying a pretty high price for noodles, marinara sauce & grilled chicken :( \n\nOur waitress only smiled when she was dropping off the check & we only smiled when we could finally leave."
0,"There is only one pro about this place; which is that it is decently priced. However there are negatives that out way the positives. For one, when handing your car to the service men where they take your car to clean; they do clean your car, however there are still smudges and dirt on your car. Secondly, they mess with the inside of your car, such as changing the seats, and the stick shift fear (which I do not touch); which is very annoying because you want the car the way you are driving  and everything inside the car is messed up of the way you left it. For me, that is a big deal when they treat your car like they own your car and they can do what they want."
0,"the bakery is okay but the service is terrible; went in on Saturday to pick up a cake I paid for and ordered on Tuesday; Waited 40 minutes and then when they finally got to me they said they had not started on the cake yet! I waited 40 minutes and there were only 2 people ahead of me. 3 employees walked by and did not aknowledge the wait; They told me to come back (too bad I pre-paid for the cake) and did not apologize, just went to the next customer; there are much better European bakeries in N. Central such as Karl's or Jana's that are better bakeries and better in service"
1,"Good, old school, Italian deli.  I had the Roma cold deli sandwich with imported prosciutto, very delicious! Fresh homemade bread with olive oil, very tasty!"
1,"Good food. Good prices. Good specialty bar drinks. One of the better 'chain' steak joints, for the price."
0,"...over rated...\nThe sonoma grilled chicken salad was a huge disappointment with a mere ounce of chicken, and heavily oiled greens (in spite of the requested dressing on the side).  The 45 minute wait at off peak was sooo not worth it. If you give your phone number to be on the wait list, be prepared for a slew of annoying text messages."
1,"Best deal for shoe repair! I've been trying to get my boots resoled but didn't have it in me to pay $50+ bucks that they charge everywhere else. I stumbled in here and they happily fixed up in a day for a mere $12.\n\nI mean this was after their painfully awkward attempt at small talk ...\""so you have family in Japan?\"" and \""you go to the gym a lot?\""... but I'll bear that much for a $12 fix up"
0,"I also wrote this same review under just Dr. Hunt, but I figured I should also put it on their office to review as well. \n\nI have a very detailed review regarding my experience with Dr. Hunt and her staff on google and Angie's list, however, I am limited on my space, so I will only tell the basics.\n\nI had been a patient of Dr. Hunt's office for over 4 years. Dr. Hunt even delivered my 1st baby. Until I was pregnant, I never saw the same Dr. or NP twice in a row. Once I became pregnant, I mostly saw just Dr. Hunt (besides 2 times because she wasn't in). Throughout the years the waiting time got longer and longer. Almost every time I went in, the waiting room was full. There were times I waited up to an hour and 15 minutes, while I was pregnant. There were also times that I had to reschedule because they had over booked their patients and I didn't have the time to wait because I had to go back to work. Basically, they seemed to be very unorganized.\n\nThe staff were friendly, but very incompetent and had lack of communication.It makes sense why they had such a high turnover, and even then, they couldn't get it right. I can't even tell you how many messages I had left with no avail, which is what ultimately led to me finally finding another Doctor.\n\nDr. Hunt is a very knowledgeable doctor, however, she lacks the bed side manner that most women want in an Ob/gyn. She comes off very passive and, at times, very insincere.\n\nIt turns out, that if you have any questions or concerns and Dr. Hunt is not \""available\"", whether it be her day off or she's out of town, you are to wait until her return.This had happened to me on numerous occasions. Not even her medical assistant, Anne, is able to get a hold of her and/or answer you questions, nor does she know how to return phone calls. Finally, after much frustration, I spoke to Dr. Hunt. I was thinking that once I spoke to Dr. Hunt, I would express my concerns and she would make me feel better. To my surprise, she did the exact opposite.\n\nI addressed my frustration regarding receiving a return call when I have questions or concerns about prescribed medicine and/ or a question I may of forgot to ask while I was in there earlier that day/week, and how I didn't like that it would take me several days to get an answer. She, Dr. Hunt, proceeded to tell that, if she was off or out of town and my concerns were not \"" an emergency\"" or \""important\"", that I had to wait. I expressed my confusion and told her that I was shocked how she ran her office. It was then, with a very matter-of-fact attitude, she said to me \"" maybe it's time you find another doctor\"". Shocked, I told her, I planned to. I was in a bit of dis-belief that she was quick to shoo me as a patient, as well as, the fact that she had no regard to my concerns or the obvious problems within her office.\n\nI have since found another doctor, which I really like, but I am upset that I stayed with Dr. Hunt for so long. I trusted her. I let her deliver my baby. I should've found another doctor earlier, but to be honest, I didn't want to look for a new one once I became pregnant, which is when things in her office, really, became an issue.  \n\nThis was, by far, the worst experience I have had with any kind of doctor. Lessened learned. I,now, do my homework when looking for doctors, which is how I found my new doctor, and hope it will help YOU to find a good doctor as well."
0,"Stopped in while engagement ring shopping with my fiancee's sister. Was greeted buy a guy with lots of unsightly tattoos and big hoops in his ear, not exactly the type of person to sell jewelry but I kept an open mind. We asked to see a couple rings and their price, he slid a catalog toward us and said \""they're all in there\"". He then walked away and talked on his cell phone behind the counter toward the back. He ignored us from there. I was ready to drop thousands on a ring but couldn't get the time of day. On the way out, a lady asked if we had been helped. It's a small shop, so the service was so bad they didn't even realize someone had helped us. I said \""sort of\"" and just walked out. The staff should be ashamed of their behavior."
1,"Being a northerner, I've never heard of which wich, but now that I have, I sure wish we had some in Chicago! The sandwiches & ingredients always look and taste super fresh, which I love. We've tried this place a few times & I haven't gotten a bad sandwich yet! I'm particularly fond of the club though."
1,I wanted to purchase my first hand and was referred to Pistol Parlour by a friend who collects guns. I had no clue so I went where he said. They were very busy and I didn't know what I was looking for doing. I had a budget of about $400. Nate and Logan both assisted me finding the right weapon for the right price. It was a great experience I go back every couple of weeks to purchase ammunition. Their prices are the best I have seen and have a great staff and selection. I recommend the Pistol Parlour for all your firearm needs.
0,"Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (8 of 365).\n\nUnfortunately, this is not one of my go to places for Pho.  But it is actually good enough to go to because it's the closest place to go to for Pho without the far drive to China town.  \n\nThe soup here is kind of bland but there is actually enough taste to make you come back on a rainy day.  It's actually a plus if you're looking for low sodium I guess.  There isn't much to the broth and you definitely have to dip all your meat in some kind of sauce before you eat it.  The fried egg rolls are good though and they come with lettuce to wrap it in.\n\nIf you want good authentic Pho, I suggest making the drive out.  But if you're super hungry and you're OK with good soup that you don't have to make yourself, go to Jenni Pho."
1,"I can't believe no one has mentioned the African decor in this McDonald's.  It's different and wacky and I kind of love it.  Star!\n\nStopped here because Boy needed to use bathroom right away.  Bathroom clean.  Star!\n\nManager kind of reminds me of my nephew. Star!\n\nBoy wanted Cookies 'n Cream ice cream.  Ordered McFlurry with Oreos.  Star!\n\nBoy having fun in Playland.  Star!\n\nDude sleeping in corner with head on table.  Negative star.\n\nOther than that, it's McDonald's, so what do you expect?\n\nI haven't eaten at a McDonald's in a long time, so I was kind of surprised how hard it is to read the menu.  What with all the new menu options and having to show calories and pictures, there is too much info to fit on the board.  I felt like I needed to sit down with a paper menu to take it all in."
0,"We went here a few weeks ago. The service was not good, the food was not good and the salsa had so much salt you could not taste anything but salt. I will not be going back."
1,"OK, let me start by saying this is a food review, not a venue review.  Haven't been for a concert yet.\n\nWhile I'm generally not a fan of grilled burritos (burritos that have been put into a panini press), the Veggie Burrito at Crescent really brought the flavor.   Good soy sauce saut\u00e9 on the veggies, good flavor on the beans and a good ratio of the two.  This is my first time there, but Crescent seems to pay attention to the details.  The tortilla was one of the best I've had in Phoenix (I want to know where they get them), and even the corn chips seemed a couple notches above ordinary.  The salsas are the same delicious salsas from El Gallo.\n\nI'll definitely be back"
1,"This place ruined all other Chinese restaurants for me. Seriously. I've eaten everything here that I can pronounce and even a couple things I can't. \n\nThe absolute MUST from this place is the tofu flower with spicy Szechuan sauce. It comes with pork or chicken in a broth of dried, fried whole chilies. It is smaller than it used to be, but still quite a lot of food. Worth every bit of pain you will feel the next day. In fact, you'll probably grow to like it. I recommend you ask for a dish of steamed broccoli (not on menu) to incorporate with the dish. \n\nOther homeruns include the seafood sizzling rice, cumin beef, Szechuan peppercorn anything, green beans and pork and the shallot beef. All so very, very good. Remember, though, when they say cumin (or any other spice/flavor), they really, really mean it. \n\nRating Scale:\n1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  \n2 Star: Risky at best. \n3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.\n4 Star: I eat here regularly if financially and calorically feasible.\n5 Star: I'm comfortable taking other chefs here."
1,"My second stay at monte carlo. I love this hotel\nIts on the strip, easy access, back entrance for valet parking, great staffs, great services, great valets, great atmosphere, ambiance people.  Its not crowded and its nice and quiet. Although we didn't get a strip view but thats okay. Giant comfy cozy king size bed non - smoking room fabulous!  2 free breakfast buffet! Yay! Affordable prices, would definitely come back and enjoy this hotel again"
1,"I'm a local, but this was my first time here. \n\nPRO: Ambiance is a major plus (live music will have that effect on you). Very 'chillaxing. During the day, the view is just beautiful. You can see all of fountain hills below the patio, and the backdrop is what most Arizonans will be proud for--the breathtaking view. The food is pretty good, not overly proportioned but just satisfying in appetite. \n \nCON: the service takes FOREVER. You're lucky if you get your food within 20 mins of ordering. And I mean at every part of my dining experience, this place is slow. The time it took for me to get my food was  long, the time it took to get a refill was extra long, and the time it took for them to bring out the check (let alone getting back your credit card), makes it not even worth it. \n\nin summary, I'd go here if I wanted to casually impress a group of friends for a good value, but be prepared to wait."
1,"Stopped in for a mid-morning breakfast and was absolutely delighted with my choice. I enjoyed the Johnnycakes (corn & chiles) with sweet rice and fried potatoes. The Johnnycakes were tender, crispy, and oh-so flavorful. The prickly pear maple syrup was smashing drenching the salty cakes. The sweet rice was like a breakfast rice & raisins dish and meshed perfectly with the savory cakes. The potatoes were crispy on the outside, cooked through within and flavored with crispy little onion slivers. The weather has become perfect for enjoying a meal outdoors - go for it!!"
1,"Love this place, we have been twice in the last week and will be headed there today.  Sushi taste fresh and ohhh so yummy.  Love the sunset roll."
1,"Roaring Fork is running their happy hour from 4 - 10 p.m. all summer long.  I hadn't been in since Robert McGrath sold the restaurant, and was in the bar two nights last week.  I had the green chili pork which still rocks.  The service was fantastic the first night.  Couldn't make a complaint even if I was in a horrible mood and looking to.  The second night, our server was unable to take our food and drink order (in the bar) at the same time. That being said, they haven't changed the menu or tried to cut any corners on quality since McGrath left.   I'll definitely be in soon again."
1,"I just wonder why it took me so long to find this place.  I vaguely remember looking for it one day, and never finding it.  I thought maybe I had the wrong address, my iPhone was lost, or it was to late at night after an evening of looking for the perfect drinking hole.  So I tried it several months later in the early evening, and finally found it after driving by it three times.  But it was well worth the search.\n\nI found beer heaven!!  They not only have a record number of beers on tap, they also have hundreds of beers located in large glass faced coolers so you can browse at your leisure.  More importantly you can pick and choose what beer you want and buy it in six packs to go.  \n\nThey have a large menu, which looked very good - something for everyone.  Unfortunately I was so enthralled by all the different beers, that I forgot to eat.  But from the looks of the food delivered to the people around me, it was very appetizing, and all the people seemed to enjoy it.\n\nIt is a very comfortable place - lots of wood beams, interesting decorations, and very friendly staff.  The place is really laid back, and  very easy going, although it does get loud at times.  It only adds to the atmosphere, which of course is very conducive to drinking.\n\nI am only giving this 4 stars, because I have yet to have the food.  But I will be back to try it, and, of course, to continue sampling the ever  changing variety of beers."
1,"My coworker and I decided to try Defalco's out after hearing it had been on Drive-in, Diners, and Dives. I read the reviews and knew it was best to call our orders in. Boy was I right. There was a huge line and 2 girls arguing over who was first. Exciting. \n\nMy coworker ordered the Centurion calzone and really liked it. I ordered the panini grilled cheese. I love a grilled cheese but not that one. Too salty. But we both loved the marscapone lemoncello cake. \n\nI will definitely be back to try something else. Oh and the staff was super friendly."
1,"My family and I have been enjoying Joey's for a few years now. We always get their mussels appetizer, which is phenomenal. They also bring out a basket of warm mini cornbread cakes to the table with some honey butter. It is no longer on their menu but I always order the calamari tacos which if you ask for it they will still make them. We were here yesterday during happy hour and enjoyed the great drink and appetizer specials. Our waitress was great too!"
1,"This was my home for 4 days and 3 nights, I shared it with a friend and there was plenty of room for drunken stumbling, recovery and attempting to remember what we did, who we talked to and why'd we drink like that again... \n\nThe room was a good size, with a kitchenette, microwave, sink and all the normal pots, pans, plates and flatware you'd expect in a kitchen. There was even a blender, fridge and a toaster for use. I guess these are actually high rise condos and some people live in these places. Sickness. \n\nThe shower was big, the spa tub was nice, sinks nice and the toilet was as expected. My only problem with the bathroom was that there is NO fan in the toilet area...the guy I was sharing the room with is a health nut and was taking protein powder...lemme just say....BLEH! \n\nWe stayed on the 34th floor and had a nice view of the strip during the day and night. The windows are tinted so if you're too drunk to close em the night before you aren't getting beamed in the eyes by the dreaded Vegas sun. There's complimentary Internet access so I was able to post my shenanigans on FB and let others know what type of drunken debauchery was going down. \n\nThe problem I had with the hotel was that it was a bit of a journey to get to the main hotel as well as the food areas. But other than that, the staff was helpful, the maids were nice and they don't bother you if you and a friend walk in stumbling and your friend barfs in the empty vase on display in the Lobby. \n\nFun times! I'll be back, dunno if I'll get accepted back but I'll try! : )"
1,Second time here. Love this place. Kinda tucked away and a big local hang out.  Pizza and machete bread is so yummy. Signature drinks are so good! Gteat sound system and a great place for The Walking Dead screenings. \n\nRolling Rocks $3 cant beat it. Super friendly staff and huge fans of horror flicks. Such a great time.\n\nAppocalypse pizza is the best with their dough shipped in from Boston. Love love love it!\n\nBartender Chris is such a cool cat. Owners are usually here and are also super friendly.  We need a place like this in southern California.
1,Not a fan of a $10 cover. But it was a saturday night and I was on vacation and the scene was worth it. Dancing upstairs and downstairs. Drinks were reasonably priced.
1,"I was introduced to Togo's by my boyfriend, orginially from California. I love sandwiches so of course, I was excited to try a new place. It's about a 10 minute drive from his house (about 20 minutes from mine) so we decide to head over from his place on a sunday afternoon. To my delight, it just happens to be my favorite sandwich as the daily special (turkey and avocado). How awesome!! We decide to order two sandwiches each, one for now and then one for later since the prices are great for the daily special. The sourdough bread is great but a little hard to eat so if you're looking for a softer bread, I'd go with the parmesean. Similar to subway, you are able to add your own toppings but cheese is extra. Sandwiches are stuffed full of goodies and just thinking about it makes me want to eat one now!!\n\nThe only negative (for me at least) is that it seems to take a long time for them to make the sandwiches. So, if you're in a hurry, I'd call ahead to order or just plan to be there a little while. My boyfriend and I now dub \""Togos\"" as our sunday afternoon treat spot and have been several times since it opened. Staff is extremely friendly and the place is spotless. Totally love and will keep coming back!!"
1,"I've been a @HiltonHHonors member for years and in my opinion they are one of the better loyalty programs.\n\nIf you want to have a grand vacation in Vegas, the Grand Vacations Suites may be your place.  If you prefer not to be in a casino, where you have to wander through crowds of smoky, smelly humanity to get to the strip, I recommend this hotel.\n\nIt is a bit removed from the heart of the strip so grab a cab or spring for the double-decker bus deal and ride where you wanna go.\n\nSolid, comfy, nice.  When you want a nice place to stay, not just a place to crash after you stagger in from your Vegas bender."
1,Was just in Tempe for a bowl game and found this great place thanks to other yelpers. My husband and I loved the pizza. My husband is really picky about this pizza and he raved about it. It is tucked a way but we plugged the address into our navigation system and had no problem finding it. If you are in Phoenix definitely skip the pizza chains and try Classic Italian Pizza.
1,"Best steak experience ever!!!! This is definitely a splurge type place if you are lucky to be in a town that actually has one. Service got a little shaky towards the end of our meal but it was terribly busy, being that it was Saturday night on Valentine's day weekend. Five stars does this place the justice it deserves for both the ambiance and top notch food quality! Would do it all over again if I had the chance!"
0,"As a friend said: this place is great for takeout. Great food, but the service is terrible. I've given this place two good chances but it's slow slow slow. They either need more servers and cooks or just more competent servers and cooks. Be prepared to wait an hour for your food. Once you get it it's delicious, though, and the atmosphere almost makes waiting so long bearable. Nevertheless, I won't be going back to dine in."
1,"I love college kids' old clothes! I swear, they throw out perfectly good items. Or it could be that when they put on the freshmen 15, they can't fit into their duds anymore. Either way...good for me!\n\nThis store is extremely well organized. I love that quality in a thrift store. Jeans with jeans, sweaters with sweaters. The clothes are in really good shape too. I hardly saw a hole in the whole store! I ended up with 2 pairs of great jeans (which are typically hard to find in thrift stores) and 2 new-to-me shirts. Success!\n\nThe feel of the store is funky. The employees are cool, the music is cool, the clothes are cool. The storefront is situated on State Street pedestrian \""mall\"" which I recommend for a casual stroll, eat, and shop destination. I can't wait for my next trip up to Madison so I can visit this store again."
1,"I heard this place was a Vegas favorite and wanted to try it years ago but I guess it closed down for some time.  I was pleasantly surprised to see it on Yelp recently to find that it was back.  My family loved it.  The custard is wonderfully creamy and delicious.  Everyone loved what they ordered.  We all ordered some type of sundae so we didn't try anything other than their standard vanilla custard so I look forward to trying some of their other flavors on our next trip to Vegas.\nBefore dessert, do yourself a favor and visit the taco truck next door for dinner."
1,"6.30am. On my way home from a truly ridiculous festival night out. Yes home. Oooh Neal you absolute party animal. See, my biggest problem with Edinburgh (apart from Scottish football, but that's based in Glasgow isn't it?), is that all the takeaways shut before the clubs. What the hell?! Sort it out Edinburgh.\n\nReturning to my night out, I was pretty peckish on my way home. Obviously everywhere was shut - it was 6.30am. Except everywhere wasn't shut. News plus, just seconds from my flat (hence I'd given up by now) was open! Result! I got a coronation chicken sandwich, which was actually very very tasty.\n\nSo now I feel a sort of affinity with this place. They helped me out in my time of need so now I feel loyal to them. It's a pretty good newsagents to be loyal to. It doesn't sell more that it should, and it sells all the right things at the right price. It's just a bloody good newsagent"
1,"Just slightly off the strip, Ellis Island is the place to go for late night steak and eggs. Save yourself the trouble of finding decently priced steak and eggs on the strip and just take a taxi here.\n\nFor $6.99 you get a nice size piece of not too shabby cooked steak, fried potatoes, and  eggs anyway you like. WITH toast of course :)\n\nThe wait wasn't too bad either. Quick service. Win Win. \n\nNot the best steak, but for that time of day, it will definitely satisfy and post partying cravings you have!"
1,"I had an EXCELLENT time at Moon with my friends. First off, the DJ was resident Clinton Sparks and he was throwing a party for himself while we were there. He was great! Top 40 mix with hip hop added. \n\nWe got hooked up with BOGO bottle service for 4 people and comped admission to all the other Palms clubs that night. We didn't get a chance to venture out, because we were having a way better time at Moon.\n\nThe bottles were 425 + tax and gratuity. Such a good deal since it was bogo. Our promoter Jamaal Rouzan was great! \n\nThe table was off the dance floor, and our waitress was great, she was always quick to be there to pour us drinks with a smile, and even danced the night away with us at one point. The bus boy was also great and gave me this flashy light thing :)\n\nI even got the bouncer to do a little bop and fist pump at one point! \n\nThe table was very large considering it was the 4 of us. At one point 6 of our friends joined us and there was PLENTY of room for them to sit as well! So much better than being crammed in Marquee -_-;;;\n\nAlthough this is a smaller club, I enjoyed my time here much better than I did in the ultra packed Marquee. People are just much friendlier, table service went off without a hitch. They even gave us a ton of free FIJI waters and the mixers were NOT diluted like the other clubs. I believe we also had 2 red bulls :)"
1,The food here is amazing. Just like grandma would make it in India! Paranthas are really good. This place is neat and clean. Simple food cooked home style!
1,"Very tasty - been twice now. The italian was outstanding - hands down best sub shop of all the chains. Puts Subway to shame. Better than Cousins and even Blimpies which I used to frequent (not anymore!). I would give 5 stars but the cheese steaks are lacking - they have good meat and bread, but they need to toast the bread, and the cheese turns too melted/watery. But the cold sandwiches are amazing. Excellent service too."
1,"Been coming to Montreal since the late 90's and never had a smoked meat sandwich. Well when the hubbs wanted to come up to watch our Mets take in the Blue Jays at Stade Olympique I made it a point to come here for dinner. \nI do have to say Jewish Deli is my #1 favorite type of food. The reason for this has to come from my Grandmothers next door neighbor who IMHO made the best sour dill pickles EVER!!!!  But I digress, but will get to their pickles in a bit. \nLet me start off with the place. We get there and it is tiny with maybe 8 tables I could see that were chocked full of people. Also facing the food was a bar that had stools you could sit at. When we got there (9 on a Saturday night) the only two places to sit were at the bar which were fine by us.\nNow as I have said before I love Deli food so when it comes to the meat I am a little picky.  I do prefer a more fatty cut of meat and they deliver. You have your choice of three levels of fattiness which is a nice option as not everyone enjoys the fatty part of brisket. \nThe fries are amazing as they are whole potatoes that look like they are cut in house. An order is large enough to split although I tried valiantly to not hog them all but failed miserably. \nOk now the star of the meal for me was the pickles. They were so good that I let the husband have the rest of the fries so that I could have his pickle. Putter is the brand name of them and I really wish that they had them on this side of the border."
1,"I went to the Bengali and Indian restaurant Voujon for the first time a few weeks ago and since then I have been back twice.  They serve traditional and authentic Indian dishes which are full of flavour. I have had a few of their curry dishes and my favourite is the King Prawn Bhuna which is very tasty and quite spicy but not too much that it ruins your meal. \n\nThe dishes at Voujon are all very well presented and the foo is reasonably priced, with main meals around \u00a39 and there is an extensive veggie menu available as well. They offer several different types of rice and there is plenty of variety of side dishes to accompany your meal. The decor inside is very authentic and modern whilst the staff have always been very attentive and warm.  Voujon also do takeaways and is available for private functions."
0,"You can not pay me money to eat here again. They cannot even cook edamame, it was undercooked and cold. I had to stop eating their sushi in fear I would be sick for work in the morning. Texture and temperature of the fish scared me. Save yourself pain and throw your money out the window. Only plus side was their friendliness in service."
1,Scarpetta was one of the best dining experiences I have had.  The atmosphere is quiet and romantic and we had a view of the Bellagio fountains from our table.  The pasta was amazing - my husband had the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli and I had the Branzino.  Both were excellent dishes.
0,"Usually I'm pretty easy to please.  And it's easy to make one or two mistakes. However, three of us went tonight and it was awful. \nWe had difficulty all night getting any service.  My order was done incorrectly (just wanted no onions on a burger) -twice- before it came a third time, obviously mangled and man-handled with all of the toppings scraped off (I wanted the rest of the toppings, just not the onions).  \nI gave up and just ate the fries... which were cold.\nOur drinks were always empty, we spoke with the manager, who moved us to different tables (?) and the service did not improve, so after about an hour of this, we literally got frustrated and called it a night.\n ....and I left so thirsty that I had to stop at a c-store, and buy a bottle of water for the drive home."
1,"Riley's is a large liquor store with a good selection. They have a very helpful \""mix-and-match\"" 6 bottles of beer sale, and since there's a large amount of Belgian beer, that's a good thing!  Wine is of a wide variety and includes Wisconsin wines as well. While I never purchased any sake, there was a good selection of that. Basically, for those living in downtown Madison, this is the first liquor store to seek out."
1,"So happy to have found a little piece of France in Pittsburgh! As a francophile and food-lover, i was excited to try this place out. It exceeded my expectations. The little shop mirrored the boulangeries in France. I ate the sandwich La Campagnard, which was a simple turkey sandwich on a baguette. Its simplicity, freshness, and texture made for an amazing gastronomic experience. I also sampled the Pistachio macaron which was reasonably priced and very good as well. Of course, i had to get a Baguette Tradition, which had an intoxicating smell and had the perfect consistency of crunchy and fluffy on the inside. \nWill definitely go back soon, and i suggest anyone who is visiting Pittsburgh must go here. \nThe only downside was that there were only a couple of tables, and with the line forming into the street, not everyone could sit. Luckily, there is a park across the street."
0,"I got the lumber jack breakfast.\n\n2 pancakes - better than I have ever had at any other Denny's.\n\nBut that's it, eggs were overlooked and replaced with over cooked scrambled\n\nBacon scraps that were over  and left overs from yesterday\n\nSausage overlooked and old.\n\nRed skin potatoes were not even roasted they were deep fried a little.

0,"McFadden's Restaurant and Saloon? It should be ashamed to call itself a restaurant, and even they'd tell you it isn't a saloon. You'd expect a place like McFadden's to be Irish. There's nothing Irish about a very dark place playing overly loud ghetto music. We sat ourselves on the patio to get away from the loudness. We counted 4 security guards, 3 waitresses, and 2 bartenders. 9 Employees and it took 10 minutes to get someone to ask us if we wanted a drink. Then it took another 10 minutes to get the drink and I think there were only about 6 other customers. Most of the employees stand around and play with their phones. \n\nThere are much better places to go in Westgate. We went to McFadden's our first night in Glendale and it became the punchline for the rest of our trip."
0,"After reading the reviews of this boarding facility, I felt comfortable leaving my two babies there for four days. However, after seeing the condition they were in upon pick up, I will never board my dogs here again. \n\nI boarded my two medium sized dogs together for 4 days over the holidays (December 23-27). The only request I made was that they be separated during feeding because my older dog is a grazer so my younger dog will eat his food as well. When I made the request, it seemed like there was no problem. \n\nWhen I picked up my dogs, I was notified of a raw mark on my youngest's mouth but was reassured that there was nothing to worry about and that it wouldn't need vet attention. I wish the raw mark was the biggest concern. \n\nBoth dogs were COVERED in feces and dirt. It was so thick that it took two baths to really get them cleaned. While bathing, I noticed scratches, cuts & raw marks all over my older dog which were not brought to my attention when I picked them up. Besides these minor marks, he had a HUGE gash in his bottom lip that was bleeding & scabbed up cuts under his neck. He was so thin that he didn't look like he had eaten in days.  \n\nBeside the raw mark on her mouth, my youngest also had a scabbed cut above her eyebrow, raw marks on her paws & a bumpy rash on the side of her face. \n\nBoth dogs' nails were so short that they continue to bleed 3 days after pick up. \n\nWhen I called to address my concerns, the owner stated that \""they were really active\"" & that \""those type of dogs are typically more active than others\"" (both dogs are pit mixes). When I asked about the feces & dirt, he said they should have been cleaned before being returned and offered a refund for the amount of two baths. When I asked about the weight of my dog, he mentioned that requests to feed dogs separately are a \""big pet peeve\"" of his but that someone did indeed watch my dogs eat. The gash in the lip & scabbed cuts are still a mystery. \n\nI understand that dogs become depressed or have separation anxiety which will cause them to lose weight. However, my dog was skin & bones and was so weak he couldn't even walk up the stairs which was never an issue before. \n\nI was hoping to get an explanation of the care of my dogs while they were there, but instead it was immediate defense and no sympathy. I will never board my dogs here again."

1,I wanted to give 3.5 stars but i will spare 4. Looks better at night than in the day. But the day we went was a cold simi-windy day so maybe it affected the performance. Maybe I was grumpy or it wasnt playing my favorite song...but i just wasnt amazed like i wanted to be.\n\nIm just not sure what to write. its a nice show...the water shoots high. its free and its romantic or cool (whatever you want it to be) \n\nI thought colorful lights would accompany the music and water. I dunno...its one of those shows you have to see because you are in Vegas and its not the same if you go home without a peek..but if you miss it on your bucket list you didnt miss much.\n\nWas there 12/26/2010
0,Stay at the New York New York for my 4 days of fun & had breakfast here twice while on vacation.  I had to say that the service was horrible!  I always order bacon with my breakfast and ask for extra crispy; my bacon came out raw both days.  I ask if I could have it cook a little bit more and boy did I get attitude & dirty looks.  The food was good enough but the service is enough to keep me from coming back when I return in October.  I don't have to eat here and I will not recommend this place to anyone who comes to Vegas. \n\nIt's a shame because the french toast is amazing & so is the cafe mocha!
1,So I'm probably not the first one to say I went here just to see what GR is all about! He talks so much about how great he is so I had to prove him right or wrong. He was right! I loved it! I didn't think burgers and dogs could be so different. Plus it also helped that the service was phenomenal! Ask for Alex with the glasses but be warned...you won't be allowed to order what you want! Lol! He wouldn't let me get plain fries and insisted on getting the truffle fries and he was so right! He made my visit very memorable. He entertained us and I got to meet basically all the staff! He told us how great GR was and that he's nothing like the prick they try to make him seem. Personally I think the guy is so level headed and straight forward just like his menu here. The bun was toasted just right for my dog and the sausage had a kick to it that was pretty f-ing incredible. It was just good food. I will go back every time I'm in Vegas! Thanks Alex!!!
1,"I'm impressed so far and I consider the experience not to be complete as of yet.  I scheduled an eye exam this morning and was helped by Dr David Anderson.  I wear contacts and glasses and have issues with allergies.  He observed that my eyelids were puffy and had me try Elestat which I've never tried before.  OMG, this is some good stuff.  It made a huge difference on how my eyes felt.  We discussed my approaching need for bifocals in the future and agreed to hold off for now.  Ohh, the joys of age 40.  Then due to my eye allergies I'm currently doing a 2 week trial pair of contact lens versus the one month disposables i've been currently using.  I have a follow up for saturday appointment for an eye dilation to see if I need to go on some steriods, but I'm truly impressed with how thorough Dr Anderson has been so far.  The office staff is friendly as well.  Now, I can't speak for the service of obtaining eyeglasses, but so far I'm pretty sure i will be a repeat customer.  Thanks."
0,"I went to Isis after seeing the yelp reviews, but unfortunately I did not have the same experience that everyone else had. My boyfriend and I both had our haircut by James. My boyfriend's hair came out fine, but I had the worst experience of my life. I had really long and thick hair, and simply asked for a TRIM. Before I knew it, half my beautiful hair was on the floor. I now have a mullet! James kept thinning and thinning until nothing was left. If you are a woman, do NOT go to James. Or, if you do, make sure he understands that you don't want to look like a boy."
0,"I remember loving the Isobar back in 2005/2006, but these days it's seems to lack any real character.\n\nThe staff are welcoming enough, and the drink selection is pretty good (and well priced), but the place feels a little sterile."
0,Had lunch with two of my friends on 3/13/14 at this location at 3:30pm  Two of us including myself got incredibly sick. We are in town for business. After our meal little did we know that the next 36hrs we would both experience the worst episode of sickness in our lives.  We are middle aged men.  It was the food and we are NOT happy about this.  I am simply notifying the restaurant and consumers for their safety.
1,"I am a HUGE thai foodie. With that being said, I found Table Thai through Yelp, quickly placed an order for delivery and was very satisfied with what I got! Upon arrival the food was still warm as if it had come straight from the kitchen onto my dinner table. The driver was very nice and even gave me some free thai iced tea for ordering delivery. \n\nFood:\n\n- The first thing i got was a yellow curry. For the price it was a bit small portioned but really satisfied my hunger. The sauce was excellent and had a bit of a kick to it (i got a medium) and had a VERY generous amount of meat in it. The flavor was excellent as well as the consistency; not too runny, not to thick. This came with your choice of white or brown rice. \n\n-Second, I ordered the pad thai. Once again this was on a scale from not spicy-spicy. I got a medium but the flavor was not spicy at all. Anyways, the noodle were very flavorful and all around good. They came with chicken, bean sprouts, green onion, egg, a lemon, and peanut topping.  \n\n-Thai Iced Coffee. Enough said. It was absolutely amazing. \n\n-Thai Iced Tea: Simply amazing. Wow.\n\nOverall, this was the best delivery thai I've had. 5/5 would order from here again."
1,"I had the Cuban sandwich and soup for lunch.  The soup was curry parsnip with shrimp ceviche, which was fantastic.  The sandwich was also good, but the highlight for me was the soup.  I also got the specialty lemonade and it was also very good.\n\nThe service was fine, but the food took a while to arrive.  Considering it was busy it wasn't a big deal.\n\nMy only complaint and it's a minor one is that there was not free refills on the specialty lemonade. It was good."
1,"Diablo's is definitely a place you want to go to during your next trip to Vegas. After sitting there for a minute, I realized that I had already fallen in love with this place without even tasting the food. The atmosphere was cool and upbeat and the place was packed! Thank God for reservations. I wasn't that hungry when I got there and noticed the HUGE portions. Mounds of nachos, the hugest pyramid of guacamole, cocktails by the pitcher. I opted for an appetizer - chicken and pork taquitos. I also added a side of rice and beans. Deeeelicious! My friend and I ordered a pitcher of Sinful Vixen and yes, as others have noted it is AMAZING! Sweet but you can definitely taste the alcohol. Our other two friends weren't going to drink as they were saving up for one of those guitars full of liquor at the Rock House. Buuut once they had a sip of Sinful Vixen we had to order another pitcher for them! :) The only reason why this place is not getting a 5 star rating is because the service was a bit slow partly because of the flock of diners. I will definitely come back to Diablo's again and again though. I'll post some pictures later."
1,"This is a great place for all occasions. Great prices, great food, and great ambiance. Try the Kung Pao spaghetti, it's BOMB!!!!!"
1,"I spent 4 years eating at the Bison Witches in Tucson.  Though this place clearly isn't in Tucson, the menu holds dear food memories to me and it would probably be hard for me to not rave about it.  I love their 1/2 sandwich 1/2 soup option.  I love the potato bacon soup.  Their bread the sandwiches come on is always delicious.  It's big and thick and always fresh.  The service was a bit slow at first, but once the waitress came over it was good from there.  I definitely suggest giving Bison Witches a try if you haven't before.  If you've been, even to another location, you know this place is great!"
1,"Martini Ranch has become Wasted Grain after some remodeling. I came on a Saturday night and the line was not long and ladies got in for free. The front men were nice and friendly. Once in, the 1st level has the stage which housed a bar and live rock band for the night which covered 80's to contemporary rock and pop music. If you continue straight through to the corridor there is a patio which has darts, corn hole, the bathrooms and stairs to the right to get to the 2nd level. Take the stairs up, then walk across the rooftop patio which has some seating and you will finally reach the club. \n\nThe 2nd level houses a small indoor dance club very similar to Smashboxx. The DJ played a mix of hip hop and EDM and the bar is pretty large so you don't have to fight much to get a hold of a bartender. The VIP booths surround the dance floor and the light effects are mediocre. \n\nThere's another set of stairs right in front of the dance club so you don't have to go all the way around to the initial ones you took to get there. These lead straight to the bathroom from the 2nd floor down to the 1st. \n\nThe age group and ethnic mix was extraordinarily diverse. Probably the most mixed group at a bar or club I've ever seen, even more so than Las Vegas. Ages ranged  equally from the 20's to the 60's and a fairly equal number of men and women as well. \n\nOverall, the layout is interesting and there's some free seating as well as games to play. Ideally, this isn't where I'd like to spend my Saturday night, I'd rather be at The Mint or INTL. I would take relatives visiting Arizona, or friends that just want to \""chill\"" and not party, here, or even a date - that would be fun. But if I really want to have a good time, I want to hit a proper dance club with my friends. But that's just me. This place isn't for everyone but it does have a lot to offer."
0,"Went to this joint about 2-3 years ago and I was not impressed. I did all my research and went for the secret menu and ordered the burger and fries \""Animal style\"". They just dumped thousand island dressing on it with bacon and cheese. It was nothing special and it was just full of grease. I heard the ones in San Fran were a lot better. I hope so...because I really didn't understand the hype of this place.."
0,"Green Leaf's and Bananas is located in the food court of Las Vegas Premium Outlets North. Green Leaf's has made to order salads whereas Bananas serves smoothies and frozen yogurt. There are two lines respectively, and they both seemed to move slowly. We ended up ordering a Mango Magic smoothie and it took a while for us to get it as well. The smoothie itself wasn't as delicious as I'd hoped it be."
1,We came in for some end-of-night drinkies and maybe something sweet.  I loved this place except for the champagne switch-a-roo.  My friend and I wanted a glass of champers and there was only 1 on the menu.  The guy comes back and says they're fresh out but he would open a bottle of something else but its $2 more.  Hmmmm.  I think he should have charged us the same rate but oh well.  The other friend got a beer that he liked.  We tried 2 desserts.  They were both good but one was a front runner.  The brownies.  Wow.  Little scrumptious bites in this yummy sauce.  Yummers!  We also tried the churros and chocolate.  They were ok.  Little churros baby churros in a pudding.  I wanted the chocolate to be richer like they do in Spain.  \nOur hotel was right across the street.  I'm surprised we only went here once!  Its a great place if you want just a glass or a flight to try.
0,"Okay so I show up at 7:30 am and ask to check in early.  I know that there is an early check in fee because when I called the night before they told me $20.  When I check in the front desk clerk says its $30 because I'm checking in before 10am.  CRAZY!! but at this point I am already here, so yes charge me the extra $30.  Then she tells me I am booked for a standard room and I say yes.  She ask would you like to upgrade to our renovated part of the hotel, I ask is it a standard room?  Yes, she replies...then what is the upgrade if it is a standard room?  Is the upgrade the renovation?  The hotel at this point is on my get the hell out like in a horror film.  I ask for a non smoking room the room she gives me smells worse then the hallway.  The rooms are old and dingy, while housekeeping does a good job at keeping the room clean because it is so old is looks dirty.  This hotel should not be given such a high rating on any hotel search site.  It lacks luster and over charging for basically the same room at the hotel 6.  Other people Yelp are much to kind to rate the hotel at a 3-star....It really is worse."
1,"Definitely tasty, but not worth 5 stars in my opinion. They have a LOT of sushi roll items (about 100+) but in my opinion, that's WAY too many. It always takes me forever to go through the menu and after awhile, all the rolls sound the same. \n\nService is good and the sushi chefs are nice, but the menu is a bit overwhelming."

0,"You know, Ive come to Urban Beans many times in the past and it was great. Send my hubby to grab food today and wow! What a disappointment. I had an egg sandwich which the egg was overly peppered and grey. Gross, which is too bad because the english muffin was really good. The fruit salad was also gross, the strawberries were brownish and transparent and the cantaloupe was mushy and mealy too. Also had a yogurt parfait with granola and there was 2 tablespoons max of yogurt and the rest of the cup was granola! Its supposed to be the other way around. Disappointing because I wanted to support a local business, but I cant wait for the Starbucks to open now!"
0,"8/06\nFirst visit.  Happy hour.  Two rolls- A Philadelphia and a spicy salmon roll, deep-fried, with roe on top.  Most sushi spots gladly substitute an ingredient if the regular order contains allergens I can't have without an upcharge.  Not Kabuki.  (I've had owners, chefs, and cooks tell me themselves that if a recipe is easily amenable, they'll gladly do the substitutions, w/ no offense taken.  This Kabuki chef isn't one of them.)  So food photos will reflect these recipe omissions.  Ordered a glass of house pinot grigio, which had a big black speck floating in it, but this was quickly remedied.  \n\nSo few HH apps and drinks to choose from.  Servers were friendly enough, but sushi chef was VISIBLY annoyed (full face-frontal) when I had to return a dish as it contained an allergen I requested not to be used.  I could understand the offense if I had forgotten to include the info, or if I had multiple orders that made it hard for him to keep track, but a mistake on the second of two dishes, and with a list of allergens on a note right under your nose as a reminder??  \n\nAtmosphere is nothing to right home about.  I did like the lone red mosaic tile in the women's restroom.  Loved the contrast against the all-black theme."

Dont know why since there were at least 3 employees at the register. i would understand if there was only 1 person working but that wasnt the case. they lock the door and watch you from the inside. there was a family of 3 in there taking their sweet time and didnt seem to look like they were getting anything. after 15 mins of waiting, i left. i didnt get a chance to go in to get what i needed. i gave this place 1 star because the store is fully stocked"
1,"I decided to try for a quick lunch today, so I finally returned to Archi's after my first visit over a year ago. Funny thing is that it wasn't quick. It was ridiculously crowded for lunch and we actually had a 15 minute wait.\n\nLunch specials are all $7.95 ($8.95 with shrimp, +$1 for brown rice). They have ten selections: pad thai, sweet and sour (a stir fry), fried rice, red curry, spicy basil (with ground meat), broccoli ____, pepper steak, pad pak, kung pao, and ginger ginger ginger. Yeah, that's the same word three times. Unfortunately, they didn't have pad see ew, which I kinda wanted to try, so I picked something else.\n\nFirst item brought out was the soup of the day. Apparently, today's soup is something of a hybrid between chicken noodle soup (without the noodles) and egg drop soup. I enjoyed it a lot and quickly, and then there was about a ten minute wait for the rest of the items as the kitchen worked to get my food together.\n\nMy entree of choice today was the red curry, 2 of 10 on the spice level. I'm pretty sure a 3 would've tasted much the same, which is disappointing because I was trying to keep it even milder than I remember having my pad thai last time. I thought the red curry portion was reasonable, and the addition of zucchini to the standard bamboo shoots and bell peppers made it interesting, but it just wasn't as tasty as other places that I've tried. The lunch special also included a salad with some kind of sweet dressing, a fried wonton, and a veggie egg roll. Good, not great or anything.\n\nWater was still refilled early and often and the dining room was still aesthetically pleasing. However, the failure of the red curry to meet my standards means that I'm taking Archi's down from 5 to 4. Heck, it wasn't even that red. What were they thinking?"
0,This past weekend I went to the mint for their 24K brunch which is supposed to be amazing.  Unfortunately I didn't even get the chance to try it.  I walked in with 2 friends and was not even acknowledged by the hostess.  We had to ask for a menu and were rudely handed them.  We asked for a table and she said to seat ourselves so we did.  We were promptly given waters by who I believe was a buser.  We asked to order drinks and he said our server would be right with us.  After 30 minutes we gave up and left. Our server never came.  We asked multiple people where they were and the answer was always that they would be right there. I was appalled that this happened.  I was looking forward to testing this brunch out.  Service is important and The Mint has terrible service.

0,Dirty and unprofessional staff.  My husband and I were going to stop in here for a quick bite but decided to leave because the restaurant was so filthy and the staff was incompetent.  Instead of having the host stand at the front not doing anything have her start to clear the dirty dishes that were on peoples tables or wipe the menus with a cloth... GROSS.
1,"Crane Alley rocks! Drinks are are strong and the food is great. We had the Italian beef and Reuben and both were solid. The wait for a Friday night wasn't too bad- about a twenty minute wait for a table, but we grabbed a drink and a couple seats at the bar while we waited. Atmosphere was lively and staff was great!"
1,"I live in Seattle and have a son that is stationed in Las Vegas. I wanted to do something nice for my son and his girlfriend for his 21st birthday.I saw the travelzoo special too late after it was sold out, but emailed the wonderful people at Bagatelle inquiring about gift cards. Todd, from Bagatelle customer relations emailed me right back and with his help I was able to set up an incredible party brunch experience for them. Outstanding customer service here! My son and his girlfriend loved this place so much that they plan to go back and bring friends. They said the food was delicious and entertainment and atmoshphere were incredible. Thank you, Bagatelle Las Vegas, and Todd, for helping me make his 21st birthday one to remember."
0,"Unfortunately, I must concur with previous reviewers: SeaLife is just lame. There were absolutely no specimens there that I have not seen many times elsewhere, and quite a few of which my husband and I have at home in our own reef tanks. In three tanks today we saw dead and dying fish. No wonder they had precious little live coral, if they can't even keep fish alive. The plastic coral substitutes were just awful looking, and my husband couldn't help but correct one of their \""experts\"" who told another patron that a rock he pointed to was covered in algae, when in fact it had some live mushroom coral on it. The passageways were just too crowded and filled with screaming children, and their cacophony echoed off of the tanks and cave-like interior. Save your money and take the family on a trip to San Diego."

1,"This Mediterranean restaurant was amazing.  Our waiter was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the food.  We ordered the fattoush salad, which was pretty good.  We thought it was a bit sour, but still enjoyable. With that came pita bread with this amazing dip - olive oil with spices and sesame seeds.  I have no clue what was in that but it was simply divine!  My future mother-in-law wanted Majadra but the menu didn't have it.  When asked, the waiter said that they didn't have this dish because not a lot of people enjoyed the garlic sauce that came with it (who doesn't like garlic?!?!?!!) but he did recommend a dish that was very similar to the Majadra, which she very much enjoyed. She also ordered the Split Pea soup, which she said was delicious. My future father-in-law ordered the Egyptian Canneloni, which was very tasty, a bit too much cheese for me (but I have high cholesterol so I can't enjoy those types of dishes too much), but the taste I had, put atop a piece of pita bread was delicious. The accompanying Lentil soup he ordered was quite enjoyable as well. My fiance ordered the Musakka with Bechamel, which again, amazing.  I ordered the Spinach Pie, my first time, and was impressed with the melody of flavors.  We didn't get dessert because we were satisfying full after the appetizers. THe water is flavored with orange-blossom flowers. A very pleasant surprise.\n\nThe atmosphere was casual and intimate, which was great.  I would come back to eat here."
1,"I'd like to preface this review by saying I haven't had very many fine dining experiences. That being said, this is by far one of the best in terms of food quality and service. Yes, it is indeed pricey, but that should be expected with any fine dining experience no matter where you are.\n\nI can only comment on the dishes I tried, so here they are:\n+ Complimentary bread & spread - All of the bread was great. For our spread, we had olive oil, egg plant, and marscapone cheese. I've always preferred butter instead of olive oil, but this one was quite tasty. The olive oil had an almost herbal/spice taste to it. The egg plant is prepared with a tomato sauce or something, so it paired really well with the stromboli bread.\n+ Roasted Sea Scallop appetizer - Delicious, practically melts in your mouth. The portion is rather small as you only get two.\n+ Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli - Very rich to the point where it was almost a struggle to finish the plate, but it was so scrumptious, I couldn't stop eating.\n+ Spaghetti - Probably one of the best I've ever had. Pasta perfectly al dente with just tomato and basil, but the sauce had a creaminess to it that made it divine.\n+ Black Cod - Another great dish, but overshadowed by all of the other fantastic plates. It was seasoned well. The accompanying cherry tomatoes tasted so bright. If I ever go to Scarpetta again, though, I'd probably forego this dish and try something else.\n\nLastly, to expand on the service aspect, our waiter was very personable, cracking a few jokes throughout the night. He was helpful with making suggestions on the menu and explaining everything. Our water glasses never really went low. Oh, and the view of the Bellagio fountain was gorgeous. Only downside is the window divider thing was right at eye level, so we had to look above or below it to see. Definitely a wonderful restaurant for a date night, though."
1,"If you've eaten at one CPK, you've eaten at them all. Honestly I feel that writing a review for a particular location of a popular franchise is repeating the facts stated in the other reviews (with slight variations of opinion and specific experiences). Well, now that I've already defined how this review is supposed to go.... \n\nThe food is always good whenever I hit this place up. I've never had an issue with their service or the wait times. Their location is deep inside of the mall, so strip wanderers may never make it in this far. The establishment is nice and clean - though smaller than most CPKs that I've been to. Yadda yadda...\n\nThere's just one thing that stands out the most for me - the frosted mugs. YESSIR, THEM FROSTED MUGS AT THE BAR! Every single time I've ordered a beer, the mug is nice and frosted - the top of the head slightly frozen over. I can't find a spot in the mall that serves a beer better than this place. Of course El Segundo, Stripburger, and RA have full service bars with larger drink selection - but bam, this CPK wins my heart over with their frosted mugs."
0,"Before everyone attacks me for giving this place a one star, I'll have to mention that I ordered a salad (b/c i was full from drinking my yard dog from fat tuesdays). \n\nFood: I ordered the caesar salad but it came with these weird croutons that had gunk all over them. I'm sure it was edible but it just looked incredibly gross. Other than that the salad was a salad and satisfied my cravings for vegetables after an entire weekend of being starved from them. \n\nAppetizers: BAD. We ordered nachos, fried pickles and buffalo wings. The spicy buffalo wings were by far the worse. They were not so much spicy but just incredibly tangy. Trying to finish my one wing was like torture because everytime I tasted the sauce, my face would have no control but to make a face from having eaten something very tangy/sour. Fried Pickles were probably how they were supposed to be but just not my cup of tea. To describe them for you readers though, it was warm and kind of mushy. I prefer my pickles crunchy and cold, and I think that's how most people do too. \n\nOn the bright side, the fat fries which were basically potato wedges that my boyfriend ordered were crispy and actually really good. \n\nBut he told me the burgers were just meh so I don't think I\""ll ever be back to give their burgers a chance."
0,"Ordered the new Double Layered Premium Pepperoni Pizza.  Picked it up and they were out of the premium pepperoni.  The manager didnt even tell me. They didnt say a word till I went back in, because all I had was a pepperoni pizza.  No sorry or warning or anything.  Pizza was really bad as well.  This place has been going down hill for at least a year.  I finally learned my lesson."
1,"HIked the Cholla Trail one evening with my partner on the recommendation of our hotel concierge. She, a Phoenix native, climbs it regularly in a reasonably short amount of time. I am not a Phoenix native and quit running regularly nearly two years ago shortly after I hiked Squaw Peak for the first time (shameless plug: check out my review). We did not climb Camelback as quickly as she did.\n\nThe Cholla Trail is a steady climb until the last hundred yards or so when you have to scramble up the side of the mountain to get to the top. Since we did a weekday, evening hike, we didn't run into much traffic so when we got to the top after an hour and 15 minutes, there were maybe a dozen or so people hanging out, only a couple more than we passed on the way up. It was nice because we had the trail practically to ourselves for most the time.\n\nThe Cholla in the late afternoon is an ideal hike because you spend most of your time in the shade of the east side of the mountain. The haze/smog/whatever you want to call it made for a disappointing sunset from the top. But it can still kick your ass."
1,"Any restaurant that can convince our 8-year old daughter that goat is her new favorite meat is serving really superb dishes. These folks are masterful in building complex and distinct flavors, some spicy and others mild, but all melt-in-your-mouth delicious. We drove 1200 miles from Portland, Oregon to visit family, knowing all the while we couldn't leave Phoenix before coming to eat here. We're so glad we did, and can't wait to come again."
0,We were not impressed. When we came in the lady seamed nice tell she asked if we has reservations .we said no is that a problem ?she didn't answer us .she was very put off because we didn't have any .over half the tables were empty.I had pesto and pasta very bla. My husband had cannoli the meat in it tasted bad.there house dressing is pretty much oil with a splash of vinegar.
1,"The kids and I love this park. They really decorate great for Christmas, have a lot of things for the kids to do. The only thing I don't like is that they recently went up to 2 tickets per ride for the meri go round and the train ride. When you have a bunch of people it can get pretty expensive when you ride each ride a few times. The prices on ice cream are great though compared to most ice cream joints!"
1,"Basically this place is the same as Filibertos, we got the chimichanga and it was delicious. I don't taste much of a difference from many other Mexican restaurants I've been too but it was good!"
1,"If you want to impress a date, take them to Marcellino's.  My first visit there was with a date, and I was definitely impressed.   Your dining experience there will be private, personal and in a lovely atmosphere.  As a diner, you will feel like everything is especially for you.... and it is. Marcellino makes sure that your meal is worth savoring and that you will appreciate your evening enough to return."
0,"It's been awhile since my horrible experience with this company but I saw some posts about them on a Laveen, AZ, Facebook page and thought I'd go for it.\n\nTHIS COMPANY SUCKS.......THE OWNER AND TECH NAMED ALEX!!!!!\n\n Alex came to our house four times last summer between July 2013 and September 2013. Replaced a capacitor and put freon in. A/C stopped working less than two weeks later and had to replace the motor (unit bolted down inside the outdoor cover). Had to come back two additional times to put freon in. Once he left his very large screwdriver inside the unit. When he came back he told my husband he knew he had left it there but said because we had just given him a large check he bought a new one.\n\nAfter pleading with the owner to send someone else this past spring when we realized it wasn't blowing cold air again......what did he do....he sent Alex. He tried to give my husband some lame excusses about leaks and wanted to do all this work while we were at work.....uuuhhh NO!! We had him pack up his tools and leave.\n\nCalled the owner on 'Good Friday', said he was out of town and would call back.....guess what.....he never did. My husband sent a very long email to the owner and we have yet to hear back.\n\nI heard thru the Laveen grapvine today that they went out of business......YAY!!!!!\n\nIf they aren't they should be and no one, I mean no one should EVER trust them......EVER!!!!!\n\nP.S. Sorry I didn't know all the technical terms....I'm a girl, what can I say."
1,"This is the exact place I love to hate. But I can't. I cannot hate you, Lodge. I just can't!\n\nIn fact, if this place didn't have taxidermied animals (yes, I just made a word up) and antler headpiece things as chandeliers, I would probably be giving this place 5 stars....... I KNOW! I can't believe it either!!\n\nMy first experience with The Lodge was as Yelp Bachelorette. I was hammered (give me a break; it was the most important day of my life so far) so I didn't think it was fair to review after not really \""being there,\"" if you know what I mean.\n\nMy second experience was last night with THE Bachelor himself, Dallas G. Yet again, the staff was incredibly friendly, quick with the service, and willing to accommodate my vegan, gluten free existence without fault. They have an amazing black bean veggie burger and orgasm inducing sweet potato fries.  DG could learn a thing or two from those fries.\n\nJust Kidding. \n\nNow, here is the BEST part of all: THREE DOLLAR SKY VODKA DRINKS FOR THE LADIES.\n\nYou don't need to know the rest."
0,"It was a rainy day when we stopped! And this place was somewhat full. I think I saw a picture of Michelle  Obama on the wall. \""whoa!\"" The First Lady was here; This place must be really awesome!\n\nWe ordered a burrito, a sandwich and a latte. The burrito and sandwich were done in like 10 minutes, but our latte 20 minutes later and I had to reminded them. we patiently waited for them to finish their orders before we can get our latte. And not a word of apologize from the staff that they totally forgot about it.  \n\nOverall, the food was alright, but the service could be better."
0,"Not only are the strings attached enough to hang yourself with, but the customer service was the worst I've experienced. They literally hung up on me when I said I wasn't interested at that price. \n\nFree hopper? Nope- it's cost you a monthly fee for every room. \n\nFree iPad? Kind of... To receive the iPad you are not eligible for the low rates on the channels- however, you are not eligible for the regular rates they post either.... \n\nTop 200 channels 12 mo deal: 39.99/mo\nTop 200 channels: Regular price 64.99/mo (doesn't exist!!!)\nTop 200 channels w/iPad 83.99/mo! \n\nGuess how much they want for HBO/Shotime?... $29/mo!!!!\n\nCox sucks too. I miss TWC and Fios from back east!"
0,"WOW! Don't go here, long wait and my whole family felt ill after. The management is horrible and have no idea what customer service is! The food was less than what it should have been probably because half of it sat around while the other half was cooking! POOR MANAGEMENT and POOR food service all and all this is exactly why I dislike chain shacks that call themselves casual dining, this is slop and there is no dining about it!"
1,"I came here for an AZ Girls Pint Out happy hour.\n\nSeems like your typical Irish bar.\n\nI was with a large group and I have to say that our waitress was extremely attentive and prompt. 5 minutes after a drink was empty, she was there to see if we'd like another. She even split all of our checks w/out us asking.\n\n My friend and I split the Jameson chicken skewers and spinach dip. Both were good. They have a good selection of beers and ciders.\n\nThe bathrooms are creepy. Not so much that theyre not lit, just the decorations on the walls. And if you have AT&T, you will have no cell service here. Parking is kind of a pain, but thats par for the course w/ any place in this area.\n\nThis is a great place to stop at on a bar crawl."
1,"Yum! \n\nWhen I think of food in Vegas, the only thing that comes to mind is something that's cheap and bad for you. This last time in Vegas, I decided to use Yelp to guide me to a place of deliciousness.\n\nMy friends and I stayed on Fremont this time. That deserves it's own review, but I'm here to heap some more praise on Le Thai. My experience here was great. It's so busy that they have reservations... I called and was told it would be a 1 hour wait. After giving the lady my number, I immediately received a text and was told I could download an app to see my progress. \n\nAbout an hour later, I notice that the app still shows there's a 30 minute wait. We ended up walking to the restaurant and were told they were very busy, and the app was correct. The hostess was very apologetic, but offered our party of four to sit against a bar area. We were hungry, so we agreed.\n\nThe service was quick! And our server was very nice and attentive. \n\nWe started off with an order of some delicious wings and chicken skewers. The wings were delicious and came with a great dipping sauce. The chicken skewers were delicious as well... Moist, tender, and had a great flavor.\n\nFor our main dishes we got the Pad See Ew, Yellow Curry, and Drunken Noodles! The three dishes were so yummy! The level of spiciness that we ordered was spot on. The dishes were delicious and the food came out piping hot. \n\nMy only complaints are this...\n\n1.) GIVE PEOPLE WHITE RICE with their meals. It's fuckin' cheap. You want to mix white rice with your food. Yes, it came with the curry, but that's not enough. DON'T BE CHEAP. Your food is already expensive as it is, and it's JUST thai food... \n\n2.) PUT SOME FAN/AIR in the back patio. It was like 200 degress back there, and the only thing that kept me from dying was the cold water and cold beer I had. \n\nOverall a good thai food place. I would definitely return."
0,"TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.\n\nmaybe cuz we decided to go on a saturday when above and beyond were going to be there....i knew it'd be packed...but DAMNNN.\nwe had a guestlist pass thing....but omg, they had all the girls meet in an area and then we all walked up together...and seriously LOL it felt like they were showing us off to everyone around just to catch attention...kinda degrading we all thought....and then the line.....half of our group got in and then they stopped our line...to let other random lines in....and we waited like 30 more mins.....it was almost 12 and we swear if they were trying to hold us outside till after 12 to make us pay...forget it!\n\nafter all that crazy waiting, we finally got in...and OMG again the STAIRS!! wtheckkk. lol its like a work out. then the craziness began, the trance room was packed and the hip hop was even crazier! trying to find your friends was sooo hard. i can usually deal with crowds and being packed like sardines, but this night i could not take it. i even felt claustrophobic and had to  give up and head on out. \n\nsorry marqueee maybe another time, but you were not the business"
0,"After a few days in Vegas doing what you do in Vegas -- eat, drink, eat, drink, rinse, repeat -- I wanted something \""light\"": Asian food! In more of a hurry and not really caring we ducked in here for a quick lunch. I really wish we would have tracked down a Pei Wei instead...\n\nThe pan seared pork (and shrimp) dumplings were very good, but the Pad Thai shrimp fell short. We weren't quite sure what was going on with it, but as my friend noted, \""why is it so orange?\"" might have been one thing. The shrimp were definitely frozen and beyond small, over cooked, etc.\n\nStick with the dumplings, steer clear of the Pad Thai shrimp."
1,"I ordered a cake with Brandi at the last minute for my son's birthday. Not only did she deliver with such short notice, she provided great suggestions for a newbie custom cake orderer. The cake was super moist and was devoured by even non-cake eating kids! I definitely will be ordering again soon and suggest others to do so too! Check out her website- www.cccakesbybrandi.com"
0,"Mon repas favori de la journ\u00e9e : le premier. J'adore le petit d\u00e9jeuner et le brunch alors quand des amis nous ont invit\u00e9 \u00e0 aller essayer EVOO, j'\u00e9tais contente. En m\u00eame temps, je n'\u00e9tais pas certaine d'aimer \u00e7a. Moi j'aime un bon brunch qui remplit. Alors quand j'ai vu les photos de la nourriture, le super placement \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise avec des petites d\u00e9cos bien subtiles comme un point d'huile et un p\u00e9tale de fleur, j'avais l'impression que \u00e7a ne serait simplement pas mon genre de brunch.\n\nJ'ai pris l'assiette poisson fum\u00e9e. Thon? Saumon? Je ne sais pas, on ne nous l'a jamais indiqu\u00e9, mais il \u00e9tait bon! \u00c7a venait avec des \u0153ufs brouill\u00e9s \u00e0 perfection et une salada au choux et pommes que j'ai ador\u00e9e. En fait, j'aurai pris un gros bol de la salade et j'aurai \u00e9t\u00e9 contente! Donc de mon c\u00f4t\u00e9, vraiment bien comme brunch. Mais le reste de la table est rest\u00e9e sur son app\u00e9tit un peu. Par exemple, mon chum avait pris le Big Irish. La plus grosse assiette habituellement sur le menu, mais qui n'avais qu'un seul \u0153uf. Ein? Un \u0153uf avec un GROS d\u00e9jeuner? Pour 17$ l'assiette, consid\u00e9rant le prix des \u0153ufs, \u00e7a fait vraiment cheap. Et si j'ai bien compris, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 impressionn\u00e9 du tout des viandes qui composaient le reste de l'assiette.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 ambiance, \u00e7a fait bistro-lounge-fran\u00e7ais un peu moderne et chi-chi, mais le service \u00e9tait quand m\u00eame bien amiable. La seule chose que j'ai trouv\u00e9 \u00e9trange \u00e9tait qu'on nous r\u00e9p\u00e8te quel plat on avait devant nous en nous emmenant l'assiette. \u00c7a peut \u00eatre l'air d'un d\u00e9tail (et \u00e7a l'est vraiment), mais je n'ai pas besoin qu'on me r\u00e9p\u00e8te ce que j'ai command\u00e9, surtout un fois l'assiette plac\u00e9e devant moi. Ce qui m'a d\u00e9\u00e7ue le plus, est simplement le prix. \u00c0 deux, avec nos lattes, c'est revenu \u00e0 50$. Pour un brunch, c'est cher!"
0,"This place is the reason why the old downtown is dying. \n\nThe food is despicable! Stale, stale and stale are the only three words I can think of\n\nSome of the items I dare not eat much less touch as they look more than two days old! \n\nI want my money back!  It cost about $25 per person, a total rip off\n\nWe went this past Sunday afternoon\n\nThe servers have the most sour face I have ever seen at las Vegas \n\nI honestly believe that this place is a huge harm for Golden Nugget. Just close it !"
1,"This could possibly be my favorite place to eat in all of Vegas.\n\nIt's located in a strip mall on the NW corner of Charleston and Rainbow- which is right in my neighborhood, making it one of the only restaurants I frequent near my home.\n\nThe owner, Jin, is seriously the friendliest person I've met. He knows everyone's name- seriously, everyone! He always remembers me and everyone else who comes here, which makes us all keep coming back!\n\nSo now, about the food.. These chicken strips are delicious. I've tried all three varieties. The baked have so much flavor, and the grilled are great too. My favorite is the fried. These are not your typical American chicken strips- battered, sodium laden, and fried. These chicken strips are panko breaded and fried to perfection- coming out steaming hot, crispy on the outside, and perfectly moist on the inside.\n\nI like to pair my chicken strips with a side of their incredible mac and cheese. They make it extra special by melting some fresh cheese on the top of your portion- adding some texture and oozing cheese fun!\n\nTheir french fries are great too, crispy and flaky. They obviously know what they're doing, unlike in-n-out burger, whose fries are chewy and flavorless.\n\nTheir choices of dipping sauces beat the pants off any fast food restaurant, especially your average McDonalds or Chic-Fil-A. It's fun to experiment with different flavor combinations with your strips- and it'll keep you coming back.\n\nThe prices are also extremely low. You will leave here satiated for only a few bucks. The thing that impressed me was how you can add more strips to your meal for low price as well. And an extra side of mac and cheese is only a buck fifty. Score!!\n\nTry this place- it's more than a hipster teenager hang out. To me, it's the best bang for your buck in Vegas. If you're looking for some good food cheap, BFG is your place."
1,"Came here with my youngest boy, celebrating his 21st. Came here around midnight and had the $2 tacos with chicken and Modelo. Six tacos and two beers total cost of $16. Can't beat the price and not bad either. Also, helped that we were also staying at Ballys too. Would come here again."
1,Always a good airport when you have free Wifi. Nice place. Well designed. Medium Size Airport.
1,"I'm amazed to have found you considering how vague of a description I received. \n\n\""stand on the corner in downtown, and you will see a small sign that says cocktails.. I think.\""\n\nWell, I didn't find you. I gave up and proceeded with my entourage to enjoy the shenanigans found in DT LV. Then waiting for the light to turn green, I see the sign. Downtown. A neon lit picture of a cocktail. This MUST be the place!\n\nWe scope it out, and sure enough, craft cocktails have been found. I proceeded to order items not on the menu because I'm a pain in the ass like that. The bartender did a fair job of making all three drinks and we enjoyed the lounge area around the back. Next time, I will try some of your house cocktails - I promise!"
0,When the shop first opened I was ecstatic. FINALLY!  A bike shop in the neighborhood that I could ride to and take care of all of my biking needs. At first the staff seemed friendly and helpful.  My last two trips there proved otherwise. The mechanic was very rude and patronizing to me. Figuring I would give them a second chance I went back and bought a suspension pump from them. When it proved to be defective I returned it and the same mechanic so much as called me a liar.  Never again bicycle vibe. I WILL NEVER AGAIN PATRONIZE  YOUR STORE
1,"The servers are pretty knowledgeable about gluten free options on the menu... and if they are new the kitchen staff is more than happy to help.  I've had the nachos there, which have to be baked and have a differing cheese placed on them ( the cheese is mixed with beer and the friers are not dedicated).  However, they were very nice in accommodating me on these slightly crazy requests in my quest for nachos.  They werent the best or most crispy nachos, but it was nice to have with a great margarita.  \nVery interesting atmosphere and decorations."
1,"Our family has used them twice now. And I was pleasantly surprised both times. We've had Dawn as our photographer both times, we actually requested her the second time. She is amazing. Everyone there is great about keeping our little one smiling and getting some great shots. Also you get a lot for your money. And the shots are a little more creative then they would be at Sears, Penny's or something similar. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone.  \n\nYou can see some of the photos in my profile by the way."
1,"Had gyoza, ramen, a very nice azuki mochi dessert, with a pot of well-brewed genmaicha. The food was good, the place is cozy, the staff friendly. What else can a hungry traveler ask for?"
1,Service was very good.  Food was better than average (expected).  Want a cheap meal without much fuss... this is the place.
1,"This is your LAST call before leaving Las Vegas! Go with your instict to stop over at the M Casino and Resort before taking off...  Your last grand buffet before going back to regular boring life style.. Stop off for your last grand buffet at Studio B! You'll thank me later! (Or hate me)\n\nGot to admit it, pretty good buffet! What blew my mind away was not the food, but yet the dessert bar! How could there be such delicious all you can eat dessert bar??\n\n I am devastated they ended the senior deal so my folks didn't get their discount. We paid  about $35 per person. One of the best part to not give up on this was there was a line for their VIPs and Handicap and another line for everyone else. Well, keep in mind if anyone in your party is in a wheel chair or an elderly, you can get into the handicap line and get in without much waiting! \n\nMy family is really not a big fan about buffets only because are eyes are way bigger then our stomach and we feel like crap afterward! BUT... who can resist missing one of the best Buffet in Las Vegas. I kind of forced everyone for a final stop and forced to have lunch at Studio B before heading to LA.\n\nThe food was impeccable. Prime rib and King crab legs, I just stuffed my face with these two items! haha. Fresh and delicious.cusines, from Chinese cuisine to Mexican, American, French! The list keeps going!\n\nOh my Gawd! The dessert section is like heaven. And usually at buffets the desserts doesn't taste so good, their either too sweet or not sweet enough, but this place is amazing! All different kind of cupcakes, from Red velvet, chocolate to peanut butter.Creme Brule, to all kind of cakes, macaroons, the best a full gelato bar!I had a pistachio nut gelato and a cappuccino (Yes even a cappuccino bar) to end my meal!!\n\nUNLIMITED EVERYTHING!!.. including Wine, Beer, Cappuccino, Express, and Gelato!!  :-)))"
0,"Service was mediocre. Got beer in a 12 oz solo cup so it got warm fast. Margaritas were great, atmosphere was nice but even the patio was loud which didn't make sense (I mean dance floor was awesome but why the patio?)  mostly I only gave two stars because for the price of the drinks you'd think the bartenders would at least be friendly. I felt like I bothered the bartender with my questions about drinks. (\""Sorry I'm a customer and not a bartender here. I'll try harder next time?\"") i know bartenders have a lot they need to deal with but I mean three bartenders to like 15 people is not that busy... I'll have to try happy hour to see if service and pricing gets better."
0,Decent food.  Comparable to Panera Bread.  Terrible service. Extremely expensive ($40 for three sandwiches and three drinks).  Unkind staff.  Impolite.
1,Jessica was awesome!!! She made it a fun experience and it was easy to follow her directions. The food and beverages were excellent! The entire staff was professional and very attentive! Overall the entire experience was very enjoyable and I can't wait to go again!
0,"So the food is good, but a little pricey. The beer is great, but they have all these lame boot and stein purchase options. Why can't I just drink from a glass boot? Our service was awful. Appetizers came before our beers, and my friend had to ask 3 times where her lemonade was. The waitress did comp us a few items due to the slow service, but I would much rather get the items in proper order and quickly than deal with hassle. Don't think we'll go back."
1,"I didn't stay here but next I will be! I went there to see a concert, Nas and Damian Marley!! They were both amazing but that is a different story. The concert was in the pool area and one of the best venues ever! Not only is there plenty of cozy places to seat to enjoy the show but you can exactly see the stage and everything going on.  I do not like standing in the front because I am short and can never see anything. Plus I hate people stepping all over me and getting all up in my personal space. We were not even close to the first people to walking into the venue and we still found two lounge chairs in direct view of the concert. We sat there the whole time. We stood up to dance and mingle but we didn't have to move once. \n\nThe hotel it self is by far the most classy and vibrant hotel on the strip. The lighting and the unique design makes it undeniably the hippest hotel in town!"
1,"So we got the fountains of bellagio beautifully dancing outside and the chocolate fountain of Jean Philippe inside.  One of the many cool things to see at the Bellagio but let's be real, I didn't venture into the Bellagio to look at the chocolate drip down, I came to eat dessert.\n\nMy buddy and I decided to split a crepe and were we happy.  We ordered the mixed berry souffle crepe and sure the price is a little expensive, but its the Bellagio and it's Jean Philippe the best french pastry chef.  Well worth the price. The crepe was delicious and the souffle just melted with amazeballsness.\n\nHere's the crepe: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=BpNT1nRCmL8xnwcJDebgBA\n\nDon't worry, if you don't like crepes, there are a ton of other confectionary items and yes... GELATO..\n\nIf you have a sweet tooth and are on the strip, JP Patisserie is definitely the place to go..\n\n** P.s you cannot play in the chocolate fountain, I was deeply saddened.\n\n*** P.p.s chocolate dipped strawberries are awesome, but $4 for 1. :)"
1,"Jazz With Your Coffee?\n\nLocal Scene in the Willow/Encanto neighborhoods. Our brother Leander knows a lot of people from covering his corner of the Phoenix music/culture/sports and entertainment scene with his camera. A musician friend got him started at 5th Avenue. He got the family started there too. \n\nI'm a fan of neighborhood, non-chain, high personality small business. 5th Avenue is all those things. The menu is diverse, the food, to us, is good. We have breakfast or lunch there once a month. \n\nSomebody may get missed in the daily crush. Some aspects of the menu don't satisfy the palate and sophistication of others. Would I rather munch in Denny's, IHOP, Village Inn, Coco's, or Marie Callender's? Nope. They don't have a clubby atmosphere full of jazz and music art. They don't have big screen flat panels with the topic of the moment quietly providing information and entertainment. They are places where your money, after salaries and operating expenses flows to remote corporate centers, and if they are lucky, the pockets of stock holders. Dang, I just criticized my IRA. Wall Street forgive me for I have sinned.\n\nIf you like national consistency in menu, dependable look, and style, 5th Avenue is not for you. Open for breakfast and lunch on a corner building that's housed a restaurant for decades, we find the price of breakfast for two is about $20.00 including tax. \nTipping is always optional, especially if the service and menu don't deliver."
0,"Dr. Hom may have been in a bad mood today, but she was very rude. The whole visit, she was rude. I will not be going back there. She did fillings (more than one) and I called when the numbing was wearing off because it hurts really bad and they say they can't even give me anything for the pain, not even ibuprofen??? No way I will go back here. The assistant was late again. And Dr. Hom told me they can't do a filling on my front tooth after she told me I could at my last visit. Very unprofessional"
1,"little pricey, but damn are the calzones good!"
1,Some of their servers are really good and others are just alright. Food is amazing though! Especially traditional carnitas!
1,"Vegetarian South Indian Buffet...\n\nI've been a fan of Indian food since my first taste of Aloo Gobi, and being a west-sider, I am very rarely in this part of town, however this little gem is worth the trip.\n\nBeing in the East Valley for a meeting with my vegetarian co-worker, we couldn't pass on trying out this place.  After one trip to the buffet, we were not only hooked, we were already full.  \n\nI have  been to a lot of Indian buffets around town, and this one introduced me to a lot of new items, and tastes, I had never experienced before.  Being strictly vegetarian (and some vegan), you did not have all those \""regular\"" dishes you find in the other buffets (tandori chicken, lamb curries..etc.), so they were replaced by new and exciting delicacies.\n\nThe mushoom tikka masala was so go, I could have pulled my chair up to the buffet and stayed for the day.  We were also introduced to Dosai, or rice crepes, this variety filled with potato and onion.  \n\nIf you happen to find yourself in this part of town, a visit here is something you will not regret.\n\nOH...One last thing...\n\nYou know how they say that you can tell an ethnic restaurant is good if \""they\"" eat there.  Well during my visit, ALL the other guests were Indian!    \n\n'Nough said!"
1,Jim the host is amazing. Such great customer service!  So friendly. A great addition to the delicious food.
0,"The food deserves 3-4 stars. What ruins the experience is the wait. 30 minutes in line, followed by an hour and a half waiting for our food.  People behind us waited nearly 3 hours to finally eat. \nI understand that there's only 16 seats. But only staffing 1 cook and 1 server slows everything down that much more. \nIf this was any other restaurant, I would have walked out. I only stayed because I had family from out of town who wanted to try this place. \nSave your time and find another place to eat. The Sunset Station has a similar restaurant with more seats. And it's probably the same recipes since they're the same chain of casinos. We won't be returning to the Oyster Bar."
0,"Went to Rudy's Saturday night and was really disappointed.  Ordered baby backs at 7:30 and they only had 4.  Said it would be 30 MINUTES before they had more.  Really, out of ribs at 7:30 on a Saturday night.  Might have been a blessing in disguise as they were TOUGH and minimal meat...did order 2 pork ribs and they were pretty good.  Otherwise, very disappointed in the food...."
1,"NIce little southern hospitality airport. I like the rockers they have so you can se the goings on outside. The only drawback is that southerners for the most part should watch the southern food there are way too many golf carts going up and down the halls transporting people who don't necessarily need it, they should be walking to get rid of the excess girth."
0,"Good food, bad service. Our pho was tasty, but it was missing saw leaf (aka culantro) and a few of the Thai basil leaves were dark spotted. After our meals were served, the wait staff blatantly ignored us and we had to ask for the check. \n\nThis may very well be our last time in Chinatown after a long absence from eating out in general. It used to be the cool place in Vegas to eat and shop at a good price. These days our experiences have been very negative. We've visited a few restaurants in this area and the same scenario plays out: non-American Asians and the few whites around are treated well; and everyone else F.U. \n\nWhat started out as a small enclave in the Westside where anyone could come as they were has now unofficially become \""Asian only\"" in certain establishments. I guess the Asian tour buses in Chinatown Plaza take the place of other customers (local or not). This type of segregation reminds me of rural America and plays a big role in ruining the once vibrant spirit of Las Vegas. I was not raised to separate myself from others who are different than myself; and I find this new ambiance very jarring and disturbing. \n\nMy advice is to observe the clientele and interactions to determine which places will be a right fit. It is not advisable to just \""walk in.\""\n\nOn another note, their credit card receipt looks ambiguous because the lines for pre-tip amount and tip amount were almost the same. One needs to be careful and clear when filling out and signing their credit card info on the merchant's copy."
0,I am receiving invoices when I paid in full on my visit!!! SO ANNOYING......and the prescription is the worst I have ever had. They tried fixing it and still not right!\nDONT GO THERE!!!
0,"I was very disappointed with this spot. After finally deciding to stay in Old Vegas at the Golden Nugget, I didn't have much energy to leave the hotel to find food; with that said, we decided to eat within our hotel. This place was the first one we came across since its right out in front (sort of) of the Rush Tower. \n\nFirst, the price is NOT right, ridiculously overpriced for no reason. Taste isn't the best but isn't as bad as some spots I've been to. I am not a smoker so being around smoke while trying to enjoy the meal is NOT ideal. Although I may not look it, I am a BIG eater, lol, so small servings don't cut it for me.\n\nOverall, I would not come back nor would I recommend but if you're rich and don't really know sushi, this is your spot. Otherwise, sorry to be a bubble popper. :["
1,"Donut heaven ... what more can I say? Very fresh donuts, warm and friendly staff, spacious and sunny area for sitting and enjoying your bites of heaven while leisurely sipping your coffee. The earlier you come (preferably before 1 pm!), the greater your choices."
1,"Everything was perfect!\n\nThe evening, decor, staff, drinks, food, friends. \n\nI had the 3-course dinner option, not a complaint.  With 3 other people we pretty well covered the menu, and everything was cooked, presented, and tasted great!  I cannot wait for my next visit to Las Vegas or perhaps San Francisco to go again.  Well worth the experience."
1,"I recently visited for the first time and had a great experience. Everyone was very friendly. My server, Jeremy, was very nice, helpful, and really attentive. I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and it was delicious. I would recommend this restaurant to friends and family and I plan to visit again soon!"
1,"Googled restaurants for lunch in Sun Prairie on our way back from Madison. Saw that there were many on Main Street so we decided to just cruise down and see what looked interesting. So glad that we did. If you're looking for a cozy classic pub with an awesome beer list AND tasty basic food this is the place.  Place was pretty full with what looked like local regulars and even though we were out of towners, we felt right at home and welcome. Even though the menu said order drinks and food at the bar our server came to our table was super friendly and made us feel right at home. I ordered a bowl of Gumbo and hand battered cheese curds - hubby order the Big Eddy burger. Lunch with drinks came to a whopping $18 and was super. Would definitely go back next time we're driving through Sun Prairie."
0,"I fully acknowledge that I'm probably not target audience for this place.  I attended a professional conference and stayed here for four nights.  I don't golf, so I can't comment on that but...\n\nThe accommodations were alright (400's a suite)-I don't have incredibly high standards, but the furniture in our suite was rather dated and appeared as though it hadn't been updated since 1992.  Everything was clean, and I can tolerate outdated much better than dirty.  While I don't need a flat screen tv, I do appreciate one that does not have diagonal fuzzy lines through the picture, the channel selection was also slim.  The biggest issue for me was the internet connection.  I couldn't stream video because the connection was less than 1MBPS download.  The 'fitness center' was a rather remote location and a bit dismal.  \n\nWe did have a hospitality suite on the other side of the resort (700's maybe) and it was actually quite nice, very updated and modern, so perhaps that is part of the varied reviews here-that some of the buildings/rooms have been renovated and others have not.\n\nThe actual conference facility/meeting rooms were acceptable.  The outdoor space was quite nice and enjoyable.  I had no complaints on the food.  The staff were also decently accommodating.  Though, when I asked about getting transportation into Phoenix, I was met with a blank stare-like no one staying here had ever asked such a thing.\n\nO, and there is a replica of the Ponderosa homestead made by Lorne Greene (Ben Cartwright in the show) on site.  Yeah, that went off the air 10 years before I was born, but the family that runs it is quite nice.  By the end of the event, I had heard a rumor that the facility was in bankruptcy and bank owned which accounted for the lack of updates.\n\nAll in all, if I had the chance to stay here again, I would probably only do so if I got a great rate ($100 or less)"
0,"I know I'm going against the trend but I can truly say, I've had better, which is what a 2-star rating is means. Any average bistro in France will serve at least as good as this if not better for half the cost. O.k. so we are not in France so you have to pay extra, which I don't mind but it should be really, really good if I'm going to plunk down $38 for an entree and no sides.\n\nFirst about the food...\nWe shared the grilled octopus salad, which was very nice. It was the best dish of the evening. The octopus was tender and mild, accompanied with some citrus sauce, rocket, and various peppers and pickled peppers.\n\nMy husband had the flat iron steak and fries. I had read rave reviews of the fries but it turns out they are just fries. They remind me of In & Out. We have a local bistro that has much better fries. The steak was good, cooked to order, with carmelized onion puree and some chive butter. Good but not spectacular.\n\nI had the leg of lamb with escarole. Leg of lamb is a pretty big hunk of meat but this presentation was very thin medallions of lamb--about 8 small bites of meat. Yes, it was nice but nothing special. The escarole was fine, and it had about 1/4 cup of tasteless quinoa. I would have much preferred rich, creamy mashed potatoes. The highlight of the dish was the Hen of the Woods mushroom--fantastic! I would have ditched the lamb and rather had a plate of those.\n\nWe were so unimpressed that we decided to go without dessert. Ironically, it was our anniversary and the reservationist asked if it was a special occassion, which we said it was, and the matre d and waiter both gave congratulations but actually, that was the end of it. Have you ever been to any kind of restaurant that asks you if it is a special occassion and then does nothing? Not even a stupid chocolate-covered strawberry. For those prices and that hype, you would expect a little something when you are paying $175 for 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 glasses of wine. Why bother to ask? \n\nThe good thing is that we have always contemplated going to the French Laundry but this changed our mind. It would pain me too much to pay $600 and be disappointed. Again, it was certainly not a bad experience and it was a good meal, but not at the price."
1,Great place for Brunch!
0,"Whadya expect for a $15 lunch buffet?? Everything was average from soups to Chinese food, from pizza to pasta, from the fish to desserts, nothing stuck out to me. They do have a \""make your own philly cheesesteak station\"" but I wasn't feeling the philly at the time.\n \nPrime rib was ok. I asked for a thin slice which worked out better than the thicker slices."
0,"The room was beautiful but the beds could be softer. Great view and good AC. TV had less than basic cable, mostly local networks and Cartoon Network. Casino was clean but I wasn't on e offered a drink after several hours of playing. Pools were nice but jacuzzis were pretty dirty and they closed about 6:00 pm. Very odd for a Vegas pool. \n\nHere's why it only got two stars. After first day noticed a $100 charge that was explained to be a security deposit. They made no mention of this at check-in. Then on 2nd day nearly $100 more charges of mini bar purchases that I never made. $10 bottle of water and and $55 WiFi charges. WiFi charges! Something that Motel 6 gives you for free! They removed the charges but told me it would take several days for the refunds to hit my bank account. \n\nLeft town hundreds of dollars poorer not from the slots but from underhanded business practices and charges for things that the most basic budget motels don't charge for."
1,"I had just recently moved out here and was looking for a new nail tech/salon. I am so glad I found this place! The place is very nice, the staff is beyond friendly, and the service I got was amazing. Casandra is amazing at what she does, absolutely amazing! I am beyond picky about my nails, I like them VERY short and squared without the edges rounded & she did that without ANY complaints and I also showed her a picture of what I wanted and she NAILED the picture to a T. I will be coming back without a doubt, best service I've got since I've been down here!"
0,It's small and smokey. I mean you walk into a cloud of cigarette smoke. I couldn't run out of the cloud fast enough.\n\nWe moved to the other side of the casino and it wasn't as smokey. I don't think there is a non-smoking section. \n\nDrinks aren't bad at all. I paid $8 for a double rum and coke. It was nice and stiff.\n\nWe hardly ever gamble but this time we won almost $100. Would return but only because I am in the area.
1,"The best Waffle I have EVER HAD...PERIOD. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. They have everything from great strawberry breakfast waffles, to PIZZA waffles ! \n\nI got the breakfast special, a strawberry waffle, with 2 scrambled eggs and sausage(or bacon) and a coffee for $5.99. It was probably the best 5.99 I have ever spent for breakfast.\n\nWe met a couple different locals @ there who shared stories about the area( We where on vacation from boston) and gave us some great spots to check out in the area. If you are visiting Vegas, DEFINITELY check this place out !"
0,"I just don't get this place!  Sure, the staff are nice enough and there's some comfortable seating to chill out on with your mates, but you can do that at just about any pub in the whole city.  As soon as you walk in it feels like you've just entered a medieval dungeon and you just about need a headtorch the find the bar!  That's an obscene exaggeration, but the lighting is surprisingly dim and the general ambiance is lacking warmth.  \nThe drinks are quite fairly priced with most pints costing under \u00a33 and they do have quite a good selection of ales and spirits.  I came here about two weeks ago and just found the whole place a bit depressing, but if you came here on a cold winter's day it might offer a little more atmosphere."
1,I took my dad there for his 79th birthday and it was wonderful. We were seated right near the window for a view that was breathtaking.  The food was exquisite. It is very pricey but was so worth the experience
0,convenient location - often moved without notice or found ceilings falling or the restaurant flooded.  I quit going here because I don't feel they really value their customers.
1,"This place is Amazing! Went in today pissed off because my hair had just been completely messed up. I made an appointment right away and was treated amazingly. The stylist was awesome and listened to what i wanted, i got the perfect color and cut! I couldn't be happier!"
0,"So underwhelmed. Food wasn't terrible, I have had worse in the land of BBQ but it's not great"
1,"I don't eat the food here, but my munchin loves it."
1,"My favorite froyo around!  Great flavors, including great lo carb, and non dairy items. Nice assortment of toppings. Friendliest staff around!  The nutrition and lots of other great info is clearly on the flavors label which is wonderful. I love visiting this place!"
1,"$10 per month....no contract!!! Also, the TVs built into the cardio equipment makes \""treadmill time\"" a little more bearable. Not lovin' the purple and neon green scheme they got hapnin, but its worth putting up with to have to get locked into one of those deceptive, heavy handed contracts that fuggup yer credit and haunt your existence."
0,"I'd like to review Grilled Addiction's food, but the wait was so long that I never got to eat it. Food trucks are supposed to be fast. Limit the menu, speed up the service. Also, the truck ran out of ice in its first hour of operation. Fail."
0,"The only reason I gave this more than a one star was because of the bouncer who let us in--some of the guys had sneakers on.  I guess it does have eclectic decor, like the website said...and the dancers were fun to watch.\n\nWhat negates these good points were 1) the waitress was soo slow, we waited 15 minutes for our order and she still didn't get to us.  2) the crowd was a little older than what we wanted.  3) it was very small, therefore, very packed on a Saturday nite.  4) their damn stamp on my hand was a bitch to take off.\n\nToo bad the Pussycat Lounge was too crowded...."
0,"this is an absolutely horrible place to book a reservation!!! don't do it!!!  my husband and i booked a reservation on their website for august 15th, the confirmation at the time of booking showed all of the correct info. but, on the email confirmation the dates were completely different, (for the very next day actually). they charged us and refused a refund because they said we didn't \""cancel\"" before 72 hours. it took them over an hour to find a manager, and he acted as if he was annoyed with me and then said \""sorry you're unhappy, i'm gonna hang up now\""!! \ndo not make the mistake of dealing with these people, they changed the date on my reservation then blamed it on us and totally ripped us off."
1,"I've been to a lot of Skechers stores lately. My boyfriend's been on a Skechers fix. So I went in there to buy a gift card for his birthday coming up.\n\nSalesperson was friendly, informed me that the gift card can be used at any Skechers, even the outlet malls or online. I resisted the urge to look for shoes for me, but definitely some good styles came out lately. Next time...\n\nI definitely like that they are in Fashion Show Mall. Makes it very convenient!"
0,"Before going we called and the hostess let us know about happy hour. Half off beers and pizzas from 4 til 6. I also checked online for their happy hour which also states the same thing. Upon receiving the bill only the draft beers were discounted. I asked the waiter and he was shocked. He asked the hostess and the owner who was there and they said they never said or heard anything. At this time we showed the owner and waiter the website stating the discount.  To make things worse the waiter gives us $15 off, then when the owner finds out, he takes it off charging us full price. He came over to tell us we were wrong and he was right, he then went to argue at another table that had presented a coupon.  No sorry no nothing, the waiter was the only bright spot."
1,I've been here twice. You cannot order a bad meal. The menu concept is very clever. The servers can explain the menu better than anywhere I have eaten in town. Great place to take a date.
1,"Finally got to Akahana. Might as well get this out of the way - yes our waiter sucked, as many have experienced. Galen, if you are reading this, perhaps you should just sell records at Sam Goody's. Or sort the tchotchkes at Manifest...\n\nBut we did sit at the bar (no, the sushi bar); and got along rather well with the head chef and the owner. Seems as though they have their sh!t together. We discussed throughput, prepping and sourcing, yadda yadda. We ate sake nigiri (nice), ikura gunkan (nice) and a few rolls I can't remember the names of. Washed it all down with Asahi and all was good.\n\nBottom line is I think this one will stick in this somewhat cursed location. The sushi was really good, the cook staff is good, the atmosphere is good. The wait staff will turn over, just \""wait.\"""
1,"This is one of my favorite sushi places! The oysters are my fave aside from the unique rolls they have cause of the sauce they use. \""All you can eat\"" is well worth it here & their customer service is great. Food takes a while to come out sometimes but it depends on what you order. So worth the wait though! One of the best rolls they have is the \""love affair\"". You'll love it cause I do. :)"
0,I hope that bitchy pit boss has been fired by now.  Perhaps her name was Shirley?  She was just TERRIBLE.
1,"BOTTLE SERVICE!!! PARIS HILTON!! GREAT MUSIC!!! I had a blast here! My two friends turned 27 this weekend, and it being Vegas you gotta do Bottle Service when you go to a big club. It was my first time here at Body English and it was awesome! I think it helps when you know someone. I didnt wait in the Huge line to get in, Paris Hilton was there, so i think thats why it was so packed but we had an awesome table across from her and we basically had all the beautiful people around us. I did for a while go downstairs to scope out any stray talent for my buddy and sadly it was kinda all dudes. hahaha. so i was definitely pleased with our set up in the VIP! hahaha I would definitely come back for sure! Thanks Chris and Derek!"
1,I'm a fan of the Hickory Tavern BYO salad.. Nothing else really stands out at this particular location.
0,"First off, The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because we had an excellent server. We go to outback often (at least twice a month) and I am usually very happy, this time was a completely different story. I ordered my steak and broccoli along with it. When I got my food I started off with a bite of steak, delicious. Then I took a bite of broccoli, the second I closed my mouth I was hit with the most god awful taste. I am absolutely convinced it was some sort of cleaner. I instantly spit out my food and felt sick. I tried for several mins not to get sick, but I couldn't and went And threw up, violently I might add. My husband didn't eat his food either as he said it tasted sour. The manager came over and my husband and I explained what had  happened. The manager said she was new but to please call the manager tomorrow and let her know I was ok. I did call the manager the next day and she had no idea about the events the night before. I told her my story and her response was that it was impossible for it to have been anything not food safe. I am not an idiot, I know the difference between food and chemical. I understand that sometimes things happen, but the manager should have at least tried to make things right, instead of arguing with me.  I am not just someone complaining to get something for free. I even had the waiter ring up our drinks so we could leave a tip. It wasn't his fault the food was so horrible.  I did however expect that after such a horrible experience, that we would be offered something other than non payment for the things we didn't even eat. The manager did nothing to make it right. I am very disappointed by the way things will be handled and will not be going back. This is not the way to take care of your regular customers."
1,"Big Mama has moved from her take out only location in the Strip District to a bigger and better location in downtown Pittsburgh. They are now located across the street from the August Wilson Center in the old Steel City Diner on Liberty Avenue. There is now plenty of seating but, it gets crowded at lunch time. I especially like the gospel music playing as you walk in. \n\nThey now offer breakfast which consists of fish & grits, chicken & waffles, french toast, huge pancakes, omelettes and sandwiches. \n\nThey offer pulled pork sandwiches, ribs, smothered pork chops, baked, barbecued, delicious fried and jerk chicken.\n\nTheir sides consists of baked beans, collard greens, cornbread, green beans, mac & cheese, candied yams, seafood stuffing, mashed potatoes, rice , potato salad and linguine salad.\n\nDesserts are peach cobbler and sweet potato pie.\n\nI highly recommend the fried chicken. The mac & cheese is so so and the potato salad is decent.\n\nIf you go for lunch be advised it takes a while to get your food as everything is cooked when you order it. I would only eat in if  you have an hour for lunch.\n \nMs Brenda aka Big Mama is such a sweet woman! I wish her all the best!"
1,In the bar: cocktail with ginger beer and grapefruit (don't remember the name) was sooo good. \nApp: housemade mozz wrapped in prosciotto was stupid good.\nMains: filet Oscar and the delmonico. Both were cooked perfectly and were delicious.\nService was great. Perfect date night :)
1,I've been getting my hair done by Antony for almost 2 years now.  He is seriously amazing!  He has done my hair from brown with blonde highlights to black and everything in between.  He will listen to exactly what you want and share his opinion.  He gives a MEAN shampoo massage!!  MEAN as in excellent - he even gets your neck and shoulders - that is enough for me to keep coming to Antony!  He definitely knows how to use those scissors and blow dryer!  My hair always looks amazing when he's done with me!  I highly recommend paying him a visit!!
1,"We stayed for 7 nights:\n\nPros:\nGreat location: walking-distance to everything - transit, restaurants, shopping, etc.  \n\nKitchen (including stove): you can take a 5-10 minute walk to the grocery store, Provigo, & purchase food for your stay.  \n\nRooms are clean & comfortable.  Complimentary continental breakfast served - basics like coffee, juices, cereal, various pastries, and some fruit - suffice for most, but if you're looking for something a little more filling (eggs, waffles, crepes), there are lots of nearby restaurants / cafes.\n\nThe hotel offers 24-hour laundry and a pool - neither of which we used, but are definitely worth noting if you plan on staying in Montreal for a few days.  \n\nFree wifi is a plus but it limits you to 3 devices so keep that in mind if you've more than 3 devices that require wifi.\n\nWe booked tours with Grayline and they picked us up right at the hotel door.\n\nCons: It can get a little noisy in the morning when housekeeping starts making the rounds, and being downtown the emergency-vehicle sirens can be annoying.\n\n*I would definitely stay at their hotel in the future.*"
0,"To Howard. I owe you an apology for my first review for it was in poor form for me to mention another comedy club while I was doing a review for Stand-Up Comedy. \n\nTo the person who called me a \""shill\"". I am not a \""shill\"". I have nothing to do with the other establishment and was not scoping out Stand-Up to see what they were about. My husband and I had just put our cat, which was bottle fed and raised to be with us for 20 years, to sleep and we were looking to do something to breathe some laughter into our sadness. \n\nLet me start off by saying that this review is \""our experience\"" is may have not been the same for someone else attending the same show. \n\nMy husband and I went to the Stand-Up Comedy Club for the first time this past Friday. We arrived about 6:50 P.M. The show was advertised to start at 7:00 P.M. but did not start until about 7:20 P.M. \n\nWhen we first arrived we were told to wait in a bar area. We observed a couple of poles, curtains, and small stages in the front. Our first thought was that it was, or had been, a strip club. We started to leave. We thought the bar we were in was where the comedians would perform and we did not like the feeling of the bar. \n\nThe bartender, and man by the bar, who appeared to work there, told us the comedy club was next door. They informed us that the bar was just a place for people to wait and get out of he heat. Both the bartender and the man were very nice and cordial. \n\nThe comedians, for us, were so so. Howard Hughes, I believe he is the director of the club, was very nice and we liked his routine the best. We liked the way he interacted with the crowd. Unfortunately, we did not like the headliner's style and ended up leaving during his routine. \n\nThe Comedy Club was nicely done. The large lights could be toned down as they interfere with the ability to see the performers and are very bright. There is a two drink minimum purchase which is standard for most comedy clubs. \n\nIf we were to go to this comedy club again we would heed to Howard's suggestion and watch the videos of the comedians before making a decision to go or not."
0,"Overrated.  This place was so rude, the food was ok, and the prices were a little high for what you get.  Skip this place and go to ACE in Mesa.  Way tastier and ACE is a lot cheaper.  Never going here again."

1,"We'd been talking about going to Bistro Moderne for ages and finally booked in for Sunday lunch, tempted by the \u00a325 roast.\n\nThe restaurant is bright with a lively atmosphere and we were seated at a table in the back corner (the recessed booth next to the kitchen looked cosy - noted for a future visit!).\n\nWe ordered starters and shared the roast chicken as a main.  All of the food was excellent; my beef carpaccio starter with delicate and well seasoned and my wife's pea soup was fresh and smooth.  The chicken was served with massive yorkshire puddings, roast potatoes, seasonal vegetables and gravy. All of the component parts were delicious and we polished off the lot.  We opted for dessert as well with me choosing carrot cake and her having the chocolate mint tart; both were lovely and didn't last long.\n\nOverall a great lunch and we'll definitely be back to try some other parts of the menu."
1,"Super cute, old school Italian-American restaurant, replete with Christmas lights strung around the bar, very friendly wait staff and a killer beer/drink list. I didn't have pizza, but it looked good...Had the special veggie lasagna and a couple vodka drinks (they have Death's Door, among others) and the excellent garlic bread. The vibe is laid back- really homey. I could see making this a regular stop in the neighborhood. Others obviously agree because the place was packed on Saturday night."
0,I rather go to other place; waste of money.  I cannot believe they deep fried the duck and call bbq duck. I will not go there again due to the food quality. It taste like my wife's horrible cooking.
0,"Calling this establishment a zoo is equivalent to cutting a hole out of a garbage bag and putting in on, claiming it is a dress. You can pretend and protest all you want, but a garbage bag is not a suitable dress, and this place is NOT a suitable \""zoo\"".\n\nThe website does a fantastic job of tricking you into thinking you will be seeing lots of happy exotic animals...but when my friend and I arrived we found the opposite.  We seriously thought it was an elaborate prank! The entrance/gift-shop looked like a small single family home that had been converted to just that.  We could have easily just walked in without paying because when we went up to the ticket window no one was there...but we pondered too long and a lady finally showed up to rob us of our money.\n\nThe zoo was full of pigeons and chickens just running around free and wild...which wouldn't matter that much if they were not missing half their feathers and looked sad and diseased...it was gross and depressing.  There were not that many animals here at all, and the lion was lying in his \""den\"" and we were not even able to see him.\n\nDefinitely skip this place when you visit Las Vegas...unless you actually like seeing sad depressed animals in the dusty desert."
1,"The hubby & I went down to Fremont Street a couple of weeks ago, just to do the tourist thing. We decided to wander into The D (formerly the Fitz) to see what the new owners have done with the place. We went upstairs to see Don B's & there was a WALL where the entrance used to be! Turns out Don B's no longer exists & they moved the entrance & made it into a different restaurant! \nSO SAD!!!! It really was one of Vegas' best kept secrets! Guess I really don't have a reason to go into that casino anymore. :-(\nOn a side note, I really like how Fremont has been cleaned up! The outdoor bars are kinda cool. BUT, even with so many more \""slushie drink stations\"", I will STILL only go to The Bayou for that. They have been there at least since 2001 when I moved here, probably a lot longer."
1,Absolutely love the place. Food is great! Comfortable sitting and free wifi.
0,"Bad. Just plain bad, especially for the price.\n\nFood: \nAppetizers\nSpinach dip- gross. Honestly disgusting. Most spinach dip is thick with melted cheese, cream, chopped spinach, etc. This was whole pieces of spinach in what seemed to be Campbells cream of (?) soup and some melted cheese on top. Comes with bread, not a dipping appetizer, I had to use a spoon to ladel some onto my bread.\n\nCheese board: pretty good. Nice variety of cheeses and meats, though it did not come with any additional bread or crackers. They price it at $12/person, which is weird and a little confusing (does each person have to pay $12 or can you just order one \""person\"" for the whole table?). The latter is true and we ordered 2 \""people\"" for 5 of us and it was enough. \n\nCalamari: my favorite part of the meal. Fried really nicely and great flavor.\n\nEntrees\nPrime new York steak: $42. Absolutely not worth $42. I ordered MR and it came medium. Did not taste like a high quality steak. Came with spinach with no flavor and fried potatoes which were the best part of the plate.\n\nFrench dip: OK but not great. Fairly juicy but not what i would expect from a restaurant like this. The horseradish had the consistency of ranch and did not have much flavor. Fries were very good.\n\nShort rib: very juicy. No real complaints but it didn't blow me away. \n\nTwo others ordered fish plates which I did not try. However both were swimming in some sort of juice/sauce and neither person finished their plate.\n\nDessert\nChocolate cake: solid. Chocolate lovers dream\n\nDrinks:\nBloody Mary: spicy (good for me) but it was very thin looking and lacked flavor. Even my wife (who hates BM's) mentioned that it looked thin\n\nMargarita: terrible. It was just sweet and sour and silver tequila. No gran marnier or orange juice or anything that resembled fresh juice. Supposedly the sweet and sour is made in house, but its a very poor recipe if that's true. \n\nService:\nComplete garbage for the prices they charge. We waited 5 minutes (at least) from the time we sat until anyone greeted us and took drink orders. Another 5 minutes or so to actually get drinks. Then probably 15 minutes before he came back to get our food orders, by then we just ordered our food an appetizers together. \n\nThe servers dont seem to help each other out much either. Each time food and drinks were brought to the table, our server had to make 2 trips. \n\nDrink refills were relatively slow, but not terrible. Table management was awful. My margarita glass was empty after 15 minutes and then sat on the table for the rest of the meal until we stood up. One ordered wine but her wine glass was still removed from the table (prior to being served her first glass). When he brought the wine he had to go back to get another glass. \n\nOverall we were there for 2 hours. Will never go back. If you want to pay the same amount for dinner but get a quality meal and excellent service, go across the street. If you want to get the same service and food but don't want to pay the $$$, go to....any chain restaurant of your choice."
1,"Best vegan restaurant in Phoenix/Tempe. It's a jewel! They need to open more locations!\n\nThe only drawback is the name... try Googling \""Green\"" when you're trying to find this place. I even had a hard time finding it on Yelp to write a review! I'm just saying...\n\nNot the healthiest spot, despite the animal-free fare... But a good place to bring a non-vegan if they're trepidatious  about trying veggie food.\n\nTry the vegan version of the DQ Blizzard called the \""Soynami\"", the Buffalo Wings are INSANEly delicious, and don't be afraid to sample a special. They always have something creative and pallate-pleasing on the chalkboard."
1,"Les meilleurs frites de Montr\u00e9al, un restaurant vraiment sympa... \nPlus cher qu'un Fast food, mais tr\u00e8s abordable et d'une qualit\u00e9 excellente...\n\n\n Esp\u00e8re vraiment que cette franchise d\u00e9barque un jour \u00e0 Paris"
0,I went to this salon based on the amount of great reviews that it received. The receptionist was very nice and welcoming. I asked to schedule an appointment to get my hair colored with someone who was an expert with coloring hair. She made an appointment with AJ for the following week. Prior to leaving she tried to get aj to meet with me so she could look at my hair. My hair is very light and I wanted to go back to a darker root with a purple ombr\u00e9 or leave my light tips. Aj was too busy to have this consult.\n\nI show up for my appointment and AJ was running about 15 min behind. We sit down and she tells me that they do not have enough of the purple color to do my purple ombr\u00e9 and that the darker brown needed for my roots may require 2 processes but she would have to check her books to see if she has time to do that today. After discussing what could be done with my hair I thought we agreed to leave my tips the light color they were and do roots dark as to not cause anymore damage to my hair bc she said it was damaged. I made it clear I didn't want a boring solid color dye job. Long story short that's what I got. A one process dark that still has light spots throughout hair. She then tells me I can come back next week and she will had purple or lighten which defeats the whole purpose of not staying light on my ends. I would not recommend AJ if you want an unusual or in depth dye job. She is an average colorist.
1,"Damn you U Swirl...... you got me!!!!!!! \n\nI am officially addicted! like...\n\nHi my name is Deana, I am a U-Swril addict, and I need help!!!\n\nI LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, to the point that i dont even want to eat anything else except frozen yogurt! Its Vegas, 100+ degrees outside and if my body could sustain itself on this stuff alone i would eat nothing else..\n\nThey have 15 non-fat flavors, and 1 low-fat flavor (peanut butter) to choose from and all the toppings your lil heart desires! Although since i find myself here 3 to 4 times a week as of present, i am trying to hold off on the topping and just get the yogurt. I do get about 4 like pieces of chocolate chip cookie dough and mix those 4 pieces in so i do get i surprise in a few of my bits but other than that i am trying to be good! My favorite flavors are... The English Toffee, Cheesecake and Cookies n Cream--all in one cup!!! Can you say.. YUM!?!\n\nI have no self control when it comes to this place, which is a scary thing! I usually get a cup that costs between $4-5 and at $..36 or $.38/oz its not a small cup, i try not to eat it all in one sitting and usually i have a surprise waiting for me in the freezer when i wake up in the morning the next day!! BONUS!!! \n\nI highly recommend this place if you like frozen yogurt!! \n\nOk, review over, im off to U-Swirl........."
1,"Three of us arrived at lunch time mid week and were greeted and seated quickly. The cafe was busy but not full and our waitress came to the table promptly, drinks followed very quickly as well. My two companions ordered burgers (1 was a cheeseburger), I ordered blueberry pancakes with a side of sausage. Food took a little longer to arrive than we expected but not excessively long. The blueberry pancakes (short stack) were the best I've ever had, absolutely loaded with blueberries. The sausage was very good, a bit spicy (my favorite) but if you prefer mild you might want to pass on the sausage. My companions said the burgers were excellent, clearly not previously frozen paddies but hand formed ground beef...they were \""medium\"" as ordered and were juicy and not dry. The fries were just OK, we requested extra crispy but they were \""standard.\"" everything was hot and was served as soon as it was ready. Beverages were refilled several times which reflected the attentive service. Everything served was \""large,\"" no scrimping here and though full,  Having been impressed with the pancakes, I decided to try the homemade blueberry pie. Unfortunately the pie was served straight from the fridge...very cold, crust was not soggy but a bit tough, it was OK, but I wouldn't order it again. Overall, I give this restaurant high marks, we all agreed we'd return. Prices were very affordable and represented excellent value."
0,"I've been here about 4 or 5 times and there food is constantly gross.  The place is ran by nothing but kids and although they are nice I can't eat anything they make. I've tried going on different days, hours, buying different things but it's always nasty.  I once bought a double cheeseburger which was burned and I couldn't finish it. Another time I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger and it was dry. The bread felt like I was chomping on crackers it just sucked the moister out of my mouth.  Their blizzards and shakes are always watery when every other location I've ever been too has nice this shakes and blizzards.\n\nI've tried them repeatedly trying to save money on gas by not driving further but I think 5 times is enough to say I will go anywhere but here. I'm so upset this place failed me yet again and wasted my money."
0,"This place really disappointed me. I've been here several times in the past, but I shan't be returning. \n\nWe ordered some appetizers, two in fact. Soup and some mac'n'cheese and bacon bite things (don't judge.) Only the soups arrived. The server was pretty good, and she apologized up and down, and offered free dessert. Hey, if I was going to have mac'n'cheese and bacon bites, who am I to turn down free dessert? \n\nBut before we even got to the dessert, we had to have the entree, which was nothing short of a big flop. I'll admit, I was scared the quiche I ordered was going to be a sliver of a thing, but this was a honking piece of egg pie. It wasn't particularly warm, however. And the salad that was served with it was terrible. Like it was bathed in the Gulf Coast (olive) oil slick. \n\nMy dining companion's entree fared even worse. The chicken whateveritwas was flavorless and was covered in a thick film of olive oil; the result of being plated with another one of Bluphie's \""tossed greens\"" piles. And the mashed potatoes were, by all accounts, terrible. My dining companion is a mashed potato connoisseur, thus I am unable to account for their terribleness. In his words, \""this experience should be a testament to my love of mashed potatoes. They were so bad, but I ate all of them anyway.\"" He said they were really crusty, like they'd been sitting in a chafing dish for hours. I'm no chef, but if there's one thing life experience has taught me, when mashed potatoes form a top crust, stir it up, and voila! Good as new. That couldn't even be bothered to have happened. \n\nSo we decided to split the offered complementary dessert, as neither of us was feeling too adventurous, in light of what we just experienced. We settled on carrot cake, which, in its defense, was massive. But that's where the defense ends. To be sure, the cake was fine. It wasn't dry. It featured a cream cheese(?) frosting. But it was topped with chopped walnuts that came from some form of freezer or refrigerator. My money is on a freezer. Have you ever stored walnuts in a freezer? Have you ever forgotten them so they freezer burned AND absorbed whatever flavors were mingling in the ecosystem of your freezer? Yes? Then you know the rancid taste of these nuts. It was beyond gross. We didn't finish the cake. \n\nThe decor of the joint is loud, and it's cavernous, and has lots of seating. The restaurant wasn't full by any accounts, but did seem to be \""bustling\"". I simply don't understand why. It just wasn't good. As I mention above, I've eaten here in the past, and enjoyed it. It seems as though something has gone awry. Perhaps its decline in quality is directly related to the crappyness of the mini-corporation that is FoodFight (I am, in full disclosure, not a fan of their other establishments, by and large.) I blame them."
0,"The only redeeming quality of this place is that they serve Papago Orange Blossom Wheat Beer.\n\nI went here with my boyfriend, expecting something delicious. We had both heard good reviews, and are both burger fans so we were excited to see what Delux had to offer. Their menu was very limited in the burger region, with only two to choose from and no option to \""build your own burger\"" like many burger places have. In addition, their burgers and other menu items are very over priced in my opinion. This restaurant takes pride in serving fresh ingredients. This may be true, but my boyfriend and I both left feeling less than fresh. We were both nauseous, and the food resulted in me nearly throwing up a handfull of times. \n\nWe ordered two delux burgers; mine was served well done and his was served medium-well. Each burger came with a small side of fresh fruit. We also ordered the half and half fries. I was not impressed by the burger, and thought it was too sweet. I only ate half of mine. \n\nAfter battling through hours of nausea, I called to speak with the manager. She refused to acknowledge that her establishment was the cause of our nausea and sickness. She told us to \""further investigate\"" what he had consumed prior to eating there (but this was the first time we had hung out in 2 days due to complicated schedules- so it was the only meal we had shared). She kept saying to \""further investigate\"" what could have made us sick, when we were both certain that it had been the food from Delux. The way that she handled the situation was less than professional, to the point of being insulting. She kept saying that they get their ingredients fresh daily, implying that since their ingredients were fresh, they couldn't have made us sick- which is absurd because there could have been one thing in there that was handled wrong or cooked incorrectly. Then she told me that she would \""further investigate\"" with her head chef, and said she would call me back. She called me back less than 5 minutes later, which convinced me that she obviously didn't care and probably didn't check with the chef. \n\nPersonally, if I were the manager, I would have apologized for us not feeling well and I would have invited us to come in again, on the house, to try the restaurant again. Instead of handling it like this, she infuriated me beyond belief. The only reason I would ever go back would be to get the beer again, but I definitely wouldn't eat their food."
1,"Amazing!! Had the lobster tail and it was amazing!!! The oysters are the best I have ever had. I would come back just for the oysters. The service was awesome, our waiter (John) was awesome, and the food was totally awesome. In Caesars on the first floor, prob the best hotel/casino in Las Vegas. Now I want to go to the one in Chicago where I live. Great atmosphere. 5 stars for sure!!!! Would recommend this place to anyone who loves seafood."
0,"I hope Management at this place reads this! Went to pick up a to go order and could not find a single employee in the place to check me out. I could see my order on the counter so I proceeded to wait 5 mins. at the counter patiently for someone to help. After an \""additional\"" 5 mins. (10 mins now) I began to look around for someone. There was a little window to the back were they make the food so I kept saying excuse me several times in hope someone would hear me. I could hear voices in the back but could not see anyone. I finally had to whistle to get the employees in the back attention. When two woman came around the corner they looked at me pissed off like how dare I get their attention in such a way. I told the lady who came out that I had been waiting a while and just wanted to pick up my order. The lady did not apologize at all, but simply completed my transaction and then gave me a smart a$$ Have A Nice Day respond!"
1,"I'm not a big fan of LVAC, as I think that they are rude and uncaring to their customers.  \n\nThat being said, I signed up for a gym membership with them because I was desperate to lose weight after having surgery 2 years ago.\n\nI tend to go to this location around 5:30/6:00am.  Parking is never an issue, although I'm not one of those people who stalk others for a spot right by the door.  You're at the GYM.  You're going to EXERCISE. \nWalk an extra 50 feet.  It won't kill you, I promise.\n\nI usually go to the women's only gym, simply because at that time of the morning, its not packed, and I feel more comfortable without people leering at me.  \n\nBathrooms and locker rooms are spotless.  \n\nI work an unusual schedule, so I don't get to go to classes as often as I'd like, however, Marissa H's yoga classes (the Friday morning at 6 is AWESOME) are my favorite.  I've studied yoga off and on for years, but again, was inactive for about 2 years after my surgery.  Marissa is attentive, and provides alternatives and modifications for those of us who aren't quite up to some of the harder poses.  She is always available to give tips and pointers, and is a great person.  Love her.\n\nI've also taken the CXWorks class, which is a 30 minute ab class.  I died.  It was amazing.\n\nI'm giving this location 4 stars, because the employees HERE and the facility are good.   I am not a fan of their Corporate workers, as they are extremely insensitive and rude.  But this facility, I would recommend.  \nI pay $22 a month and can work out whenever I want, holidays included."
1,"I met my friend here for some drinks last weekend and it was lovely. I was lucky to meet Murphy and Cholla, their doggies who were hanging out. It's brick, and cute and fun. It's like a cozy, classy pub with no pretense. Nice, I am bringing some friends there soon so they can check it out."
0,"Wow how far this place has fallen, in such a short time. The douch bags on the phone seem to think that the  service and curiousness this place was built on no longer applies.\nI mean wow. \nThis was one of my most recommend places... Now it's a stay away. \nAs good as food can be, service or lack thereof is a reality, and their passion for indifference rates this place as a failed business."
1,fantastic food!! fantastic service (shannon)!!! gigantic portions!! excellent value!!! highly recommend!
0,"The location of this hotel is further than I thought and it's close to the older casinos on the strip but it was okay because we had a car. \r\nWhen we got to the hotel we noticed there was not a trashcan in sight. So we asked for one by calling the front desk. Minutes later a guy shows up and rudely questions \""What's the problem?\"" WTF? We told you the problem so bring us the freakin trash can!! (I HATE bad service!)\r\nSecondly, we notice there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom so after showers, the bathroom is incredibly humid and stuffy. \r\nThe next night, we noticed it was a bit warm in the room and came to the realization that the AC wasn't working. We made about 5 separate calls to the front desk for someone to come up (we were told that someone should be up within minutes and it was 115 degrees outside so we were irritated) It was after our fifth call when they told us we were getting a new room. Why didn't they just do that in the first place?\r\nThe last one was the one that took the cake. My sister saw yellow stains on the sheets so she peeled off the sheets and slept on top of the inside comforter but above the top cover. She and a friend got bug bites probably because of bed mites or other nasty critters. I slept on TOP of the covers so my bf and I were not parasited. Someone I know took hotel management and its a standard that the comforters don't get washed unless a VISIBLE stain was apparant. That is soooo nasty!!!!!! I'm just glad I didn't find a pubic hair in the sheets. \r\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this hotel. I think it would have been better if I slept in the car.."
1,"Went to see Strange Days, the tribute band for The Doors that have Robby Krieger as the lead guitar. !! Band was awesome. We sat in the balcony and had a great seat. The drinks are very expensive so take that into account before you get there as you can't bring any drinks in from the casino. I did smell mother nature half way thru the show which was appropriate for the mood that night. Had a great time !!"
1,Yeah we found it. We found the chisels we were looking for but not any books or patterns for acanthus carving.  We had fun visiting.
1,"I just took my children to see Dr. Cohen and he is fantastic with kids!  He is patient, and so knowledgeable.  They each gave him more than 10 stars which in our family is the best rating.  His staff is also very helpful and efficient."
1,"This place is awesome. The coffee is great and roasted in house. When the weather is nice, they have a great patio that faces the lake. The breakfast sandwich is made to order and you can taste the freshness.  Yum. Also they have live music at times on the evening and a bar."
1,"Alright Carrot Top, you got me. Friends surprised me with tickets, which was very nice, but I wasn't exactly sure if this show would be any good. I mean Carrot Top? I've always kind of figured him to be just ok. \n\nThe show was much better than I expected. Definitely worth the price. He starts off with funny one liners, one right after the other, using his random crazy props. He also pulls props from a \""new\"" bin and clearly uses current topics. The shows seems to be updated frequently. He even did some jokes about the days crazy weather. He then does some audience participation and even hands out some shots of Crown Royale to a the front row. Who does that? It's awesome!!!\n\nHe finishes up the show with a country music bit and then goes into a wild rock bit. I much preferred the beginning of the show to the finale, but all in all the show is pretty good. \n\nNote: The show is definitely not for everyone, as he makes a lot of inappropriate jokes. Personally, I think it adds to the show and I'm all for it... but maybe not the show to take your grandmother to see.\n\nAnother Note: the theatre is fairly small, so I don't think there's really a bad seat. We had excellent seats, almost exactly in the middle."
0,"If negative stars were available, this place would get them!!!! Absolute idiots. You have one job and that's to make a pizza and you can't even get that right. Not only were the toppings wrong but they didn't cut it either. I called them and they have very poor communication skills also!!!!! Dominos pizza is horrible anyways!!!! Can't even believe I ordered from there in the first place!!! So much for being close and convenient!!!!!!"
0,"This was my third visit.  The first two were fine but was really there again because it's a new place and fun to run into people there. Unfortunately my poor experience ruined the lunch with my friends so much that we've scheduled a do over - at another place, of course. First let me say that my friends LOVED the grilled cheese and soup they ordered. I ordered the steak frites (med rare). The fries were spectacular but the steak...not so much. It is served as a big chunk rather than thinly sliced. And, I could not cut through it. I asked for a steak knife - which it should have been served with. The server stayed to watch me cut it and even offered a suggestion - try cutting it through the side (as if he's seen the struggle before). That was the ticket, except that it was Med Well :(.  The second attempt was purple red Rare. After trying to cut the third attempt, I gave up.  They boxed it for me, offered no apology and kindly put it on my bill. NOT a good experience. Our visit was spoiled by the constant waiting, serving, and NOT eating. Applebee's wouldn't have charged me for a meal I was not satisfied with and did not eat...I expected more from Honey Salt."
0,"FIRST - let me premise the quality of their food is not at question nor the pricing for their food. What is at question is their staffing personnel and their customer service.  Our office is next door to this place and several times we have ordered from them, our simple orders are SCREWED UP EVERY TIME!  By simple I mean , no tomato on this sandwich and extra crispy bacon on that sandwich, not rocket science, right?  The 1st few times we ordered we wrote off the improperly made orders as maybe they were busy but the next 3 times we ordered we had to have them remake our orders!  Chris remade our order the 3rd time they screwed up and he apologized for the mix up by stating that alot of the \""guys don't speak, read or write English very well and they have had a lot of problems with the orders being wrong\"".  This LAST time (and it is definitely the LAST time we order from here!) we ordered 2 sandwiches both came made WRONG. I called to complain to the Manager, Tony,  and he said it was OUR FAULT not theirs that the orders were wrong!  We have never asked for a refund or been rude to them for THEIR mistakes, but that was the last straw! So, Tony ...YOU are WRONG! So just shut-up and sit there and be WRONG in your WRONGNESS. Because YOU and YOUR STAFF are WRONG!"
0,"I give this place a 5 star for food, but 1 star for service.\n\n We ordered 4 different tapas, as well as alcoholic beverages. The Sparkling Sangria was nice, lots of fresh fruit inside.  The stuffed dates are a must. Tuna Peppers were quite tasty with just the right amount of spice. The fish sticks were delicious with a nice sauce for dipping.  And the Lamb Skewers were also very good, cooked to perfection. \n\n However, once the waiter dropped off our food, he never checked in on us again. I expect a waiter to come by within at least 10 minutes of getting your food.  If he had, we would have ended up ordering another order of the stuffed dates, as well as another round or two of drinks.  But instead, 20 minutes after dropping off our food, we had to flag him down just to get our check.  It was not busy inside at all, so there was really no excuse for such crap service.  He had 0 personality, which was surprising considering his very exciting hair. \n\nBut like I said, the food was amazing, but our waiter ruined the whole experience.  I would come back, as long as I don't have him again."
0,We were Kona Grill lovers in the past but after visiting recently we dont want to anymore.  Our server took a while to give us attention. Our food took forever.  My husband's second order of beer never came. I had to get up and get my own napkin from the bar cuz she never came with it.  A lady on a near by table ended up leaving cuz her server never came to take her order and kept saying I will be right with you. The selection wasnt the same anymore although it still a good deal. We ate our order got up and went to Osaka's late night happy hour still.
1,"It's fun and Yummy!\n\nHad a blast with our group and our chef was impressive with his \""art\"" and funny too...\n\nFood was good, and surprising considering the chef was cooking it all there.\n\nFast! Fast service and delivery... It's not a place to string along a meal. You are served a lot o food and its one portion after another...\n\nI'm coming back."
1,"Las Palmas isn't just tacos, it's a way of life. \n\nThat being said, this place is AMAZING. $2.50 per taco?! Endless toppings?! Mexican coke in glass bottles?! Get outta town! This place has it all! By far one of my favorite places to eat...ever. The chicken tacos and the BBQ beef are my go-tos along with their salsa, pico de gallo, and endless lemons! I can't say enough good things about this place. You just need to experience it to truly believe it!\n\nJust as a sidenote, the salsa at the toppings bar aren't labeled...do yourself a favor (if you're not into spicy salsas) and avoid the deep red salsa. Unless you're SUPER into spicy (trust me, I'm a lover of spice, but I couldn't handle this salsa!), I would steer clear. I tried it once and it literally made my mouth hurt. Other than that, everything is solid and delicious! \n\nI'm constantly craving them. It's gotten so bad that I think of the amount of money I have in terms of how many tacos I can purchase at Las Palmas. So give it a go! You won't be sorry."
0,Did the easter brunch there.  Service was slow.  Food not good enough to visit again.
1,"Before my Vegas trip last week with my wife and my 5 year old son, i checked Yelp to find any activities or things we can do as a family, since my 5 year old isnt into drinking, partying or hitting up titty bars.\n\nI came across this place and said we had to try it cause it sounded and looked really cool. We came around 1 p.m. and it was pretty dead. I have to be honest and say it was really cool. Its pretty small but alot of little interesting things to do with kids. It is amazing how all those teeny tiny shops are made of big cargo containers. We didnt eat or anything, but we let our son draw on the wall and i basically just chased him around and played tag for about 30 minutes in the treehouse. I bet this place is really fun at night when its 21 and over. We only stayed about an hour cause we had a drive back to L.A. to get to. Ill definately come back when i come back to Vegas, also the employees around were all super nice."
0,Mr. English - After  reading the mix reviews onYelp I picked your establishment. You took my $$$ and in return you gave me 1. Poor service 2. Food that was (1-2) star level and 3.  a feeling my time is of no value to your business. I see a business model of why care about the customer they are tourist they will not return and new ones line up my  reputation will carry me through this moment is a bad one. If you want to see the fountain at the casino and a nice dinner consider the view from the casinos near by. Eating here is the equivant of being seated at a Craps table. You will have better odds at the other casinos near by.
0,This one sucks because its a franchise and everything is more expensive.:)
0,"Don't go to Manuels... food is BLAND ,then don't ask for anything extra like 2 tiny plastic cups of green sauce,,, $2.00. Frys has 8oz for $1.00.Taco bell is much better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Best airport food I have had in years!!!!  Burgers were hot, big and done as I asked.  Fries were hot and better than most fries at airports or others! Servers were cheerful and helpful and made a point  to tell us about free refills on drinks. A great stop if you're hungry in the Phoenix airport!"
1,"(Author's note: this review refers to the \""Cones\"" truck, not the \""Sticks\"" truck)\n\nI'm not typically a fan of soft-serve ice cream, but since the Cones truck of Sticks and Cones parks itself in front of Gateway Village on a weekly basis, I figured, what the hell, it's hotter than the surface of the sun right now, and nothing quenches heat like a nice cold ice cream, Well, there are other things that quench a thirst, but since there isn't a beer truck that caters to Gateway Village, an ice cream truck will do.\n\nBut hot damn, I do love me their soft-serve, so soft and gooey and not so sweet. The Cones specializes in soft-serve sundaes, and there are several different combinations to choose from. I opt for the Carolina Gold, a spectacular concoction complete with caramel topping, chocolate topping, white chocolate sauce, crushed vanilla wafers. Oh my! So sinful. Screw my diet!\n\nCheck 'em out when you get a chance. You'll find them Friday nights at the Food Truck Night on South End, and you won't regret it. So what are you waiting for? The Cones is a hell of a lot better than the junk served up at TCBY or any of the other obnoxious DIY yogurt joints flooding the market these day. Man, those places suck."
1,"Driving up you can't miss the retro storefront with random objects hanging from the knitted trees.\n\nA large parking lot providing free parking is located adjacent to their location surrounded by brightly colored walls covered in Dr. Seuss artwork.\n\nFrom the old time family photos on the wall to the random kitsch salt and peppers shakers, and the corner glass pastry case, walking into their establishment I felt as though I was stepping back in time.  I couldn't help but think how it would feel to live in Phoenix 15-20 years ago.\n\nWhile there aren't a ton of tables in the diner we were successful in finding ourselves a seat and sat ourselves.  Most of their food isn't typical fare since they don't try to replicate burgers and such.  Instead they take their own twist on things.  However, they're 'twists' aren't so off the wall that a person looking for something 'normal' won't find anything.\n\nWithin a few moments our waitress was at our table taking our order. 'Koo Koo Banana Pancake's for me and vegan 'Bwiscuits and Gwavy' for my husband.  We took our time enjoying the photos on the wall as we waited for our food.  We also took a gander at the glass case full of cookies and pies.  Our service was speedy and it took little time for our dishes to arrive.\n\nI love pancakes.  Add in some sugar & rum caramelized bananas and I was experiencing a little slice of heaven.  Sadly my husband didn't have the same experience as he found his dish to be pretty bland.   I made sure to grab a few bites and honestly thought it was pretty darn good.  So, while he didn't care for his entree we both chalked it up to his personal tastes."
1,"I absolutely love how it's outdoors. I love being out in the sun, especially when there are misters to keep you cool. This place has tons of yummy restaurants, a great theater that has student discount, and lots of places to buy cute clothes. They also have a stage where local bands provide entertainment.  Being that it's outside, you can even bring your dog. This is one of my favorite malls."
0,"This place should be called Lobster Meh.  My friend and I were shopping at the mall and decided to try this place.  She is a lobster bisque connoisseur, but trying it was a disappointment.  It tasted of roux with a little lobster base. What it did have going for it was a lot of cryovac lobster pieces in it.  The lobster mac and cheese was alright, but void of any real lobster meat, although it was garnished here and there with some of the same lobster pieces they used in the bisque.  \n\n I ordered a long island iced tea and the cashier kept trying to push this fishbowl vessel on me.  I'm a local and I will not be seen walking around holding and drinking out of a fishbowl.  The drink was mostly sweet and sour mix  anyway.  \n\nSave your money and dine elsewhere as this place is highly overrated and overpriced."
1,"Good location, good food, a little pricey, okay service. Will go back for the fresh subs!!"
1,"I'm updating my review to 4. They did reach out to me and helped rectify the situation. I'm going to give them another go and won't let one bad experience ruin the potential future fun we have at the Wigwam. \n\nWe were there for Easter Brunch yesterday. I thought after a day I would be 'over it' but I am still mad about the whole experience.\n1. I called in early April to make my reservation. We went over it a few time, 5 adults and 2 high chairs, for a total of 7. When we were brought to our table yesterday, there were 5 chairs. It then proceeded to take 4 servers and 10 min to figure out how to get us two high chairs.\n2. On the phone with the reservation woman, she suggested we sit at 9am, so that we could take our little boys on the Easter egg hunt at 10am. I thought great, we didn't come last year because the boys couldn't walk yet but this year was going to be really exciting - their first egg hunt. WELL, the Easter egg hunt was on SATURDAY, not SUNDAY. So why the hell did she have me schedule our brunch time around an egg hunt that wasn't happening? Not to mention, if I had known it was Saturday - well, we could have brought the boys.\n3. When we arrived for Brunch, they were running behind and didn't even seat us at 9am, our reservation time. Probably about 9:10. \n4. We had not 1, not 2, but 3 server changes in the first half hour of being there. They were lazy, they never took our plates - I brought dirty plates to a tray I saw set up, they screwed up our drink order of 2 teas and 3 coffees (HOW EASY). Their speech was extremely unprofessional and after dropping off the drinks we hardly saw them again. \n5. There was a 20% tax for the piano guy? We couldn't even hear him, we were outside. \n6. The food was MEDIOCRE. My prime rib was dry. There were NO egg dishes except 1 person running an omelet stand - which I didn't want to wait 20 min for. How about just a warmer with some scrambled eggs or quiche??\n7.  I was also told if we sat on the patio it would be covered. The umbrellas out there were a joke. We had to drag our own table to try to get most of us in the shade. I explicitly asked when I made the reservation if the patio was covered because we had little ones and elderly in our group.\n\nOverall, I will never return here for Easter Brunch again. Very disappointing. I'm disgusted in what we paid, for this experience."
0,"Went out with some coworkers last friday to chicas bonitas. We had a pretty good time,  with the exception of having to wait 20 mins for a jager bomb. I proceeded to wake up with strep, shoulda skipped the bomb. I may go back, but i will not touch the glassware"
1,So f***ing good
1,Very Friendly and cheap!  I thought the meat was great as was the sauces.  Some of the vegetables were meh but thats just my opinion.  Overall I am surely coming back
0,45 dollars to wash my new car and they did not even get it clean  I have tried them three times now a complete waste of Time  retarded monkeys can wash cars better than them. And now I have a dent on the roof of my show car thanks you dumb asses
0,"Two and a half stars, neither A-ok nor real bad. \nI was at Carolina Place around 1:30 pm and decided to give this restaurant a try -I was told it's the best Eyetalian in Charlotte.\n\nFirst the good part: I ordered the baked rigatoni with meat sauce and hot Italian sausage. It was excellent -if like me you like strong flavors and spicy both- nothing I'd expect from a chain restaurant. The lunch portion was huge, too much in fact.\nthat's it for the good.\n\nService was absolutely dismal for no good reason. It was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch. I think the dinner prices are very high for Southern Italian style pasta dishes, especially considering we're in Charlotte and I think their idea of \""family dining\"" makes life easier for the cook but does nothing for the customer. \n\nMy idea of fun dining is exactly the opposite, I want to taste as many different things I can, not pig out on a mound of carbs."
0,"I am so glad that we didn't order more from them. We had the mixed shishkabob plate, the sausage and kraut balls, and split the Atwood burger. My partner had a beer. The shishkabobs were under-seasoned and over cooked, the only one either of us enjoyed at all was the sausage one, probably because you can't mess up sausage too badly. The burger was the same story. They advertise onions and caraway seeds and other yummies on that burger. What came out of the kitchen was an undersized patty with a few caraway seeds in the entire thing and a tiny smudge of onions on top. We expected something much more flavorful and powerful. The beer, I was told was excellent for the first few sips and then started to leave a bad taste in his mouth. A third of the way through the glass and he would have thrown it away if we had been at home. Now those things I could forgive for a new place but here is the kicker. The pork sausage and sauerkraut were over done on the outside and raw on the inside. When I told the waiter to let the kitchen staff know that their frier was too hot (I have been frying for 10 years), he let them know and then came back and told us that the balls were supposed to be pink on the inside. I'm curious. How can a product comprised of a brown or green vegetable and a meat that is brown when properly cooked, be pink unless it was raw? Not only is that wrong, but that is a safety issue. We will not be going back and we will not be recommending it to anyone. Save yourself some money and possibly illness and avoid this place."
1,Been frequenting this place weekly now for about 2 months. $5 daily specials can't be beat! Food is authentic Mexican style and very flavorful. Service is very good. Come hungry as portions are BIG! (Even with the $5 specials) I've recommended a few friends here and they enjoy it as well.
1,"Braddah's is catering our upcoming wedding and they have been SO amazing to work with. They are working with me to create the perfect build your own taco bar and it has been a completely stress free and awesome experience. And SUCH good prices!!!! I've had the food and it's delicious, the huli huli chicken and the kahlua pork are tasty and succulent. And the coconut bark - OMG words cannot describe it's tastiness. Definitely try it. I love supporting this place because it's a true mom and pop joint... not a giant faceless chain."
0,"Probably the WORST sushi restaurant we have EVER been to. The sushi was warm, looked old. The California roll was obviously not made to order and was thinner than a quarter. I ordered a glass of $9 white wine and was given a VERY small pour.The atmosphere was every uninviting at best. The table was sticky and the candles on the table were battery operated but none of them worked. The music was horrible....they were playing tacky techno.....why? If I wanted to watch sports I would go right next door instead of being forced to watch it on every TV they had. Oh, and it was so HOt inside that we were actually sweating! I left the restaurant disappointed and mad that I wasted the $50 especially these days, when times are tough and eating out is a rare event. SAVE YOUR MONEY EVERYONE. This place is horrible."
0,"David David David....Two sides to every coin.  Mr. Copperfield has acquired a lifetime of success doing \""illusions\"" or tricking people into believing one thing while he does another (I'm not terribly fond of magic, but can be entertained).  You can tell he's been doing it wayyyyyyyyyyyyy too long, he just didn't seem into it............at all.  It's as though he was on auto-pilot.  \n\nThere were a few cool tricks, especially when the car appears on the stage (sweet ride btw).  \n\nHowever, I laughed quite heartily through out the show.  He had a few parts that almost caused me to fear bladder problems.  Would I have paid for tickets if I didn't get them comped? Umm, no. \n\nBefore he 'appeared' on stage, there was a tedious \""DAVID COPPERFIELD\"" tribute video, it was cool the first few minutes...but daaaaang dude, ease up, we don't need to see every SINGLE show clip that your name was mentioned in.\n\nIt was ok.  I think he's a handsome older man, but his fake hair was awfully distracting.  Thirty minutes of the show was spent trying to figure out if it was sprayed on or astro-turf."
0,"My wife and I went in around lunch time. There was literally no one there and no one acknowledged that we were there for several minutes. There was only one item in the entire glass case. We stood around awkwardly until we saw the laminated menus in the holder on the wall. \n\nWe decided to try a juice before we ate so I ordered a carrot-orange juice. It was about $5 and came out luke-cold. I felt pretty disappointed at that point to we left. \n\nIt is a really cool looking place but the service and food seemed really sub-par, especially for the price. I see a lot of positive reviews so I may try this place again but my time there was definitely a 1-star experience."
0,"I am not even going to waste my time or your time in going on about how sad this place is. You're better off going to Tabu at MGM, trust me. \n\nThis place could have such better potential, maybe actually going through all the way with the \""rock\"" image. But what do I know? All the nightclubs in Vegas are the same..."
1,"I helped my friend decide on this Hotel when she came to visit from Colorado. She was traveling with 3 kids and needed an affordable place that still had a lot to offer and Gainey did not disappoint. \n\nThey serve a FREE Breakfast buffet and FREE nightly appetizers and drinks everyday. With her 3 kids this was such a money saver! \n\nThe breakfast was actually decent, lots of fresh fruit and pastries to choose from along with cereal, oatmeal, toast even eggs, potatoes, pancakes and bacon! Selections varied each day. Juices and coffee were also included. \n\nAt night they had Free Beer on Tap and Wine along with fresh salads, veggies and dips, chips, pretzels , popcorn and hot appetizers like egg rolls. \nNot to mention the basket of Paradise Bakery Chocolate Chip Cookies they have at the front desk for your complimentary enjoyment! \n\nI'm really happy that this Hotel was so much better than I expected it to be. I ended up staying a couple of nights with them and I was really pleased. \n\nWe had the 2 bedroom King/King Suite. Accented with Granite and Stone, Even the Kitchen with nice wood floors. There was a total of 3 flat screen TV's and FREE Wi-Fi as well! Also came with Bath Amenities from Bath and Body Works and a couple of cute teddy bears to take home. \nEverything was really new,clean feeling and comfortable and at only $185 it was such a Steal! \n\nThe pool was nice and had lots of pretty trees and flowers around it and we basically had the pool to ourselves the whole time we were there!! LOVED THAT! \n\nThere is small fitness room on site but if you take advantage of their FREE 5mile shuttle service you can go just up the street to the Gainey Village Spa and Fitness Center and use their equipment. \n\nAlthough there is no in house restaurant here you are literally walking distance to the shops and restaurant at Gainey Village. \n\nEven though this place is obviously not a 5 star resort I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to have a clean comfortable stay, it has recently been renovated and has so many perks to help you save money! \n\nMy friend and I will be staying here again next time she visits for sure!"
0,I ordered the chocolate pizza for the sheer curiosity of it.  My two stars are really for the pizza itself as thats the only thing i got and from the cashier outside so didn't dine-in. The pizza crust was too thick for my liking and chocolate wasn't enough. It was just ok. Would try something else though.
1,"Some of the best vegan takeout I've ever had! Lots of choices and all are delicious. Depending on the time of day and the amount of orders they have received, it can take a while to prepare. Its better to call ahead. Definitely worth the wait even if you don't.\nKind of wish they had a restaurant so I could eat in sometimes."
1,First time visiting this place and it's awesome!  I'm surprised I never came across it sooner.  Sandy took care of me today and I will definitely be back:-)
0,"Today was a free meal for us provided as an apology from the manager.  About three weeks ago we were on this side of town seeking emergency food.  A long day and it was after my 9 year old's bedtime.  Probably about 9 o'clock.  The service was so horrible I parked my car and walked in to complain.  Instead of offering to make things right I was met with a blank stare.  I basically cussed as I walked out with the wrong order bc it was about 9:20 and my poor kid need to get to sleep so I let her eat the nuggets as we drove home.\n\nOk so let's move beyond the horrible visit of the past and talk about this visit.\n\nI was ignored by the only person at the counter when I walked in.  The next guy acknowledged us as he was zooming off to the back of the kitchen area.  They were pleasant, not pleased about giving me free food and had to go \""check\"" with someone in back.  I actually didn't call to complain so I'd get free food.  I called and complained because if they keep acting that way some hot tempered diner is gonna get belligerent in here.  (like in that one YouTube video lol)  They need to change their ways and actually practice better customer service skills.\n\nI smiled cracked jokes and treated them all very nicely the entire time I was there, I even offered to pay a different in what we ordered and what they were told we were supposed to be given.  They turned it down but seemed to feel better about themselves since I offered to pay.  I'm not poor, I can pay for my food dang it!.\n\nAnyway, food.  Fries and fish were piping hot.  Anything else was heat lamp temperature but still edible.  I am from Louisiana and I've seen a Popeye's funnel thousands of people through in a short amount of time.  I know things can be better than what I've seen at this location lately.  \n\nWill I come here again?  Probably, if I am desperate and they are open.\nReally?  I honestly don't seem myself visiting this particular location anytime in the next year.  I just don't have the time for slow service and mediocre food.  \n\nThe appearance of the store was mediocre.  Not dirty but definitely not clean.  Crumbs on almost every table and super slow service considering we were one of two customers ordering (drive thru and dining room).  \n\nIf i am being completely honest, the visit was kind of depressing.  I remember when Popeye's was a special occasion in my family because we were very poor and didn't go out much to eat.  It always reminds me of my mom, brother and I enjoying chicken that was too hot to even touch but we couldn't help try to eat it before it was cool.  \n\nThis Popeye's reminds me of a stripper working far past her prime.  Someone give this chick some clothes and teach her a skill because clearly this ain't working anymore."
1,"This review covers my first and only experience here so far.  The emphasis is on what I enjoyed the most, though I'm rating everything.  When I'm visiting a place for the first time I want to experience as much as reasonably possible and some of what is unreasonably possible.  In a place like this it is going to be difficult not to break the diet and when POPROCK LOVE is doing the ordering it may be better to forget it anyway!\n\nSmall and tight or cozy and intimate?  How about: \""Hello would it be alright if we share your table\"" or \""is anyone sitting hear, OK we are\"".  I actually LOVE dinning with strangers, only here the strangers are not going to be strange at lunchtime on a week day.  That is OK too and I'm with POPROCK LOVE so who cares what these other people are talking about!\n\nStarting with my favorite at Sauceman's: Best Collard Greens I have ever tasted 5 yelp stars!  Vinegar Sauce - this is a very simple version and one of my favorites, thin and spicy with great flavor 5 yelp stars.  FRESH Hush-puppies ok forget the diet super delicious 4.5 stars.  Red Slaw (no Mayo YAY!) good flavor 4.25 stars.  \n\nWe are not just here for the BBQ, though since I LOVE Great BBQ it is an important part of the review.  We split (I always eat more) one small BBQ tray of Coarse Chopped Pork BBQ.  The Flavor was very good, not great.  It was too Fatty for me. Still the flavor was very good 3.9 stars (only because I'm not quite a fan).\n\nThe rest of this review is where I was disappointed:  The Mac and Cheese was almost A-OK (would not get it again) almost 3 stars.  The Fried Green Tomatoes had great flavor though the Batter was way too thick 3 stars.  The Fried Pickles lacked flavor and again the thickness of the batter ruined it for me 2 stars.  I like BBQ Sauces and Sauceman's has one - the other two I was very disappointed in.  If a place has one great sauce that is all I need, so to me it is no big deal that I did not care for Sauceman's (too Mustardy) Mustard, nor (too sweet) Sweet BBQ sauces, someone else may think they are perfect."
1,"What a find on the corner of Shea and N. scottsdale Blvd.  Great tasting food, great service, great menu.  The pizza was to die for and did not upset the senior stomach.  The broasted chicken, the best ever, the spaghetti w sausage or meatball fantastic using a home made sauce.  Cannot say anything less about this place with some outside seating.   If your looking for fantastic food in a none formal setting, this is the place.  I will definitely return to this one."
0,"first time here was a year ago. went with 2 of my friends, and we ended up going to their walk-up counter because the wait for an inside table was about an hour. we ordered small frozen hot chocolate. \n\ni must say - i wasnt really impressed. it tasted like a chocolate shake with sprinkles. maybe its better if you go inside to order it? i dont know...\n\nsecond time i met some friends in town. they were eating dinner (i didnt eat because i just ate). everything looked really good and portions were pretty decent as well. \n\nthird time we went in was a few weeks ago with my sister and some friends back home. ordered a frozen hot chocolate and a frozen white hot chocolate. i couldnt remember how big they were or how \""eh\"" they were, but my sisters never been and we were already there. my sister ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two because her and her boyfriend were gonna share it. and it was waaaaaaaaaaay too much frozen hot chocolate! and as rich as it is, you really dont need anymore than a small. \n\nservice was alright - the cashier there was a little slow at ringing in orders/putting the tickets up on the rail. and it seemed they were short staffed or something because the girl making the drinks seemed overwhelmed the whole time we were there. agian, maybe the hype was built up so much i expected a lot?\n\nmaybe i'll come back, stick out the wait and eat inside?"
1,"Being skeptical of spray tans, I was hesitant to try Sun Gun. This is place is amazing. The staff is excellent, inviting and most of all good at what they do. It's a super modern and exceptionally clean place. The product is absolutely the best. You won't be disappointed."
1,"Love the staff of laser dental... they are very professional, always greet you with a smile, helpful,attentive to their patients needs....and would highly recommend it to everyone who is looking for a good/reliable dental clinic.."
1,"It's official, Im a big fan of this salon. Skaught really knows his stuff and is a true artist! When you walk in you are welcomed to enjoy the hip fun and relaxing atmosphere! Specializing in Bumble to Bumble and staying up to date with technique and trend, you are sure to get a personalized experience. I just love what they did with my hair!!! Check them out!"
1,"The last time I was in this building it was someone else's pop-up location.  Suffice to say this is no pop up, and they're here to stay.  The make over is a unique take on shabby chic, but it's clear there's been nothing shabby about the budget.\n\nFood fusion is the menu - with an emphasis on spicing up the simplest of things and making them into hot little numbers.  The onion bah-gees - accompanied by onion rings - is a dish that's definitely for onion lovers.\n\nI'm a lover of quips and quirks. Hence the chalked up sign with an arrow pointing to \""Lavvys\"" made me chuckle.  The cleanliness made me smile too.  Wash your hands and return to the bar.  It might be the Potting Shed, but there's no emphasis on elderflower and burdock wine, though I wouldn't be surprised to find home-made nettle soup one of these days.  A bit short on the soft drinks front, but no complaints from the beer drinking and cocktail quaffing clientele.\n\nIf spicy isn't your bag, check out the burgers.  I did, and I'm happy to recommend.  The management tell me they may be spreading their wings, so watch out for a Potting Shed near you.  They're friendly enough - and didn't even bat an eyelid when the lethal combination of paper napkin, candle, and Simon came to it's inevitable climax.  I can confirm, all that garden shed styled interior is completely non-flammable."
1,"They do have a resource room with a special ed specialized teacher.  I have really appreciated working with the team on my child's IEP.  Can they serve all students' IEPs?  No.  They do not have the full services that a traditional CCSD school.  So, to expect it is a little ridiculous."
0,"Not worth it, eat somewhere else. We bought a day pass thinking maybe breakfast was a fluke. It wasn't, and there is one thing I have to say abou this place : GROSS !"
1,Thanks Wendy C for recommending this buffet. The cooked crab was delish. I had devoured two plates of crab and shrimp cooked in buttery spicy sauce! If you get there early you won't have any wait in line for the crab to be cooked to order. \n\nAs is the problem with any buffet in Vegas there was way to just to much food! Prime rib was decent and the fried chicken was crunchy and tasty. I did save room for a small piece of Strawberry cheesecake! \n\nI probably would not return BC I'm not a big Buffet fan but would recommend this one if your into buffets.
1,"My family moved apartments recently, just a few blocks down the street. We chose Erik's based on the reasonable-sounding price ($295 for the minimum of 2 guys and 3 hours, then $65 for each extra hour). \n\nThe movers were friendly and professional and quick. They loaded our pretty sizable apartment into the truck in 2 hours and got it all moved into the new place within another 2 hours. The guys did a great job getting all our furniture up and down stairs and around corners without banging or scratching things.\n\nThe guys said they couldn't take checks, but were fine with cash or credit card.\n\nMy only concern: When we called a few weeks ago to book the movers, we were told to expect them at noon... but on moving day, they actually showed up at 9am. I'm really glad that we could move earlier, but we weren't 100% ready, so we had to rush to pack a few last things, strip the bed sheets, etc. while the guys were already hauling stuff into the truck.\nI also wish the office had called us a day before the move to confirm everything. It would have been great for peace of mind.\n\nSo, that's a minor concern about the dispatcher or whoever at the office. But the movers themselves were great. We will definitely use them again next time we need to move (though hopefully not for a while!)"
1,"This is going to read as if I am a paid shill of Number 1, however, I most definitely am not. I spoke with Linda in the office and was very professional.  More importantly, she was patient and kind (two elements of professionalism that are often forgotten). She was going to call the service guys and then call me back. She forgot the second part, but I am confident that she would have remembered. I called back about 40 minutes after our initial conversation and I could hear phones ringing off the hook in the background...obviously, these folks stay busy.  She apologized profusely and said she would verify who was coming and when, and call me. Within 5 minutes, she did, indeed, call me.  Moments later, the service guy, Leon, called to tell me where he was so I could gauge when he would be here.  \n\nLeon was amazing.  I was completely freaking out on the inside because I know A/C repairs are expensive. Leon figured out the problem in something like 3 seconds after he removed the panel from my condenser unit. I needed a new capacitor. Totally not a big deal. Phew!  He did tell me that the bearings were going out on the fan, which I know to be true.  He didn't try to sell me a new system.  He did tell me what my options were for when the system needs to be replaced (after I asked), and his opinion was obviously based on his experience as an HVAC tech.  I will be purchasing my upgraded system from Number One.\n\nI also needed a pound of refrigerant, which was no surprise.  As a result of Leon's efforts, I am sitting in a deliciously cool house instead of sweltering in 80+ degrees.\n\nIf Leon and LInda are representative of Number One, and I believe they are, then this is a company you can absolutely trust.  No one wants to worry about being ripped off, and there is no need to have that concern when dealing this Number One.  There is a reason that their Yelp rating is so high.\n\nDon't be hot when your A/C goes out in the Las Vegas summer and you KNOW you can't afford an astronomical repair bill.  Just call Number One.  They will take care of you!!!"
0,I also wish I could give a negative review. I understand New Years is a difficult night to get a cab. Which is why I called a week ahead to make the reservation. Even then I should have known they were horrible. They told me they couldn't guarantee the time but they would arrive at the address I provided. They also said they would call when they were on their way. I then called the day of to confirm my reservation and was told they had it and would be there. I told my friend I was worried about them showing up and she called and made a reservation as well. They NEVER SHOWED UP! Not my call or hers and they never called. They are a HORRIBLE company and if you need to go somewhere do not rely on them. It would be worth it to call Classy Cab or book a private car.
0,"Really gorgeous rooms, great bathrooms...even if we did find a (new!) condom hidden under the telephone. I guess some poor guy didn't get as lucky as he hoped. I agree with most of the reviews that the maid service is generally on the piss-poor side--very inconsistent cleaning times, almost never taking away old dishes in the hall, unfriendly attitude, etc.\n\nThe customer service is really the problem here. This place is obviously just too massive for anyone to really give a damn. We had to call downstairs for extra sheets for the sofa, and had to call back twice because it took close to 2 hours. We called to get a fridge (they charge) and that took hours, too.\n\nWorst of all, like SO MANY reviewers on her, my friend accidentally left her $400 Stuart Weitzman boots in the room...gone, gone, gone. (She had even left a huge tip for the cleaning crew, so oh well.) Based on the other reviews here, I seriously doubt they even HAVE a lost and found. The number of reviews where valuables are **actively stolen while people are simply out of the room**, however, is a huge red flag. I think there is a safe in the closet, but that's hardly comforting.\n\nThe shopping is great here, the faux-Venice canals are fun, the casino is pretty great (I'm not a huge casino person but I thought it was fun)--but yes, the drink service is ABYSMALLY slow in the casino. Sort of pointless really. The pool is also nice, but due to where it is placed, it never received any sun and I honestly don't think it does any time of year. Kind of baffling. The 2 spas are pretty nice, it was just a shame when they were overridden by fratty punks.\n\nVegas has a near-daunting amount of choices, why settle for a place that has these kinds of problems when there are so many BETTER places?"
1,"great show!!\n\nsaw this show 2 times, ****doug aldrich**** was excellent, the whole experience is a must if you are in vegas!!!\nthe whole band is amazing.. you will get lost in their performances and the time capsule show  has the funniest lead actor!\n\nimportant- do vip if you can.. it's the best backstage vip tickets i have ever purchased!!!\na unique and amazing- friendly group of the most talented musicians today!!!\n\nwill be back.. :))"
0,"Upon arrival, I had a really good impression of this place.  It was clean, it was cozy and it was private; at least that's what I thought until morning time when I found out that the walls were very thin and I could hear practically every word from our neighbors.  Even worse on my last night there, a new set of neighbors were arguing their lungs out at 7:00am waking me up bright and early and losing an hour of extra sleep.  This has to be the first Vegas hotel that I've stayed at where the walls are built this way.  I'd expect that at some run down hotel but not in Vegas.  Another small complaint I have is that the water in the shower takes at least 3 minutes to start getting warm.  This could have just been my room but was rather annoying.  It would have been worse if it never turned warm at all and would have had to take a cold shower.  Here's a quick run-down:\n\nPros:\n-Clean room\n-Has nice extras like coffee-maker and an actual refrigerator which is a bit rare\n-Easy access and parking (which is probably why most people highly rate it)\n\nCons:\n-Thin walls which means no privacy and more conversation than talk radio\n-Water in shower takes a little while to get warm but I guess that's more of an annoyance than anything\n\nBottom Line: I can't stay here again.  The room can be gorgeous but if the walls don't provide decent privacy in terms of sounds, it's a complete failure in my opinion.  It's rather surprising they chose to built the rooms this way but I suppose 2 out 10 people may not mind."
0,"It was average food. Kind if boring. Too many huge chunks of jalape\u00f1o in the guacamole. The quesadilla my mom got was Inedible, full of way undercooked mushrooms. My quesadilla was cheese and it was good. The bean burrito was just what seemed like canned refried beans. It just wasn't that good. I miss Cancun!"
1,"Stayed here with wifey last year for my birthday. Room was clean and spacious. Restaurants were plentiful and the breakfast buffet was on point. Hit it up two mornings in a row. Only con was the long wait for the elevators, especially after 4pm. Didn't get to check out the pool/beach though. \nSide note: On the night we checked in, as we were getting on the elevator, Manny Pacquiao was getting off it. Awesome start to the trip. This was one night before his 3rd fight with Juan Manuel Marquez"

0,"My daughter and I went here for dinner to celebrate an occasion that only happens once in a lifetime, Retirement, for me of course. She told me to pick out any place that was different and unique. I searched high and low and behold, II Vinaio.\n\nMy daughter didn't sound too pleased of my choice because of her culinary skills and wide range of unique eating establishments but she agreed and we arrived at our reservation time. We could have got away without the reservation.\n\nOur server was very prompt and recited the specials without hesitation, we selected the assorted cheese plate and alligator sausage with some kind of fritter for starters.\nThe cheese platter had an assortment of 3 different cheeses,olives,fruit,nuts,and not enough small toasted bread slices to accommodate all the cheese. The alligator sausage was good but was it really alligator sausage? Not that I eat it all the time,so am I an expert on alligator ? but it was good if it was gator. And any type of batter that is thrown into hot oil is always tasty, the fritter.\n\nThe cheese platter was good because the cheese comes from outside vendors and placed on a plate with the proper condiments how can you go wrong,a no brainier here. \nMy dinner choice was Crispy Prime Pork Loin over fontina risotto and caper berry sauce.That was another disappointment in my life .I also have a large repertoire of fine foods and this was not it. The plating would not have won an academy for best picture because the pounded out paper thin panko crusted pork cutlet was place on top of the dollop size portion of risotto and ugh. \n\nOur server promptly asked us how was the food and I told her that the pictures posted on this site sure didn't look like what I ordered. She told me that those pictures were posted a long time ago and things have changed. Well honey, that's the reason I came here, the pictures of the food were amazing.\nI've eaten pork loin before, not only in restaurants but I also cook a mean pork roast myself. This was not it!!! All I tasted was panko bread crumbs, where's the pork??\n\nLong grain rice (risotto) with melted cheese, I've had better.\nMy daughter has some kind of salad, just an assortment of greens with venison, nothing special.\n\nThe two glasses of Bordeaux were alright but were they Bordeaux? \nMy daughter should have paid the bill with a picture of a credit card and II Vinaio should have a disclaimer posted on their front door that reads, What you see you may not get."
0,"I love sprinkles but holy moly is this a poorly designed store. Customers have no idea where to go, for the ice cream flavors are by the exit so you have to try to reach over the people paying to grab a menu a rope and maybe an employee giving menus would work. Second complaint, tons of workers and only 2 people ahead of me yet it took over 15 mins to get them, the ice cream line was a bit better. Instead of doing a good job employees just kept apologizing for their screw ups. Cupcakes great as usual, will just use ATM from now on if I ever go to this one again."
0,"This place will definitely try your patience, food is good enough, but yet slow. I guess made to order, maybe a tad overpriced, but it's a drive thru. Live about a mile away and cringe when the wife says \"" Let's get Sonic \"" cause I know what's in store. The reviews are right. Orders are consistently wrong, the wait times, all of it. Past 10 years have been back, maybe once a month. Like I said patience will be tested, check your order before you leave the window, I have returned many times to just wait in the line again. And have found I drive a lot crazier leaving there wondering what just happened, EVERY time"
1,"Those geniuses at Einsteins keep thinking up new and improved menu items to keep me coming in! The bagel poppers rock for breakfast (think tiny bagel nuggets with a dipping sauce), and my new favorite lunch is the bagel thin sandwich. I recently had the Turkey Bacon & Avocado Bagel thin (under 400 calories) and it was fabulous! Apparently I should clarify \""turkey bacon\"" = \""turkey bacon\"" not turkey & bacon - if you check yelp reviews in other cities this confusion gets people upset . The avocado was quality and it had a yummy chipotle mayo type thing on it that gave it a great flavor. I got it with some delicious chili... a relatively light satisfying lunch!"
1,"Let me tell you somethin!! I wish I had never found this daggone place! The cupcakes and sweets are simply irresistible! Whhyyyyyyy? LOL Homeade icecream too! And it doesn't  just look good (like some other bakeries I know) it is deelish! Definitely not the place you want to be on any type of diet. Sandwiches, wine, coffee, the works!  Quaint, cute and the staff is super friendly! Unfortunately for me and my hips...this is one of my new favorite places! SMH"
0,Best buy on the west side of madison has a serious problem with the quality of the pavement for their parking lot. Every lane has a pothole the is at least 2 feet wide. Also I thought that the staff not knowing what the internet sale was pretty sad.
0,"I can only speak on behalf of Dr. Barry Chang, Pediatric Urology.\n\nI understand there are many doctors at this facility so the reviews may be all over the place.\n\nIt all started once we got there, we waited over an hour to be seen past our \""appointment time\"".  When we finally got to see the doctor, he was very short, in a hurry and didn't really help us understand the process, risks involved, etc.   \n\nRegardless, we decided to have them check our insurance to verify everything would be covered and the out of pocket expense prior to scheduling the surgery. \n\nIt took several months for them to get back to us, despite multiple phone calls."
1,"What a find! I came here with friends for a late lunch and we were all blown away! The service was friendly and the food was amazing. Sadly the curries were non-vegetarian(curry usually has fish sauce or shrimp paste etc) but they even had a pumpkin curry which I would have loved to try! I ended up getting a spicy eggplant dish that was delicious. I can't wait to go back and take my husband. If you like Thai food this is probably the best in Pittsburgh. Also, the Thai iced tea is to die for."
1,"Love this place!  I go about once a week.  I get the pulled pork sandwich every time and I rotate the sides.  Try the mac-n-cheese - it's AWESOME!  Oh, and BTW, definitely get the spicy BBQ sauce.  Thank God I finally found a good BBQ place in Tempe."
0,"I ordered their Chicken Waldorf sandwich on wheat bread and a half salad. The chicken waldorf was excellent; big chunks of chicken with cranberries and nuts - yum! The wheat bread was huge - think texas toast size - which made it very difficult to eat two slices as a sandwich. I eventually threw the bread aside and just ate the chicken salad out of it with a fork.\n\nThe half salad was bad. No, really bad. The lettuce was not fresh and I had a lot of pieces of lettuce that had the hard white vein running through the middle of the leaf. Ick. They don't have french dressing so I went with the honey mustard which was another bad choice. I took two bites and threw it away - there went $3!\n\nFor the amount of money I spent (total was almost $10!) and for the amount of food and the quality I received - the next time I'm going elsewhere."
1,"Again, this is a great place that serves great food. Since they remodeled, they can seat more people. The food might take a while in the small kitchen but it is worth the wait. I have always had good service here along with good food quality. I HATE when people give places One Star solely based on the service and not the food. I understand the service goes in hand with the food but the food is more important to me. I know these mom and pop places are struggling and it is a hard business to operate just to make a living--give them a break! They are working all the time. I know most of you don't work 80 hours plus a week on your feet. I surely don't and that is why I have respect for these hard working business owners. (replying to the lady Stacey L with a small to go box) There are two sides to a story and unfortunately only one side was told."
1,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle style...AWESOME!  Just went here for the first time to study and munch and this place is absolutely rad-tastic.  I threw down for a 2 topping pizza and it was college poor kid priced with 5 star taste.  Richly was super chill and helpful in the selection process as well as accommodating for whether we need the rest of our pizza boxed.  It's a neighborhood pizza joint but for a first timer I thought I was a return customer and constant patron with how Rich took care of us.  Great selection of pizza pies and toppings are right priced. Def no more Frozen pizzas or delivery for this dude because I will go out of my way to grab a stellar pie from Pizza Re.  Thanks you for a grrreat experience and y'all def have a customer for life.
1,"Love the Green Chille Burger. Can't say about the other food because I haven't tried anything else. Last time I went the fries were undercooked, but you can ask them to cook them well done. \nThey have great fries but for some reason they decided not to cook them as much. \nGreat atmosphere, with several easy to see T.V.s"
0,"No.  Just, no.\n\nI went here because I had a coupon for pizza (they confusingly operate a pizza joint that is really the same place but for some reason they call it Snaggle's Pizza and pretend it's different but they don't but they do but - hell, don't ask), and I was anything but impressed.\n\nI showed up right at the time they promised my pizza and ended up sitting around for over twenty minutes.  Because I had prepaid (it was on Groupon), I figured I'd better wait around to get what I paid for.  While sitting there I was treated to a pretty mundane bar experience with little in the way of atmosphere, though plenty in the way of grungy.\n\nAnyway, this review is about the separate but not really separate but separate but, well, never mind that.  This is about their pizza.  The pizza finally came after twenty minutes of waiting passed their promised time, and when I got it, it was probably the worst pizza I've ever had: including frozen pizza.  The crust was super thin, which isn't bad on its own, but it also had zero flavor (it tasted frozen and waterlogged) and was either overcooked in some areas or soggy in others.  There was virtually no sauce on the pizza, which made choking down the crust especially difficult.  As far as the toppings go, they tasted stale and previously frozen right out of the box, which would have been a bigger deal had there actually been detectable quantities of toppings on the slices.  Seriously, I could make out maybe one or two pieces of topping per slice on an extra large pizza.  Pathetic.\n\nI don't feel particularly ripped off because I got this on a $1 lunch Groupon deal, but if I had the opportunity in the future, I wouldn't even drop 100 pennies on this pizza.  When you consider their regular prices (WHICH ARE FREAKING OUTRAGEOUS), this place is a complete bust."
1,"Food was amazing, guacamole was the shit. Cooks get behind. Appetizer came after dinner"
0,"Bland airport Mexican food that doesn't satisfy your Mexi-cravings, but will fill you up.  It seems sort of like Chipotle's crappy little brother.  I got a large (the normal size at Chipotle) burrito with chicken that was unevenly chopped (some pieces were morsels and some could barely fit in my mouth), flavorless rice, pico de gallo, corn, onions, cilantro, lettuce, and a \""little bit of sour cream.\""  In addition to throwing things onto the tortilla as if they were filled with all the hate and scorn of someone who has just missed a flight and been re-booked into a middle seat that doesn't recline, they threw in a huge gob of sour cream.  \n\nThe one thing they have over Chipotle is the option to have cilantro and chopped onions.  How come Chipotle doesn't have that?\n\nSurly service + mediocre (but certainly edible) food + cilantro & chopped onions = 2 stars"

I had issues finding a seamstress that I was happy with before finding Jenny... so mine ended up being rushed.... but she did a completely fabulous job. My appointments with her were fun and relaxed, even with the time crunch!\nShe is a sweet lady with tons of experience under her belt. She has turned the side of her house into her little business :)\nI would recommend her to any and everybody. Her prices are reasonable and fairly average. She's worth the money :)"
0,"Let Hakkasan be a prime example of how NOT to design a night club in Interior Design College classes across the world. They are so lucky the promoters are grabbing the best DJ's in the world to play here or else no one would even think to come here again!\n\nHow much does this place suck? Let me list the ways:\n\n1) Too many stairs. Stairs to get into the club. Stairs to get to the bar. Stairs to get into the other room. Stairs to the bathroom. Are you serious? Make your club on a ground floor with minimal to no stairs. I got the wind knocked right out of me trying to get into the main room. It's just a bad way to start the beginning of your evening breaking a sweat trying to get into a club.\n\n2) Bottlenecked hallways and pathways. Can someone say fire hazard? I love clubs and understand that packed areas are part of the normal protocol. But Hakkasan will test your level of patience with how cramped it gets going from one area to another. And it's not even because of the club not being able to accommodate the crowd they are letting in. It's just a bad lay out and design of their hallways and how people need to get where they want to be.\n\n3) The Dance Floor or lack thereof. This club is huge and you're designating about 1/20th of the venue to the dance floor. It just makes no sense! Especially when you have the hottest dj's in the world playing, everybody wants to be on the dance floor. Well too bad, there's too many people here and too little dance floor to accommodate everyone. So why don't you just stay cramped in a hallway or stairway somewhere cause that's what there is a lot of.\n\n4) You can't see the DJ. For whatever reason, it is impossible to see the DJ here. Once again poor design and layout of the club. The designers just did not take this into consideration when building the venue. Being able to see the DJ is an important part of the experience. Trying to get a view of the DJ is just something a person should not have to worry about. Totally kills the mood.\n\n5) Poor design aesthetics and feel. Upside down parasol umbrellas are hanging from the ceiling, blocking off lighting from the light system that should be hitting the dance floor. They just had no common sense at all installing that fixture. Bartenders and bus boys wearing ninja suits, servers wearing shanghai dresses? It's just tacky and borderline racist.\n\nCalvin Harris, Dada Life, Nervo, and Hardwell are some of my favorite Dj's and I will be waiting for their residencies to end than rather come back to this club. Not even worth to check out for a first time. Seriously! Save your money and time and go to XS, Surrender, Light, or Marquee instead."
0,"Since Pottery Barn Kids sells quality items, I wish I could recommend this store but I must warn you to stay away from it. \n\nOur experience there has been a nightmare.   I ordered furniture from this store in the Chandler Mall to be delivered to my home. A month later, when the items were due, nothing showed up. A month after that, after spending hours and hours on the phone with different customer service agents, I decided to cancel the order since I had nothing to show for it. Next thing I know my credit card is charged for the entire order... AFTER I cancelled it. A week later, no one from Pottery Barn Kids could remove the charge and I had to dispute it at my credit card company. Something I never imagined having to do, especially from a reputable brick and mortar store like Pottery Barn Kids.  Previously, I had ordered all other baby furniture items through potterybarnkids.com online and had no problems.\n\ntl;dr: They didn't give me merchandise I purchased and I had to dispute charge at bank."

1,"First all I need to say is WOW!!!!!!!! \n\nI read the reviews on YELP and they were right on the money. I had my gel nails removed and had white tips put on. My nail technician was \""dad\"". He is sooooo sweet , we hit it off right away. We laughed and his service was IMPECCABLE.  I LOVE MY NAILS .....He offered me green tea (which was the BEST  I have ever had) . We talked about Vietnam,  our mothers etc. \n\nWhen I asked to have my nails done in an oval, Tiffany (daughter ) took over. That woman knows her stuff!!!!!! She takes her time and is such a pleasure to chat with . While I was talking with her I decided to have my toe nails polished changed to the color she had on her fingers. She said \""of course no problem\"".\"" Dad\"" took care of me while she assisted another client. He even very gently took care of my ingrown toenail, which he did not have too since all I was getting was a polish change. He then asked if I wanted a design and I got \""Mom\""..........BEAUTIFUL JOB!!!!!!\n\nWell since i was able to experience the \""WHOLE FAMILY\"" today , I know I will be back and am confident that I will NEVER be disappointed. YEAH!!! I have found my new nail salon .............I walked out of there for only &36..........FULL SET WHITE TIPS and polish change ......................see you guys in two weeks Marvel Nails.............You guys are MARVELOUS :)"

Mexican food, oh yeah, some very good places mostly but Asian, youre better off staying at home and cooking. \n\nWe ordered the Asian Chicken Salad, chicken was old and had that old gross fridge taste.. Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers. \n\nWith Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?"

You'll be able to get all kinds of cheese from Quebec or from elsewhere.\n\nThey really take the time to help you find what suit the best your needs or tastes: if you don't know a cheese, they will cut a little piece for you so you can taste it. If you go there quite often, like I do, they will remember your tastes, I know, it's awesome.\n\nLast, but not least, if you go on a Sunday morning, you'll be able to get some delicious freshly baked Belgian waffles!\n\nA place to know in Verdun..."
0,"I didn't plan on coming here but I needed to eat something quick since I was already at the Aria. Don't wanna drink on an empty stomach, yannoe? \nThis place is way too big to be considered as a cafe. It's a pretty high end cafe. Too big, Too overwhelming and it was pretty dead on a Saturday evening. Service was pretty slow, but the staff is very friendly. So, I'll give them that one. \nI ordered the Rigatoni Pasta. Wasn't worth $20. Tasted like.. Chef Boyardee or something. They gave out complimentary breads.. cold and a little stale? Oh well, they are complimentary for a reason I guess but I do like a good bread to munch on. Wouldn't come back here again."
0,Nevada really needs to work on their plan for funding of PPP in states where there is no state tax. They wanted a 50 dollar deposit for an initial evaluation and 25 dollars for birth control! Those prices are crazy and I have no clue how those who have very little get help from this.
1,So me and the GF bought the vacation package for 1k last year to see if we really wanted to invest in the timeshare.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and the valets always had our car ready by the time we walked out the front door. I loved that i did not have to walk through a cowded casino and gag on clouds of smoke with ocean's of tacky dressed tourist like other places in LV. That fact that this is place is brand new also added to the delight of staying here. Our bed was always made everyday and our out towels and toiletries were always kept stocked. I also fell in love with the shower. having a microwave and actual kitchenware was awesome.\n\nI was disappointed with the kiddie pool they had on the rooftop but the bar and the hot tub made up for it. According to the construction plans they showed us they are suppose to be building a full size pool on a lower floor once the 2ND tower goes up. \n\nSpeak of the 2ND tower and this is also another reason i took away the 5Th star is that construction started really early. I was woken up a couple of times around 6-7am by the noise coming from the rising of the 2ND tower.\n\ni did not mind walking 1/2 of a black to be on a the strip especially when u can cut through the shops @ Planet Hollywood (Aladdin). If it wasn't for me spending so much money already on that trip I probably would have bought the timeshare. we actually split our 1 week into 2 trips so perhaps next time we visit the things i disliked will be different.
0,"Lived here for 2 years. Everything was ok for the most part, until we were getting ready to move out. The water heater in the apartment above us broke, and was leaking water into our laundry room. It took them 3 weeks to getting around to fix it- by that time, the damage was so bad they had to pull out almost all the drywall, and the studs inside had molded. \nThen, we had the carpet cleaned (900 sq ft apartment), and were told it wasn't good enough, so we had the company we used come back and do it again. Management still wasn't satisfied, and we were told that they would have the carpets cleaned and it would come out of our deposit. We were also told we would be charged a small cleaning fee, which would also come out of our $300 deposit. We said fine, dropped off the keys, made sure they had BOTH sets of forwarding addresses, and left- this was august 28th, 2013. \n\nToday, Nov. 14, 2013, I got a call from a bill collector stating that Rancho viejo had turned over a bill for $94 in cleaning fees. NO ATTEMPT was ever made by rancho viejo to contact myself, my husband, or our roommate about this. RV had 3 phone numbers, 3 email addresses, and 2 physical addresses, but made no attempt to contact us about the problem. Worst apartment complex ever.\n\nBottom line: be very careful and document everything when you move out, or they will try to screw you over."
1,"OMG OMG SO AMAZING!!!\n\nFirst off, we had the perfect seats - just four rows back and in the dead center. So visually I think the show was even more stunning than usual. \n\nWe got huge drinks from the super friendly bartender, obviously a bit pricey (theater food, right?)\n\nSuper fun though. I really don't have sufficient words to express how enjoyable this show was. Especially being royally trashed through its entirety."
1,"My father and I always come here to get any of our watches fixed and to put new batteries when they need to be replaced. \n\nI honestly haven't had any bad service here. I had a metal band repaired on my delicate watch that was broken off and was missing a tiny rod to link it together. It took them a few days to fix and now it's like brand new all over again.\n\nI stopped by today to replace batteries for three of my watches, since I only use them when I need to and it's that \""time\"" again haha get it?!?! :) Eh ok anyways... my comedian days have retired.. back to the review.\n\nIt took only a few minutes and they put each watch in a plastic zip lock pouch. Each battery replacement cost $10.75, he says it should be replaced every year and a half, but it should be good for up to 5 years. My watches only go as long as just over a year. \n\nThe service is always prompt and friendly. They are always very helpful with any questions you may have. I'm surprised with the low rating on this place, because I haven't ever received that kind of treatment nor my Father from being loyal customers for many years now.\n\nThere are times where it can be very busy and other times maybe only two people and yourself... but every time I come in here and wait... there's always someone else that's been a regular of this place for many years too.\n\nIt's located right on the corner of Valley View and Spring Mtn. Rd., right by Kung Fu Thai and Chinese Restaurant. If you miss the entry to get in... you can go in the alley after it and just go around again. \n\nHope this helps anybody in need of getting their watch repaired or batteries replaced."

Every time I drive by a panda express I think to myself, \""I haven't been there in a while it might be good\"", and every time, I leave feeling a little sick to my stomach and a little regretful. I'd much rather go next door to Rubios and get some fish tacos or a burrito."
0,"If you like bad service and just OK sushi, then come here. If you don't take my word for it, the empty seats when you walk in \""should\"" be the tall tale sign not to come here.\n\nWe came to this place because all other all-you-can eat sushi joints in the area were  at least 1-2 hour wait(new years weekend). This place had NO wait (I wonder why?).\n\nEach time we ordered something (remember all you can eat) the waitress would ask, \""are you sure??\"". They also had that disgusted look when we ordered. We did not feel welcome at all.\n\nTrust me on this review...\n\nFYI: the food was ok...nothing special. To be honest, all the rolls tastes exactly the same."
1,I had just went there for my puppies third vaccine after my unhappy visit with my past vet. They made an appointment for me on the same day I called and was very swift to get the vaccine done. I can see why this place has a 5 star rating.
1,"This is now my go-to place in Vegas.  Excellent service, beautiful location, very fast elevators, high water pressure, reasonable room rates.  We had a one room suite with a huge bathroom, big garden tub in the bedroom, small kitchen, dining room area and living room area.  Tons of activities, good looking gym.  We had drinks and snacks at the 5th floor pool (bigger than the roof top pool).  No restaurant, no room service, but you are literally only one block from the strip so all that is right outside the door.  The valets even remembered our last name after a day or two there.  Excellent!"
0,If we could hook up television to a small cup and a wire it would be better this truly maddening service. The UI is basically straight out of 1996. The overpriced channels packages give you absolutely nothing OnDemand. Missed a show last night? Too bad.\n\nWanted to DVR the show? Well you better hope it's the only thing you care about since you can only record a single show at a time. We are paying about 80 dollars more per month than the X1 platform by Comcast back in New England. I never thought I would say this but I may have to pick up reading.\n\nGo to a library. Skip this truly backwoods service.
0,"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!! My husband & I bought a Groupon & headed over. We were excited cause we saw a GREAT special online for a burger & a shake for $9.99. As newlyweds on a tight budget..this looked like a GREAT plan. WRONG!!!! Fi should have figured out what we were in for when we pulled up to the parking lot & it was EMPTY on a Sat. Night! Now I COULD make this review soooooo much longer by going into ALL the details, but instead I will give you the highlights(I mean LOW lights!). Menus-STICKY & GREESY. Host & waitress were upset by my discussing the $9.99 burger/shake deal. \""No, we don't have that avail...but EVERYONE ASKS ABOUT THAT !\"" Why? Cause it was on the online menu! I suggested it be removed..I think this was my 1st mistake! Sorry..short really isn't my style..I should have warned you 1st! Ok, besides the dirty menus, the floor was dirty, tables not bussed, etc.. & there was only ONE other table in their besides is! Food quantity was very generous..milk shake was great. HOWEVER...I am sooo sick(MAJOR TUMMY TROUBLES!!! Ever since we got home , & that was 6 HRS AGO!!!!!!!!!! This is really my FIRST REVIEW... But I cannot feel THE CRAPPY, & not tell the world( or at least the Yelp community! never, Never, NEVER come into this 5 & Diner!!!! Unless you don't order anything,  & are only in it for the cute photo pics ONLY...You will seriously REGRET IT...over, & Over, & OVER AGAIN! Stay Away if you want anything edible..seriously...STAY FAR, FAR AWAY!!!!!     PS- the ONLY reason I have it 1 Star is I couldn't post this review w/out one. If I could, this place REALLY needed NEGATIVE stars!!!! ;{"
1,"I dont usually like buffets, but this is pretty darn good.  Mini dishes served instead of just individual food items.  DEF will be back to Las vegas just for this buffet."
0,"I was SOOOO disappointed and also sad we spent $150 a ticket on this.  Here is the problem - I saw LOVE first - and I have seen it 9 times already - that is how good it is.  I would not see this again, ever, unless it changes.\n\nI really am trying to be fair, but it really made me sad that it wasn't equal or better than LOVE.  I know the performers have probably worked really hard but:\n\n1 - the dancing was not in sync a lot of the time\n\n2 - the funny parts were not funny\n\n3 - get rid of the singers! They were great singers, BUT again coming from the LOVE experience where they use all the real Beatles music I wanted to hear more Elvis!\n\n4 - the movies of Elvis were cool, but if you are a fan you have seen them before - too many maybe\n\n5 - the Superhero thing has to go....\n\n6 - the two Elvises on the guitar kept messing up - they had no \""real\"" routine that I could tell and it did not fit the music\n\nI know, I know someone out there is thinking I am not being fair probably - but if you are going to spend money on a Vegas show....see LOVE or KA."
1,"I love this place.  The staff are very friendly and on the ball.  The food is the best for Korean I have had in the metro Phoenix area, and I have eaten at just about all the Korean restaurants.  The owner Richard is really nice, and makes an effort to remember you by name, and even what you had to eat last time.  As for the cost, I wouldn't say it's anymore expensive then any other Korean joint.  Oh and did I forget to mention they have really good sushi as well.  If you like Korean and sushi, this is the place to go."
1,"Fun, chic bar designed by the same folks who did Lotus in New York. It has that upscale, big city vibe - complete w/a velvet rope out front and big men in all black. Located in the Venetian (hence the V), it's a fun place to party but the crowd changes depending on what convention is in town."
0,"Could this place be anymore crowded? I can't get down the aisles, due to crowding of staff, other customers running into me. One gigantic cluster fudge. I did end up buying Kale for my greek tortoise but that is everywhere so I won't be returning. Even then there is no order to checking out. Everyone just cuts in front of you and my God I couldn't get out of there fast enough."
0,This place is now -Rick's Caberet-and it always looks dead probably since its a very hard to get to location.
1,If you want hawaiian and korean food!!! This is the place... The owners treat you like family!!!
1,"Took the parents out to dinner and this was opened on the Monday that we were there at CA Hotel.  Ordered the Rib-eye medium rare and baked potato.  Everything was delicious, but dessert...I know!  I ordered the Creme Brulee.  The custard was too thick, it wasn't creamy and the caramelized sugar on top was greasy.  No bueno."
1,Green chile burger was delicious at lunch.  The appetizer was very good as well.  Service was good. We had no complaints.
0,If you are reading this to decide whether or not you want to go to eat here....I would definitely NOT recommend it....I just bought a bento box and I found a HAIR in my food...I brought this to the attention of the OWNER and he brushed me off....he said he could make me a new box....Now tell me why I would want another box of HAIR covered tempura.....I obviously declined that ridiculous offer and demanded my money back....HE LAUGHED IN MY FACE....saying that it was not possible......So if you are looking for a good sushi place DO NOT enter this establishment....You should instead go to Kaizen sushi because it has great service and does not serve HAIR COVERED FOOD.... If i could I would give them a negative five rating.....
0,"I USED to enjoy going to Tao. The bouncers are great, the music is alright, the atmosphere is beautiful HOWEVER the bartenders need to get their attitudes checked!  Unfortunately, it was not one particular bartender but several at various bars throughout the club.  On one night it was a male bartender who ignored my girls and I.  He opted to suck face with a girl who came to visit him, and when we asked for a drink, he gave us a dirty look instead.  On another occasion a female bartender on the main bar near the main dance floor gave my boyfriend and I attitude because we asked POLITELY for our drinks to be re-made.  Uh, maybe she wouldn't have had to do that if she listened to the complete order. She asked what we wanted to drink then was walking away 1/2 way through our drink order...no wonder she kept getting them wrong!  With my boyfriend and I in the industry, we understand things can get hectic and did not jump the gun & remained calm- maybe she's having a bad night?  Please explain why she walks up to us, slams the drinks on the counter and asks the gentleman standing next to us if he knows my boyfriend and to tell him that she thought he was a \""F'n jerk.\""  ahahahahaha!  What a Bit@h right?  We still tipped her, but never returned to Tao again.  We will NEVER recommend Tao to anyone who sits at our bar and inquires about clubs in Las Vegas."
0,"I was in town for a convention last week and a friend of mine, who is a local, suggested we meet at this place.  He said the food was really good.  The food was pretty expensive and only average. Imagine Olive Garden at the double the price.  My spaghetti and meatballs were $28 I think and I didn't even want to finish it all.  The worst part was the VERY overpriced wine list.  I am an experienced wine drinker as I travel and collect wines.  The list was not very creative and most bottles I recognized had a 3x markup.  After carefully reviewing the wine list, I decided to order a beer as I have a hard time paying such marked up prices.  My buddy commented he will also not return.  I will say our server was very good though."
0,I bought two pints of this from whole foods today and I just read the ingredients list. They use corn syrup in their products!!!! This is a disgrace.  I can't believe Whole Foods sells your products.  I will never buy this again.  Why wouldn't you use cane sugar?  I am throwing this away and telling whole foods to stop selling your product.
0,"I was really looking forward to trying out Baku! As a foodie and a sushi lover, I have not been able to find any sushi place that has \""wowed\"" me in Charlotte. Everything is always just OK & that is exactly how it was at Baku. Add in slow & inexperienced service and the fact that it is overpriced = we will not be going back. Being in the food industry myself, I know how hard it is to get a restaurant flowing nicely with no kinks, so some of this may be due to the fact that it is fairly new, and I do hope that they will improve. I called to make a reservation last Saturday and the man who answered said that 9:30 would be fine. When we got there, I was honestly surprised at how full the restaurant was! I walked up to the hostess and she told me that there was no reservation in my name. She said they would try to seat us as soon as possible, which they did (about 10 min). I do appreciate the decor and think that it would be a cute place to grab a drink and some light appetizers, but please do not spend your hard earned money on this overpriced food. It honestly hurt my heart to sign my bill because we hated our food so much. I was really excited about the shishito peppers because I love them and they are really hard to find in Charlotte - they came topped with this weird shaving, but they were still good. I also ordered the grilled artichokes and the sashimi platter - both BLAH. My sister is the one that had real problems with her food. She ordered the beef and asparagus skewers and a mushroom roll. The beef skewers came out rare - it is extremely unprofessional to not ask how someone would like their meat cooked. Not everyone likes rare. When we asked if they could cook it longer, she said that the chef is weird about stuff like that, so she would let us know. She reluctantly took it back and it cooked to about a medium rare not a medium like my sister asked. The mushroom roll took one hour and 15 minutes to arrive at our table. It was close to 11:30 by the time we got it. I don't really understand why it took that long & the waitress kept telling us different things about it. I would have liked to have seen that item comped or at least have the manager come to the table to apologize - nope! It would even be a little bit better if the roll was actually good, which it wasn't. I really hope that the staff and management work on fixing these issues because I really cannot see an overpriced sushi restaurant that isn't even good surviving during these times."
0,"I had high hopes after reading plenty of positive reviews on yelp. Not to mention being out of town, I wanted to go to place the locals went to and not just some chain restaurant.\n\nWe drove an extra 25 minutes to get to Daily Dose from our hotel. I was actually excited to try the breakfast.  My two breakfast weakness are eggs Benedict and Belgium waffles and it is always a challenge for me to choose one or the other.\n\n At Daily Dose, I decided to try their  \""Strawberry Creme Brule\"" Belgium waffle which sounded great from the description. It was going to be topped with fresh strawberries, vanilla bean cr\u00e8me brule & whipped cream. You also had to option with a choice of fresh fruit, cottage cheese or DD hash. I opted for the DD hash.\n\nWhen the dish came out it looked quite nice as you can tell from the photo.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HCCg-rVnHQ2FI6lHs_LvUQ?select=gkkpOGnT5GmRuNBYx15zXA\n\nHowever, eating it was another thing.  The whipped cream was fine, and the creme brule sauce was very sweet which substituted having to use regular maple syrup.  My issue with this Belgium waffle was the texture. As you cut through the waffle, it was like cutting through a very dense cake and it ended like a rock in my stomach for the next few hours. (no bueno) Most of the Belgium waffles I've had elsewhere are light and crispy.\n\nI thought, \""Oh, maybe it was just my Belgium Waffle that was dense and cake like.\"" However, my friend who ordered the blueberry version of the Belgium Waffle had the same complaint. He too never had such a dense cakey waffle before. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HCCg-rVnHQ2FI6lHs_LvUQ?select=XtVob_W2GT-ogi_csDEiLg\n\nThe DD hash ended up to be a sauteed squash which which was both sweet and savory, I think it is definitely and acquired taste. \n\nThe service was decent. Our coffee cups were never half empty. \n\nThere are both indoor and outdoor seating in the patio.\n\nPerhaps it was a bad day to order Belgium waffle at DD, but sadly it left me feeling disappointed after being so excited to try this place out."
1,"The best customer service. I had some issues with a special order and Kim the manager took special care and solved my problem. Employees are always friendly. I've been to other locations, but this is one of the best."
1,"Great find that my Fiance and I stumbled on to when we were exploring the Bellagio after checking in.  \n\nWe ordered a berry crepe and tiramisu.  Ordinarily I would not get Tiramisu, I hate it, it's on the bottom of the barrel of my dessert list, but my Fiance loves the stuff and their tiramisu actually looked fantastic ... and it was!!  Easily the best tiramisu that I have ever had .. which ultimately will make me hate any other tiramisu desserts not from here even more... oh well.  The crepe was okay .. nothing special."
1,"This might be the best show in Vegas! I've seen a lot of shows here, and a lot of Cirque shows. This show has it all! \nIt's set in a very intimate tent outside of Caesars Palace. From what it seems, all seats are good seats! We sat in row F and never had trouble seeing what was going on. All the acts are amazing in their own way and I found myself gasping slack jawed several times. Ladies are absolutely gorgeous and talented! \nIt's raunchy and hilarious and full of sexual jokes and foul language. I loved it! Go see it! I would highly recommend this to anyone, as long as you aren't a prude!"
1,This food was incredible. Cute owners and very attentive to needy people like me.
0,"This is American chain style Mexican. I've been ruined by legit Mexican restaurants.  The salsa's were good but so hot that you cannot keep eating them. You can have too much heat. Flautas were dry, have had better frozen from the grocery store. Carne Adovada burrito was pork and I think some seasoning. I used the red salsa in an attempt to save it. Filibertos Adovada is much better. Garlic shrimp. How can you mess it up. I'm not sure if i even tasted garlic. Shrimp is not their specialty. Red Chili burrito did have a lot of sauce, better than the Adovada but not worth the $8.50."
0,"Their famous dry-aged steak was decent, as in kinda good, nothing more. The meat portions are huge so that made up for it's price of $45ish. \n\nThe lobster tail was quite dry and lacked a lot more natural flavor than it should've and the reddish seasoning on top didn't help at all.  It cost me 75 bucks alone!! Yes, it was a big lobster tail, but it sucked.  In hindsight, I should've said that it sucked to see if my server would remove it from our check.  However, he didn't ask how the food was, and I felt generous that night or something. \n\nThe mac and cheese side dish was bland as hell. Chef Boyardee could put out a better dish, which is really, really saying something.  \n\nThe best part was the green beans which were very well seasoned and very tasty but way overpriced for what they were.  The portion was modest at best but cost us something in the teens.\n\nI must admit that if it wasn't for their lavish display of the process of dry-aging steaks in the glass enclosure right outside their restaurant, I wouldn't have felt tempted to eat there."
0,"We went in on a Friday afternoon about 3:00 and sat at the bar.  Having a Groupon but reading the reviews here, we had very low expectations.  Place was quiet and we saw no dancing, etc.   \n\nHonestly, I felt CnC's wasn't as bad as what was written, but we only had one drink each and a plate of chicken nachos to the tune of $40. CnC's wouldn't allow us the two-for-one price at happy hour, and the nachos were large but very expensive for what you get.  Chips were drowned in the cheap cheese sauce and upset both our stomachs.  Meat was questionable and there was nothing but chips, cheese, and chicken.  Yes, the reviews about lacking flavor are accurate.  We got a tiny little plastic cup of jalepenos and another of diced tomatoes.  Bartender never came back to ask how everything was or if we needed anything, despite walking right by us dozens of times!  In her defense, she did take the $3 that our bill went over the Groupon price off our tab.\n\nWould we go back?  Definitely not, but we kind of knew that going in after reading all these reviews, but we were already stuck with the Groupon and hoping for better.  We'd bought the Groupon thinking we'd get the giant margaritas and souvineer CnC glasses, then learned there was a liner inside the glasses that halfed the ounces of beverage. No longer much of a deal, and then told not allowed at happy hour.  I'd be surprized if this place survives for another year unless they lower their prices and up the food quality.  No free chips and salsa in a Mexican restaurant (and very expensive Mexican restaurant at that) is just not right!!"
1,"I'd give this place five stars except I consider it pricey and the limited weekend hours can inflate the bill a little.  Very pleasant staff who remembered my pet from one visit to the next.  Clean, clean, clean.  Deluxe accomodations and I like the touch of the little photo of my dog playing placed on my bill. \n\nAlso, they are very attentive to making sure your pet's shots are up-to-date.  So that gives confidence that only healthy animals are boarded - or at least it reduces the chance that your pet will come home with something they picked up while boarded.\n\nI have used off-and-on for two years now.  Sometimes they are booked solid and I have to go elsewhere, and I haven't found anywhere else that compares quality-wise.  I feel very guilty boarding my sweet Lab at all.  Going here reduces that feeling as much as possible.\n\nHighly recommended for your puppy dog."
1,"I had a broken hinge on my garage door and called in my home warranty.  I was VERY worried when I saw all of the negative reviews on here, but if it was home warranty with these guys or me on my own, I'd give it a shot.\n\nI called that morning, and got a same day fix.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they asked if I would be home all morning, and then the guy didn't show up until about 1 (and didn't call first, so I'm glad I stuck around!)\n\nBut he also greased all of my hinges and rollers for me with no charge, so I was pretty happy overall.  I'm sure the other negative reviews really did happen on here and that sucks, but I just wanted to write a review to let you know if you get these guys with your home warranty, it might actually turn out ok!"
0,"Food was alright but the service was not that good and they were out of a lot of stuff at the bar. they were out of cranberry juice when my bf and i went in at 7 pm. Asked for no cheese on the pasta and got cheese on top then the owners wife, who was waiting on us, proceeded to say that it's an Italian restaurant and all Italian sauce has cheese."
0,"07/17/14 On Trac has repeatedly given us poor service. Our vendor uses them to ship orders to us at our business. This week, we were told they didn't deliver because our business was closed at 4:30pm. Our shipping and receiving is open until 5pm. When I questioned the driver the next day he lied to my face. We complained to his corporate office. Yesterday, they attempted delivery at 6pm knowing we were closed. It's 3:15 pm, the following day and still no delivery. They must have the worst drivers and the lowest cost delivery service.\n\nI would not use them if you wish to have happy customers.\n\n07/18 Update. Ontrac now reports on their website they attempted to deliver the package at 7:00pm last night. Really? 7:00pm. If we were closed at 4:30 one night, 6:00pm the next, 7:00 is the direction to go?"
0,"Quick Summary: Savers sucks. \n\nI don't understand why people like this place. It's very overpriced. I've been in and out of this location several times and even with a family group who loves to go thrift store shopping we've maybe found $20 worth of stuff to buy in here. And 1/4 of that was two aluminum water bottles I found. \n\nCustomer service? I'm laughing at myself for even mentioning it. Hey, at least they have plenty of parking! And you can always walk over to Colleen's consignment shop a couple of doors down to make the most of your trip here. \n\nOtherwise looking for another thrift store somewhere else might be a good idea."
1,"MacMedia is simply the best! I purchase all of my apple products from them as they have the best customer service with knowledgable and helpful employees. Their laser etchings are truly works of art! Go to MacMedia, you won't be disappointed!"
1,I had a great experience here at Island Auto. I came here because of the great reviews on Yelp and was not disappointed.  I had my radiator changed in two different cars and have referred friends and family and they all are very happy with Mr. Kuba's services.  He really is an honest mechanic.  He doesn't overcharge. His prices are reasonable.  If you come to Island Auto for your car needs I guarantee you will be happy with his services.
1,"I fell in love with this place a few weeks ago when my friend and I decided to try it on a whim. (By friend, I mean fellow foodie).  I love that Los Reyes isn't your typical Mexican place.  Not that I don't love that food, but this place is a cut above.  \n\nMy friend and I tried the cheese quesadilla del rey which was my first quesadilla made with corn tortillas and green sauce.  Muy delicioso! We also shared the Cubano torta which was very tasty.  I loved the cantaloupe juice I ordered, but I could see how many might not.  If you're not a real cantaloupe fan, it's a bit much.  \nThe next time I went with a different friend, we ordered the del rey torta which was HUGE!  We couldn't even eat half of it.  I know they are known for this torta, but the combination of meats was a bit much for me.  I preferred the Cubano.  We also ordered the Huarache with carne asada and it was very good.  I would order it again.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try some more of their fruit delicacies and maybe a platillo or some tacos.  This place seems one-of-a-kind.  The servers were super nice and friendly, even though both times we were the only gringos in the place and had to point to the menu.  I will make this place a regular stop.\n\nMrs. Siegel"
1,"OK this place has been on diners drive-ins and dives and I have been here a handful of times. It is the one place where when you are talking about going out and grabbing food that everyone forgets, however when you remember it everyone always says HECK YEAH!!\n\nChino Bandido is Chinese Mexican fusion (yeah I know at first it sounds NASTY) but they really make it work.\n\nWhen you go in immediately to your right you will see order forms. Now I will be honest the first time, and the second time I went in I wondered how I was supposed to fill it out. It appeared that I would need to use college level algebra. However if you ask the staff they will explain it and it actually is really easy.\n\nMy favorite is the combination of Jade Red Chicken and Teriyaki Chicken, with Jerk Fried Rice and Refried Beans.\n\nWarning the Jerk Chicken is HOT (now I can hear my friend Chris in the background calling me a weenie, however be warned.) With each dish they have cookies either a snickerdoodle which is awesome but their volcano cookies are DELICIOUS. You get a chocolate cookie you put a warm gooey center and top with powdered sugar.\n\nAll in all one of my favorite places in the Valley to eat in or bring home."
0,"I used this company just over 3 years ago and had no issues. So when it was time to move into my new house a few days ago 8 didn't hesitate to book with them. \nI called and scheduled my appointment on Monday oct29 for that Friday at 0830. All of my information was taken down and it was set.\nFriday 0845 and nobody is there... so I called and Mark (who may be the owner) sounds completely dumbfounded and says he has nothing scheduled for me and that he will call me back. \nLong story short, I had no movers and they were scrambling to put a 2 man crew together to get to me at some point. My day is now shot, afternoon appointments now have to be rescheduled,  it was a mess. They finally arrived at 1300 and took until about 1745. I was discounted a whole $10/hour for the trouble. \nI'm being nice here but in general I was extremely irritated and I will no longer use or recommend this company to anyone in the future. \nThe 2 stars are mainly for my first encounter a few years ago. They would get a 1 now, if that."
1,"Updated: June 15th 2008\n - Finally stayed at Red Rock for the weekend. I have to say, I like it a lot. Super comfy beds, really smooth styling of the rooms and overall hotel interior. Nice pools and accommodations. I still think the slots are fun. And the food court really is a nice thing to have when you're craving an ice cold Coke and fries at 2am.\n - The Spa: I had the aromatherapy massage with Suki and she's a great therapist. Everything she did helped to ease the tension in my body and release the night before's fatigue and sludge. I liked the amenities, especially the spa guest-only pool. Next time, I'll have to get there earlier and enjoy those features longer.\n\nOriginal review (7.9.2007):\nHotels are moving away from the strip, and I like it. The Red Rock casino was good to look at. Packed this past weekend, with a good mix of crowds. Slots weren't paying but we still had a good time. The pool looked awesome, but wasn't staying there, but hope to, but rates are a bit steep, but sometimes, you just gotta splurge and do it. Do it."
0,"I waited a while to write my review because I wanted to be sure I wasn't writing it out of pure anger. After my experience I would never use this company again and do not recommend that anyone else does. \n\nI purchased the deal through yelp and was scheduled right away actually for the next day. The woman who showed up to clean my home was on time and was very friendly. She got through my kitchen, master bedroom and master bathroom. She did not clean anything else but what she did get through was very thorough. Th problem is that she used oven cleaner on the top of my stove- ruining the control panel. The company offered the replace the piece however it has been discontinued so 3 weeks later I ended up settling for a scratched part from eBay. (That was my choice and actually the only choice). Someone from Moxie dropped off the part at my home and I ended up having to pay someone to install it. \n\nWorst part- they ended up charging me more than the quoted price! The house cleaner didn't even get through half of what I was quoted for. They did end up refunding me the extra charge however I still paid $95 for the yelp deal and another $50 for the stove part replacement. What a waste. Hiring someone is supposed to be a stress reducer not stressor."

0,"I only came to try out the casino and restaurant, I didn't stay at the hotel so I can't rally review that part. \n\nThe casino is pretty small and the games offered are all the regulars. There aren't as many table games as other casinos. \n\nThe restaurant was suuper busy and the wait was really long, so we ended up eating at the sports bar, where they served the same food as in the restaurant. The fooood took forever to come out. We were practically ready to leave. And then when we finally got our wings, they weren't even that great. Uhh, and I hate how Hooters charges you extra for sauce. Everyone eats wings with sauce!"
1,"I came to Meadows Mall particularly to go to Spencers to find a Christmas gift for my oldest dearest friend. I remember seeing a Edward Cullen snuggie here months  ago (she would have loved it!) so I was hoping they would still have it. Unfortunately they didn't have it but they had the next best thing an Edward Cullen Blanket. I asked for a gift box but the cashier said they only had a gift bag but it wouldn't be appropriate. I asked why and he whispered  \""It says here's your (fbomb) Birthday gift\"". I was like oh okay. \n\nI love Spencers because they have off the wall gifts!"
0,"I had huge expectations for this place based on the celeb chef.  We only ate lunch and perhaps the dinner menu has better offerings.  Service was good and knowledgeable.  We had the fish and chips and lobster rolls.  Lobster rolls were good but not phenomenal.  Fish and chips, the fish was not crisp and crunchy but the fries were awesome.  In fact, the chips with the lobster roll were delicious too.  So sadly, at a seafood restaurant, our fave things were the potatoes!"
0,"If you think this is an authentic Philly Cheese Steak, you have clearly never been to the city of brotherly love. The one star is for the bun, it actually was pretty good. All down hill from there.The \""steak\"" which seemed to be just as quality as a SteakUm you would get in the frozen section at the grocery store, was greasy and lacked any kind of seasoning! The only flavor was from the onions. Definately not returning, not worth another try...: ("
1,"I held off on reveiwing this place because the first time I went, they had just opened and it was a little shaky, but I thought, \""Hmmm, this is going to turn into something special.  Give it time.\""  And guess what?  It happened!  \n\nFirst of all, can we give a BIG UPS to the two sisters opening this joint on their own terms??  The womens studies feminist from my college days applaudes you.  And I love that when you walk into this place, those sisters are wearing some crazy ass midriff tops and high waisted shorts and bright red lipstick.  I really want to be their friend!\n\nOn to the drinks now.  Love me some cool crafted cocktails.  Their \""elixirs\"" here are sometimes really out there, and I've liked some and hated others, but that's the fun about trying new drinks!  \""What's in that?  Honey and serrano pepper bitters?  LAY IT ON ME.\""  One of my favorite bartenders Alex has set up shop down there, too, and he is a kick ass mixologist.  My husband was excited because they are aging some stuff in oak barrels right in the bar.  I don't know much about that stuff, but apparently, that's REALLY COOL.\n\nAnd the fact that this place is named after a beloved children's book makes the third grade teacher in me smile.  Literature and cocktails...not a better mix than that!"
0,Had to run to walmart late night the other night for some cat litter.  Literally every person in the store was either rude or just completely uninterested in helping locate what I needed.  They were doing a remodel which meant that everything was not in it's normal place.  Let's just say I won't be going back to walmart any time soon.
0,"I just gave this exact place in Centennial Center a five star review, cause it's great. I say to go to the Centennial Center instead of the Summerlin area, if you really want to experience this place for what it really is.\n\nNever got a chance to try the food at the Summerlin area actually, the people were too fucking rude for me to want to even put up with their shit long enough to be seated.\nI was with someone, and we were coming back from Red Rock when we stopped here to eat. I figured since the Centennial place was so awesome, I could expect the same thing here.\nWe walk in, there's no seat-yourself sign. So we stand there, looking at all the empty tables, but  the hostess tells us to wait and walks off. Some teeny-bopper with pink hair is at the cashier, and after a few minutes of the hostess not returning I ask here if we could just seat ourselves, like the other location. She gets all annoyed that we DARE bother her and tells us to just wait. After another few minutes of watching the hostess walk back and forth, not really doing anything but ignoring us, we walk out.\nWasn't going to deal with that horse shit, and pretty disappointed that the customer service quality wasn't the same as the other location. They are run by the same people right?\n\nI really don't understand how the people that work here are so rude compared to the Centennial location. Maybe it just reflects the customers that come in, since we all know everyone that lives in Summerlin is an asshat. But there's no need to assume a sour attitude with everyone that walks in.\n\nLuckily we didn't eat here, I've heard that the food isn't as good as the other one either. It pangs me to give this a shitty review cause I really do like the restaurant, I just think this location needs a big hug or something."
0,"Do NOT take your film to this Walgreens for processing.  They recently lost a roll of film that I dropped off there for processing (from a special trip that my wife and I took), and they could not even tell me who was responsible for handling it (I asked them if they had a schedule so they could figure out which staff member to follow-up with and try to locate the film, and they said they did not).  They also said they lost film for another ~7 people.  It's really amazing to me how disorganized they are in their photo department, with no accountability for mistakes (particularly with something as important as their customer's photographs)."
0,"They definitely need to work on their customer service. We came here Friday night & awkwardly stood there for about 3min before someone said can I help you. (Note there was about 5 employees present) We proceeded to place our order w/ a hispanic chubby girl who obviously had a stick up her ass. Then we got our Pizza & wings & she had the nerve to say \""have a good night.\"" Uhhh...we were eating in. We had to ask for our own plates. No one ever asked if we were doing okay, even though we needed forks for our boneless wings. We ate a bit & were super annoyed so we left.\nThe pizza was nothing to rave about. I'd compare it to Little Cesars but more greasy & thinner. Their boneless wings were blah. I will not be coming back or  recommending this place to anyone. \nFYI: I'd recommended Big Boys Pizza for awesome pizza & great customer service."
0,Ok so I've been here 20 minutes. 10 minutes to get someone to seat me. 5 minutes waiting to order. Another 5 minutes since I got my coffee but can't stir in my cream and sugar because no silverware. So far Denny's sucks.
0,"We used to love this place. We would get the nachos, .99 margaritas and split an entree. It's gone downhill so much. The food is now disgusting, service is horrible and the place is filthy. It smells like a toilet. Next time you're in a booth at the bar, look at the corrugated metal."
0,"Als Gesch\u00e4ftsreisender kann ich keine Empfehlung aussprechen.

0,"It was my first time and will be my last visit. I don't know where and how this place got 4.5 stars from yelpers. There were 8 of us dined in tonight. We got separate bill and 20% tip was added to each bill. \n\nMy friends ordered chimichanga, burrito, kimchi fried rice, and pork sliders. I was the only one ordered pan fried fish. I asked if the they deep fried or breaded. The waitress told me they grilled the fish. What? But I'm an adventurous food lover, so I went ahead and gave it a chance anyway. What a disappointment! My dish was the last to came out. The fish fillet was cold, bland, soggy, and felt apart as soon as I touched it with the fork, so I asked for a chopsticks instead. The vegetables, mostly broccoli, with few pieces of onion, and green bell pepper were also tasteless. I couldn't tell if they were grilled or pan fried. Standard Korean sticky rice came with it, nothing special. I barely eaten my food. Most of my friends didn't finish their neither. \n\nI was going to get the Calypso Lemonade, but decided to skip it after how disappointed my food was. \n\nMy advice: spend your money elsewhere. This place doesn't worth the drive up to North Las Vegas."
0,"What a disaster!  The only reason I gave one star was because there were no negative star options!  Definitely not a place to go with a large party.   We had a party of 13 and a reservation for 7:15 to have a celebratory dinner.  We all stood in the lobby waiting for our \""reservation\"" for about 40 minutes. We were the wait was because they didn't have enough menus.  Really??? My bad, thought it was pretty standard to have enough menus for your guest.  It was about 8 pm before we even placed our orders. Every part of this experience was horrible.  Dinner/salads started coming out before the apps.  I never got the drink I ordered, we kept being told refills were coming which never happened.  Some of the dishes were just so awful they were inedible. 2 of our party ordered tri trip which looked like it had just been scavenged somewhere from the kitchen and thrown on the plate. It was so tough they couldn't chew it. I ordered the chicken parm pasta which was nothing like the description.  The breading was soggy and needed to be cooked longer and it was pretty tasteless. I was skeptical about even eating it wondering if I would get sick. The talapia and shrimp dish came out missing it's sauce.  Potatoes came with no toppings and the beef ribs were full of fat and rubbery.  We had to ask repeatedly for things like toppings and drink refills.  By the time they did bring toppings for the potatoes, they had to bring new potatoes because the original ones were cold.  The manager finally came over and started trying to help our waiter play catch up by bringing out drinks.  One couple had to share a glass all through dinner because their drink never came.  Our server was clearly in over his head and freaking out making it a very uncomfortable experience for all of us. His attitude and lip service was like we should share the blame for his misfortune of having to deal with our large party.  When the waiter asked if we would be needing separate checks he was very excited when we said no, one is fine. He then tells us, that's awesome, you guys just don't understand I'm dislexic and this is really difficult!  PRICELESS!  \n\nOur host was very upset because it was his intention to treat us all to a great meal and experience.  Unfortunately CJ has gone way down hill!  Meals used to be incredible and a very special experience.  Not the case this time.  Go somewhere else!!"
1,"I liked it. I was pretty wrecked when I was there, I slightly remember eating a pizza, and listening to a guitar player and a lot of birds. Props to the staff for putting up with our obnoxiousness. I think it has potential to be my favorite bar in Chandler."
1,"Bumping it up a star for the tastings. Now that there's a TW in the same shopping center, I've made the rounds to both for tastings and I like BevMo's because it's always the same guys doing the tastings. TW is great and it's nice to have another option in the area, but I'm now a BevMo girl and prefer the experience over TW.\n\nAlso, can't beat the 5 cent wine sale which is basically year-round and not a limited time as the word \""sale\"" implies."
1,always good - the perfect junk food fix that really tastes good...my guilty pleasure\n\nthe team here is consistently efficient & friendly
1,"I agree with the other reviews, Yasu serves some of the best Japanese food in Phoenix.  The formula of fresh high quality ingredients, authentic preparation, artful presentation, modern yet unpretentious decor, friendly service and reasonable prices is destined for success.\n\nHaving spoiled my taste buds in Tokyo eating sushi every week for 5 months at Tsukiji, the world's biggest fish market, it's been hard to find satisfying sushi, especially in Phoenix.  \n\nI was delighted to see fishes imported from Japan on the menu, like spanish mackerel (aji) which I've seen only at the best sushi restaurants.  We order it as sashimi - the slices were presented next to the bones of the fish (head to tail intact) with ginger and chopped green onions.  The fish was fresh and full of flavor.  \n\nAfter we finished the dish, the waiter took the bones back to be deep-fried.  This is as authentic as it gets - the Japanese waste nothing.  If you can get past your squirmishness of eating fish brains, this is the ultimate crunchy treat.\n\nUnfortunately, ankimo (monkfish liver) - one of my favorite raw dishes - creamy without being fishy served traditionally with ponzu sauce - was out that day.  We had the succulent kumamoto oysters, which were also served with ponzu, instead.\n\nThe grilled yellowtail (hamachi) filet and collar (hamachi kama) were both perfect - grilled patiently over oak charcoals until the exterior was wonderfully crispy while the interior stayed deliciously moist.  I generally prefer hamachi kama because it's oiler and more tender but the presentation of the filet was quite dramatic - long plate with fried root chips on one end and ponzu sauce with grated radish on the other.  \n\nGrilling like this does take time so be prepared to wait 20-30 min for this dish.  Quicker grilled dishes include the giant scallops wrapped in bacon and tasty lamb chops.  We also ordered the beef tongue but somehow the waiter never entered it in.\n\nWe also ordered a childhood favorite: cornflake shrimp - jumbo sized shrimp rolled in cornflakes and deepfried, served with a homemade tartar sauce.\n\nWe loved the variety on the menu and can't wait to go back to try more dishes, esp the ankimo and grilled tongue."
0,"I'm not sure why the reviews are so high. Perhaps it was an off night. We had dinner here last night and if felt like one thing after another. Yes, we were seated right away... at a dirty table. Ok, wiped it off, we're all good. The bread basket is like something from a presliced bag from a grocery store. The caprese starter was good but they really need to take the tomatoes out of the fridge. They were cold, hard, and a bit grainy. The presentation and size was great. We both ordered the Chicken Saltinboca the procuttio was overlooked on my husbands and mine was burnt, the noodles and sauce were very salty. To their credit the food wait time was short. Our service was *terrible*. In the beginning I said to our server I would just like water, when we left my glass was completely empty not even ice in it and had never been refilled. Not that it wasn't requested. When asked about dessert we declined because we just wanted to leave already. I cannot recommend this place to anyone. :("
0,"Ordered the 12 piece La Jolla set in silver and canvas. Received the furniture, looks great in our rooftop terrace. No issues with the delivery BUT the reason why I am giving this company 2 stars is that there was a chair cushion missing from the set delivered. Ok, that is fair enough things can get lost or go missing however when I contacted the company their interest level was down to zero. Pretty much we got your money thank you very much. I contacted the guy to advise we will need a replacement cushion and he was quite defensive we take photos to ensure all pieces are sent blah blah. I said that is fine we can pay for the replacement if need be. The guy asked me then to send him an email detailing the cushion etc which was more than 2 weeks ago and I have heard nothing! So here you go 2 stars for the customer service you will receive!"
1,"Great place to grab lunch on a beautiful day.\n\nI had the French Quarter Salad w/ grilled chicken and it was fantastic. Service was good and the food came relatively fast for a lunch rush. The best part of the experience was eating outside on a beautiful day, when we went inside to pay it was pretty loud."
1,"on my first night in montreal, i passed by dr.frost and noticed a sign for \""macarons givres\"" and was instantly intrigued. i had no idea what \""givres\"" meant though, so i kept walking. eventually i learned that \""macarons givres\"" are macaron ice cream sandwiches and i absolutely had to check them out. i was greeted by giant day-glo colored macarons with a blob of ice cream inside, they looked like some kind weird frankenversion of the cute, delicate macarons i was used to so i held off on trying one til my last day in montreal. \n\nINSTANTLY HOOKED at first bite! the cookie is a little denser than a \""normal\"" macaron but still slightly chewy and crumbly. they really are freak-ish day-glo colors though and are really awkwardly sized and difficult to bite into. still, it kinda fits the \""mad scientist\"" theme of the shop. you can choose from pre-made macaron combos or mix and match your own creation with their ice cream flavors. they have a stone slab style ice cream with mix-ins, as well as frozen yogurt and shakes.\n\ni loved my first sandwich so much that i went back and bought three more only minutes before i had to catch my bus back to boston (and these babies aren't small!) while wheeling my suitcase and trying to balance my frozen macaron sandwiches i dropped one on the street...and for a moment i considered picking it up. they're THAT good!"
0,"2 stars for good food but rude service. My husband and I LOVE sushi, so we always go for all-you-can-eat deals. I found it off-putting that the waitress was hesitant in taking our order form because according to her \""that is so much!\"". Please don't advertise all-you-can-eat if you cant deliver."

1,"When I came back home to Pittsburgh and walked into the Wine Loft, I was thrilled at the decor like many others. Looked like somewhere I would find in LA or DC. I enjoyed that on Mondays they have $5 Martinis, Mojitos and Manhattans and then on Wednesdays they have $5 wine by the glass. I did expect this place to be more expensive being new and in the up and coming location of Southside Galleria, so I was content/happy with the prices.  It's all appetizers, but they are good portions. There were three of us and we got 4 different apps and were all full and satisfied. The pizza is VERY good. We went on a cold Monday night, so it was pretty slow, only one waitress on and she busted her ass because it was a bit too much for one person. Her service was still good and the food and drinks came out really fast. I know someone complained of not having anything available, but they had everything we wanted when we went. I plan to come again with a group of girl friends for my birthday! Hopefully I will still walk out a fan."
0,"I've been sitting waiting for over an hour for my car side assistance through my insurance company . They called and told me an hour then another hour , then 30 minutes and yet they still aren't here ! Horrible company very slow and will ask my insurance company to never send them for me again . If they could get negative stars they would be a -5."
0,"Einstein's Bagels are pretty poor in general, so perhaps its unfair to rate this particular location so lowly, you say? Not so fast...\n\nFound myself killing time between meetings here 2 years ago, and ordered the bagel that made me famous in some out of the way places -- everything bagel, butter, tomato.  That's it. A simple order, provided the tomatoes aren't green, under-ripe and miserable, which they have been at this location often. So I ask, \""hey, I'd like this creepy bagel order I get everytime I'm here, but not if the tomatoes are miserable and white/green. Can you please check, and if they are, please don't serve them to me. Despite how they are universally beloved, I don't particularly like white, veiny, hard tomatoes.\""\n\nShe acknowledged my request, and when I was handed my bagel, I figured it meant that they were ripe. Not only weren't they, they were almost pure white winter tomatoes and sliced extra thick. I mean... really?\n\nThis might seem like a small thing, but I asked, and I was served the exact thing I requested to not be served. I haven't been back since, and I spit twice when I pass it.\n\nI take bagels (way too) seriously..."
0,"Good, but there are better restaurants in the area (for lunch).  It's popular-trendy to go there if you work in the area.  I avoided this place because there were ALWAYS people from my office here!  Their selection is great, but their employees didn't want to go the extra mile AT ALL.  I got a dirty look asking for a side a certain way.  Not very healthy either.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just totally over the whole concept of bread companies."
0,"My group had one appetizer that was pretty good, but everything else was average at best.  None of the sandwiches surpassed \""OK,\"" and overall the place just failed to wow on every front.  Nothing was explicitly bad, but there are better options for lunch or dinner.\n\n(Note: I went for dinner; going for drinks or an event might be a different story.)"
1,"Not much for chain restaurants, but this place delivered a quality burger.  I had the triple prime cheeseburger that was cooked exact to my order, service was attentive and prices are decent."
1,"Dog days has quickly become a favorite place for our dog Meatball. He LOVES it. I can barely keep him from jumping out the window of my car when we are pulling up. \n\nThe owner Megan was great about explaining everything they do there and gave me a tour the first time I stopped in. There are two sections, one for large dogs and one for small dogs. The employees play with the dogs all day and I can be sure that Meatball will come home tired from playing.\n\nThey have a 1/2 day rate ($15) and a full day ($30) rate. It may be a bit pricier than a few other places I looked at, but totally worth it. It's also right by my house, so that makes it that much better.\n\nMeatball is still a puppy so we are still feeding him three times a day. I dropped him off one day and forgot to leave his lunch (bad mommy). When I returned a few hours later to drop it off, they had already fed him! That was AWESOME! \n\nI trust the employees and am completely satisfied with the experience we've had so far.  I feel good about leaving him for our out-of-town trips. We will continue to be a loyal customer. Thanks Dog Days!"
0,"I see this place has closed. They always had a sign out that read \""Opened for Breakfast\"". But they were never opened for breakfast. I ate there once and had a burger and fries and did not go there again since the food wasn't the greatest."
1,"Hands-down the best Thai food in town. You haven't had pad Thai until you've tried it here. Always quality food and at a very reasonable price. It seems like the owners are always here making everyone feel welcome. I am really looking forward to trying their new place in Ocotillo. Oh, and the cantaloupe martini is a must."
0,"CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.... NOT SERVED ON WEEKDAYS!! I'll just get that one out of the way, right away. Being a nice French restaurant located right on the edge of one of the Venetian's pools, I was expecting much more from Bouchon. We were very promptly seated on the patio after being asked twice if we were sure we wanted to sit in the heat. We were fine with sitting outside, but being sat almost directly in the sun when there were empty tables still completely shaded was a little bit of a head scratcher. (No biggie, brush it off) A server then brings a glass of orange juice to our table and the girlfriend and I look at each other, confused. Is OJ complimentary at this fine place? Answer: No. OJ was then taken away after our server being made aware. Then comes the C & W fiasco. Oh, Chicken and Waffles, how I so looked forward to devouring you this fine Vegas morning......(Screeching halt) \""C & W is one of our most requested dishes during the week, but our chef likes to serve it as a specialty item on weekends\"" was the response from our waiter. So... you tell me how many times daily that $12 is wasted on a cab ride to NOT eat C & W on a weekday? (Yes partially my fault for not doing my research, but c'mon man) Breakfast was just OK, my corn beef hash was served first and started to get cold as we waited about 5 minutes for the girlfriends dish to arrive and her's still wasn't warm? Girlfriends food was snatched from her before she could finish. We had to ask every time we needed our coffee refilled. Not impressed. Won't be back"
0,"Oh God, another Ikea bar. Such a shame too, Drouthy Neebors used to be full of charm. Then a few years back it closed for a while and seemingly got bought out by the Swedish furniture giant who decked it out with their blandest furnishings.\n\nIn fact, this used to be one of the coolest places to drink and watch football. Now it's just a place to drink and watch football. There are still plenty of old timers in here (looking a bit bewildered) who'll chat to you, but it's lost so much of its appeal.\n\nI don't know, maybe that's the way pubs are going these days - The Maltings did it, The Southern did it. They were both excellent, now they're like every other bar. Drouthy's does have a few drinks on offer, and loads of TVs to watch the football but it just ain't what it used to be."
0,"My first time here, I got 2 skirts and two dresses dry-cleaned. One dress came back with a hole in it, which it did not have before, and the other dress not only came back with a stain still on it, but the armpits are shredded! The fabric around the armholes are all torn. Do not go here. Extremely careless and are now not picking up their phone."
0,"It is unfortunate that the service is sooo bad here and that the management doesn't even care. When I first discovered this restaurant I was so excited about the menu. The food selection and quality was excellent, but the service was some of the worst I have ever received anywhere. I always give places the benefit of the doubt as maybe it was just a rough day for everyone that I delt with. So I returned two other times before I finally had to say never again to this restaurant. My third and last attempt we took one of our out of town friends because of some of the breakfast items we raved about. We waited 35 minutes for someone to greet us. This is no exaggeration. We asked several passing by waiters and also asked to speak to a manger twice withing this time frame. When finally greeted we were greeted with the excuse \""I'm going to take care of you but I wasn't supposed to be your waitress\"" Hmmm,,,, great introduction. Then after ordering drinks it was approximately 7 more minutes before she even returned but then said she would be back to take our order. Finally our order was placed and food came out quickly. But our drinks ran dry with our waitress never returning. We asked another waiter but still no drinks and no manager visit. After finishing our meals and waiting close to 10 more minutes for the bill with our plates piled on the edge of the table we decided to leave and ask for the bill at the front. The host was too busy talking to another employee to give us any attention so we simply said rather loudly that we are walking out on our tab if we do not receive on immediately. The host and other employee thought is was funny. We never got a tab so we decided to just leave and have never returned."
1,"I love the decor and ambiance of this place. It's dark, lively, and fun. Just walking into the entrance is eye candy. Sarah surprised me with dinner here on a very windy day. Street parking only. It was on a weekday and fairly empty, so we had no problems with changing our reservation multiple times.\n\nRight away we jumped on some chips and guac. Their guacamole is very good, I was a fan of that. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered some tacos, their carnitas to be exact. Every Mexican restaurant has their own version of carnitas and these ones weren't too bad. I just felt they were missing something, it didn't have that oomph.\n\nCheck out the awesome sink in their bathroom! It's unique. Service was pretty good, but it wasn't busy so that's predictable. Seems like a fun place to drink and good for large parties with the outdoor patio area. But the food can be improved upon."
0,"During the first visit I was treated very well, the staff is very friendly and professional\nBut on subsequent visits the doctor is very cold and if you have no money for treatments make you feel that there are no other options, recommend expensive treatments and offers no alternatives."
0,"Sorry, but this place was super disappointing! We spent a good couple of hours round trip checking this place out and I would not do it again. I was not expecting to see any of the TV personalities, but I was expecting this place to have some interesting items to peruse.  This was not the case, the shop is fairly run down and dirty. The best kept, largest section was the \""Pawn Stars\""  merchandise section that for some reason dosen't show up on the TV show! I would not seek this place out or wait in-line if you are looking for anything more than a tour of where the TV show is shot!"
0,"I felt a little ill after our experience yesterday at the Verizon store. It could have been the questionable food at the Baja Fresh we ate afterward. But, no- it really was the see-sawing of our entire lengthy transaction. \n\nWe were due for the \""new every 2\"" deal, but, wouldn't you know it- the prices for the phones we wanted that Hubby had been quoted in an e-mail expired 2 days before! Then we needed to go back out on the floor to look for more affordable models. \n\nBonus point for the salesman getting Hubby a gov't employee discount on the phone plan and accessories.\n\nBonus point for finally having a device in house that will transfer your contacts and photos for you. Minus a point for his lame joke about it costing $10. Minus a point for his inability to transfer my pics when he could transfer Hubby's. \n\nMinus 2 points for screwing up the rebate process by ringing up the same phone twice, so now the UPC codes on the box and the rebate form don't match. So much for reminding us so often about the glorious $50 rebate per phone, that finally made us choose to go with the original phones we had wanted in the first place. So now I have to squeeze in a trip back to the store sometime very soon before the whole deal expires, or possibly and tragically lose my- wait for it....wait for it.... f-ing \""Verizon Debit Card.\"" WTF? The sales rep never said anything about a debit card. Can I only conveniently use it at a Verizon store? Shockingly, the rebate printout does not say specifically.\n\nI like my new phone well enough, and I have been a Verizon customer for many many years and have not ever had trouble with them. However, I don't think I'll shop anywhere but online again for my phone needs. The human factor made the shopping icky."
0,"I'm grading this Resort on \""the food only\"" not the accommodations. Occasionally, My wife loves to go to the little restaurant near the main lobby on the west side cause she likes the atmosphere. It's nice, good views and the food is of good quality. The meal prices though OMG!!! The resort must feel that if it's Troon North you'll pay the price just because. Not this camper. First, the meal prep takes wayyyyyy too long. Second, I could get a Breakfast Burrito of considerable size and quality for 6 bucks NOT $17.00!!! So if you go there, it better be one heck of a need for food or you just have so much money you're not worried."
0,"Okay, maybe I'm an overly nostalgic guy....but I miss \""Treasure Island\"".  That place was great!  \""TI\"".....\""T...I...?\""  What's that?  Some 80's detective?  \n\nUnfortunately \""Treasure Island\"" became another MGM-Mirage casualty when it became \""T.I.\"", in the \""let's become uber hip & trendy\"" era of Vegas.  I can't really say as I blame the business plan of MGM-Mirage.  The fact is, you put a few upgrades, market it as a \""chic\"" establishment, then triple your room rates and food, quadruple your drinks and add an \""ultra lounge\"" and you're making bank off of morons who try to see who can out impress each other.  \n\nI for one miss the old pirate show, the pirate theme, and yes even the skull and cross and bones sign that adorned the strip for a decade.  Like I said, I may be overly nostalgic...but really...does EVERY hotel in Vegas have to go this direction?  Maybe if they opened up a pirate themed micro-brewery, I'd change my mind and give the place four or five stars!"
0,"MAYBE BUCCA AND OLIVE GARDEN ARE NOT SO BAD!!!!!!!!!!!\n \nHello,\n \n \n  I was taken by my boyfriend to your resturat for Valentine's Day! IT WAS HORRIBLE from the service to the food! Seriously we both work in the food industry (hes a GM) and it just blew my mind how things were handled in your restaurant... 1st we sat at the bar and didn't get acknowledged so when our table was available we sat for a good 10 min before we were asked what we were drinking.... I'm assuming he was the busier he explained he could only get non-alcoholic drinks.....  We were given little 4oz glasses not even filled up? Is that a joke? The couple next to us had real water glasses!!! Then the server came about 10 min later we ordered our wine and beer... He came back with my beer and told my boyfriend they were looking for his wine.... 20 min later it was \""unavailable\"" Took over an hour to get out food as your server mike came to the table and says \""sir 10 more SECONDS!!!!!!!!!!!! really it was 30 min later we arrived at 6:45 and hadn't got our dinner till 8:20!!!! You do the math!... really spaghetti!!! Oh and Mike's excuse was that the customers who did your 5course meal were to be served be for people who ordered off the menu WHAT KIND OF ANSWER IS THAT?????YOUR MANAGER, who knew there was a problem ignored us didn't even acknowledge us!!!! Didn't even offer to buy us a drink!!!!!! The couple next to us was just as UN happy with your servers lies and excuses! They WERE your customer's for 2yrs and they wont be back... We were referred by a good friend and I promise you we will NEVER REFER YOU TO ANYONE!\nFYI Chix piccata with penne pasta and marinara???? really???? WORST 70 DOLLAR MEAL DIDNT EVEN WANT TO TIP HOWEVER I DID KNOWING IT WASNT ALL THE SERVERS FAULT!"
1,"The best Brazilian grill (even steak house) in Madison, I cannot say I haven't been to better but this one is well executed. Nothing bad to say except parking down town. Don't plan on any activities after dinner, all you will want to do is go home and lay on the couch like a over stuffed turkey. This is a very nice atmosphere (great date night) and they handle large groups well. The cost last I went was $35 a person all you can eat. For steak, lamb, chicken, pork, sausages and grilled pineapple for desert, oh don't forget about the sides, great sides. What would you get at Ruth Chis for $35?"
1,"Tried this little place out recently.  Would have never known it was there if it had not been for word of mouth.  Restaurant needs more visibility.  A Sushi bar that has fresh fish and awesome prices needs to be noticed.  The specials did not dissapoint in the slightest.  Handrolls were fresh and handed right to you from sushi chef,  Seaweed had that nice crunch to it.  Other fish items on menu were so fresh and delicious.  I do plan on coming back to write for some of my other publications"
0,"This show was okay.  I'm not a fan of Penn and Teller but the tickets were comped so I said to myself \""self, why not the thing you love the most is stuff that's free.\""  I really enjoyed the Jazz music as people were being seated and the theater itself was beautiful.  I could have done without all the political talk and some of the magic was stuff I had seen before.  The fire eating was just lame, it was Penn and some cute blonde just stuffing it in their faces.  At the end of the day my tickets were still free, but I might have been a little miffed if I would have paid for this show."
0,I came here for lunch with my coworkers and the experience was awful. The only good thing I have to say is that the waiter was on the ball with drink refills. \n\nI ordered the Thai Chicken pizza and it was drowned in cilantro. The crust was thin and rubbery as was the cheese. The pizzas are all individual sized so they are somewhat pricey. It's not worth paying so much money for so little food when there are much better places like Mama Luigis and Grimaldi's near by.
0,"Stopped by to get lunch today. Ordered  Combination Chow Fun and Wonton Soup. On the menu, the wonton soup has shrimp in it. I am allergic and told the guy behind the counter. I get my food home and notice a shrimp in the wonton soup. I go back and present my food which they gladly remake. I get home again and start eating. Halfway thru the wonton soup, guess what I find? Another Shrimp! Now I'm angry and disappointed. The blatant disregard is something INEXCUSABLE. This could have literally killed me. I will not be back due to their inability to execute a simple dish twice and potentially making me sick beyond belief. I hope the owners see my post and realize you can't disregard food allergies and  expect repeat business."
0,"It's a freaking chain but they do have decent food and good margaritas.  Unlike every other location of this chain I've been to across the country this one has some stupid rule that they have a limit on the number of margaritas you can buy...   Seriously a limit of THREE?  Do I look like an 80 pound sorority girl tasting booze for the first time or I'm I still actually a 200+ pound old rugby player, honorably discharged army vet, seasoned party professional and citizen of New Orleans that finds downing three of these things easier than Cortes conquering the Aztecs?  I  lived next to the original location of this chain in Austin and I never had to contend with such a ridiculous policy.  No other place in Tempe seems to have such a stupid policy.  The margaritas are good but they are FAR from being high octane potent!   I can understand if someone is stupid drunk being cut off but just having a blanket policy that they are going to limit the number of drinks you can buy is just plain anti-capitalist and un-American!  All I can figure is they are attempting to discourage this from becoming a college hangout...  Ah well at least there are many better LOCAL joints at a better value that don't ration out their drinks in the area."
1,This was our first time at Liberty Market. The outside seating looks comfortable and quaint. Grab a menu and put in your order at the cashier. The trouble is going to be picking what delicious item to devour. Today we tried the chicken salad sandwich and lump crab cakes.  Both were delicious !! My husband enjoyed the hot tea service of ginger peach tea. The staff is very efficient and helpful. We waited about 5 min and our food was delivered to our table. No problems recommending this place to anyone who wants great food and eclectic surroundings.
1,"Made reservations here for dinner. could have been placed at a better seat, but I have eaten here in the past and knew that I was in for a decent meal that was reasonably priced for the quality. It ALWAYS surprises me the food that comes to your table at this little place tucked into a corner of The Rio's casino... It is TOTALLY unexpected. The service is helpful and is seeming never bothered by special requests. in fact, they seem eager to meet the challenge.\nI ordered a variety of meals here over the years but my favorite is the salmon ceasar salad. I order it every time I stay in Vegas.  Upon my request the salmon is grilled to perfection.\nThis time I ordered desert. The sizzling apple pie it was delicious! The apples were soft but not soggy with a sweet tart flavor. This desert is a TRULY share\""able\"" treat!"
1,"Perfect for Sunday lunch. They served our family of 8 adults with ease.  Orders were perfect and served quickly.  Food was excellent, fresh, and very tasty!"
1,"I do not own one recording of Donnie or Marie.  I know some songs from the radio.  Had a vague recollection of them being on Dancing with the Stars.  Knew them better as The Osmonds on Andy Williams show.  So how did I wind up here?  Simple my boss and his wife wanted to go.  That pretty much makes me going.  Now it sounded forced that I attended and in a small way it was.  But I kept thinking you know they have been around one heck of a long time so they must be doing something right.\n\nDonnie has so much personality and shows a love of the audience and returns their love with many acts and signs to them.  \n\nMarie is way more shy.  At first I thought oh boy she is going to get overwhelmed my Donnie's big presence.  What Marie had was a voice.  She sang country, rock and opera.  God gave her a voice and she used it with great gusto.\n\nThey sang they danced they pleased the crowd and just as important they made me happy.  And we all know it is always about me.  LOL!!"
0,"Our server Tiffany, was great. She took care of us and deserves 4 stars.\n\nI had the stout. It was pretty good, BUT it wasn't cold. We were sitting at the bar so I know the pour wasn't sitting and waiting to be delivered. I hate warm beer, yuk.\n\nI ordered the pull pork sandwich. It was ok, not much flavor I had to salt it.\nFrench fries fried in duck grease was very yum. \n\nThe atmosphere was a bit dull for me. I'd say the whole place was set to target an older crowd 50-60 year olds.  \n\n I wont be going back to this bar.  But if you are in the neighborhood check it out, just don't go out of your way."
0,"I think Arik and Eric summed it up pretty well. WOW I was under the impression I never had to pay cover......anywhere.........EVER!! I almost had 30 years of this luck I guess because that streak was broken last night and it was not worth it IMO. I should have stayed at FEZ and followed Thomas & Rickie home. *sigh* Really!?!?! Who's idea was this anyway!?!?! I got poked and prodded like a cow here which I usually dont mind so much but there was definitely attitude here that I dont really care to experience again. I was watching the bartender \""Her name was Naomi\"" let's just say I prob wouldnt order anything but beer here and leave it at that."
1,"A must see in Edinburgh! I highly recommend getting the Explorer Pass if you plan to visit more castles - it's well worth the money and you avoid the queues at the castle! \n\nThe castle itself takes at least 2 hours to get through. You get breathtaking views of the city from all sides. Additionally, the National War Museum is fantastic; the exhibits are marvelous and interesting, with plenty of history right in front of you. \n\nIf you aren't a fan of crowds, avoid the Crown Jewels. This was the only exhibit In Edinburgh Castle I didn't enjoy simply because you are crammed into a winding hallway with numerous visitors who cannot follow a queue. If you do stop to read the exhibits on the wall, you end up stalling those behind you or get knocked into. The jewels themselves are quite lovely, but nothing to go out of your way to see.\n\nThe shops are a bit underwhelming, but the cafe provides tasty treats at an expected museum cafe rate."
0,"sent to Corporate office; We wanted to provide you with some feedback from a recent visit. We visited your Las Vegas location inside the Planet Hollywood on Friday 3/29/13, check #xxxx. This is the third time we have been there, (other visits were much better). This location did a good job with 3 hostesses bringing people in, but once seated it was all downhill from there. It took almost 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us, and the whole visit for a \""quick breakfast\"" was over 1 hour and 20 minutes (our instincts told us to leave after the initial poor service, and we did witness a table do just that behind us). The staff was horribly inefficient, I have never seen a restaurant where the wait staff did not have \""sections\"". Our server, (and the others) were taking care of tables throughout the restaurant. There were more than enough servers, it was that they were being pulled in multiple directions. Restaurant 101, rotate customers into servers sections not the other way around. When it came time to pay the check our server dropped it off and disappeared. Again after about 10 minutes we walked over to the bar staff to see if they could run our payment they said \""no and she'll find our server\"". She continued cutting up pineapple and never even tried to find her. We finally flagged her down and she took the payment but then proceeded to go help another table rather than getting us closed out. We are very disappointed, poor service for marginal food and 1.25 hours of our vacation wasted, we will not be back."
1,You must try the sweet potato ravioli! It is probably the most delicious food I have ever tasted. The margarita is my favorite drink. Tip: always have a reservation for quick seating!
0,I guess I wasn't drunk enough food was horrible and service was fkn embarrassing it took so long just place the order and of course when we got it it was all wrong !!! Fuck this place
1,"When it comes to airports, for me, Charlotte is definitely at the top of the heap.  It was a nice stop over point on our recent trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico.  US Airways, soon to be American Airlines owns this place.  The airport seems clean, fresh, modern and friendly.  Wide walkways with an atrium, nothing warmer than a curved wall of windows lined with trees and white wooden rockers.  Easy to navigate including lots of moving walkways.  Quirky and cute art displays.  There is even a replica of the original flyer flown by Orville and Wilbur Wright.  Lots of currency exchange booths.  You name it, they've got it.\n\nLots of foods choices, my travel friend of Starbucks, and bars galore.  They also have a nice variety of shopping.  This airport also has a crew of 70 airport volunteers to ensure your stop at CLT is a positive experience.\n\nI hear that they even have a large area for watching taking off and landings complete with a picnic area and park benches.  Or you can just watch from your car.  How friendly is that?  Next time I book a flight, I will try to look for a stopover in Charlotte."
0,"So like some of my fellow Yelper's I was walking the street of Liberty Ave on my lunch break with a coworker when we stumbled onto the Asian Fusion place.  Intrigued with the lunch buffet we went in to give it a try.  Um it was so odd.  First I don't think there was another person in there besides the workers.  So we ordered a drink and went to the buffet.  I started at the cold one.  Let's see there was some salad stuff but no dressing except what was either sour cream or yogurt.  I dabbed my salad with that thinking well maybe this will be ok.... NOPE it was gross, took one bite and put the plate to the side.  The hot side was even worse!  I couldn't not recognize a single thing I was eating and there were no signs explaining what the food was.  to top it off almost everything was swimming in a brown or gray colored gravy.  You would have thought me and my coworker were crazy as the plates of food piled up and up on our table as we adventurously kept trying stuff just to hate it and put the plate of food on the table to be collected.  So up again and again to try something different but it was all awful.  We left still hungry but out of time.  My coworker apologized as it was more her idea than mine to go, but we collectively agreed we would never go back.  Sad for the people there, they all seemed very nice."
1,"Bocadillo opens late until 4 am on weekends, perfect for satisfying late night snack craving! Two locations are available, one on St.Laurent above Prince Arthur, the other on Mont-royal and St. Laurent.\n\nWe had a full meal here - at 11 pm after dinner ha ha, but having passion fruit pulled pork sandwich only would make you happy, along with an imported soda - we had delicious apple soda. Also, not to missed, their tres leches is just a fantastic dessert experience!"
1,"A fresh and bright branch of the much loved Scotmid, you can stock up on groceries here, buy some classic Blossom Hill, get the latest magazine or just get some snacks if you're feeling a little peckish.\n\nAs far as corner shops go, Scotmid's are great and they always have a great selection of goodies to choose from. \n\nClean, well organised and well stocked, I really can't complain."
1,It's just flat out tough to beat their happy hour specials.  Draft Beer and Zipparitas are well priced and their wings are pretty tasty.  I'd give them a 5 but they aren't quite as great when happy hour is over and although I love their Monaco Focaccia I'm not the biggest fan of their fries/rings.  I started going with a side salad instead.
0,"Rude! Only had one cashier opened ,when .I got he did not wait on me,but sent me.over to the next one.That was closed... So I left the milk,and chip on the counter,and left.. Now I'm sorry that I spent $225.00 on fuel here!!!!!!"
1,"Hands down the best auto place in Chandler.  Honest guys with really reasonable prices.  I've gotten my brake fluid ($35), front brake pads ($130), back brakes cleaned ($58), and car alignment done here.\n\nI've always been able to bring in my car in at most 2-3 days after I called.    Couple of times I was serviced in the same day.  Waiting area is spacious (accurate to pix posted) and has WIFI.  I've always received awesome, honest service.  \n\nI won't even bother with other car shops since I've always got the best service & lowest pricing here."
1,"Definitely the best meal I had in Montreal, a place with a pretty good food scene. The sweetbreads were incredible and the waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. The desserts were very creative and delicious and the decor was modern and interesting. I would definitely love to eat here again."
0,"when we walked into our room, one of the tv cabinet door was just laying on the floor, the shower water backed up the first nite, i was showering in water that was up to my shins, plus i slipped on the lobby floor as i was checking out. the floor was wet from some cooler condensation. i landed on my left knee, it really shook me up, i had to sit for a while, it's still bruised. the security guard Donovan was courteous and helpful, but all i requested was a ice-pack and i didn't get it for 30 minutes. Donovan had to go run and get it, because whoever was getting it was lagging like mad, i was just sitting on the stairs for 30 minutes with my friends. the wet floor sign didn't show up for about 10 minutes. someone should've have been cleaning the floors. i'm glad i didn't crack my head open on the marble floor!!!"
1,"I'm a white guy that has been to the Phils 12 times and my ex-asawa is Ilonga...so I know a thing or two about the culture and food.\nI loved their food!!!!\nI tried their pork adobo...yum, namit!\nI tried their diniguan...yum sarap sarap!\nLumpia also yum yum.\nPrice is reasonable too.\nIm going back, but I may also try FRIDAY NIGHTS because they told me their is KARAOKE here on friday nights...ill go check it out"
1,"Whoa, did you hear that? It was a strange \""sucking\"" sound...really...You didn't hear it? Oh wait, I know what it was, it was Hyde Park sucking all the money out of my wallet. Silly me, how could I not have known that I entered the big leagues when I walked in this place? You're almost bound to see a few Steelers here, CEO's, and other assorted big wigs. So when you want to play in that arena, you better be prepared to pay for it. And at Hyde Park, you do. Really.\n\nBefore I comment about the food, I must make a disclaimer that I am not a huge steak fan. I suppose I enjoy a good hunk of bloody meat from time to time but all in all, I typically steer clear. Ha, ~steer~ clear, get it?!\n\nAs of winter time 2006-2007, there are really 3 steakhouses in Pittsburgh, Morton's, Ruth Chris, and Hyde Park with the latter being a newcomer only opening in October 2006. So balancing between them, I would have to say Morton's has them beat in terms of steak, but Hyde Park is a close second. Whereas Morton's concentrates on just throwing a prime piece of meat in front of you, Hyde Park likes to dress theirs up in various sauces (mostly butter-based) and give them clever names like the Lemieux, the Stargell, the Rooney, etc.\n\nWhere Hyde Park lasso's you in (trying to stick with the whole cattle theme), is on decor and service. This place looks awesome, straight up. Dark woods, big deep red drapes, white table cloths, a fireplace. nice. The place begs you to come in have some great drinks and get your chow on. But the temptation doesn't stop there. The service here is so impeccable that you feel bad not taking any of their suggestions on wine, entrees, desserts, or where the restroom is located. My waiter here was friendly, smart, pleasant, and prompt. What more do you want when you're dropping $60 for dinner (that's for one person, ahem)?\n\nA word of advice, when the waiter brings the check, simply throw your credit card in the binder, tell him or her to add 18%, and then sign without looking at the total. Follow that tip, All in all, and you'll leave here a happy, full person with a great, memorable experience. Until your credit card statement arrives but that's not for a few weeks, right?"
0,"Ambiance- This place is very nice, warm and cozy. The place is dimly lit which I  am personally comfortable with. The bar area is nice and the tables are spaced evenly throughout the restaurant. \n\nFood- I came here the night before Easter Sunday. So, I was not able to try any of the meat dishes.  The food is a bit disappointing. After you have the tapas at Firefly, it is difficult  to match the quality, quantity and taste of the food. \n\nLocation-The location is great. Across from Blue Martini and steps away from the movie theaters. Town square is a great location. \n\nPrice- A bit on the steep side. You do not get enough bang for your buck. You cannot really expect much because of the expensive rent  these places have to pay at Town Square. \n\nService - It is OK, nothing special. \n\nOverall- I am a bit disappointed. Maybe it is because of the Five Star ratings that this place received. I expected a lot."
1,"One of our routines after a movie, is to come here for a \""le petit dessert\"".\n\nIt also works before the movie as well.  LOL.  It all depends if we're doing Reverse HH next door at Pita Jungle.\n\nThere are a few G Spots in Scottsdale.  This one serves just gelato, or frozen milk as I like to think of it.  The one in Old Town has some great pizza.  \n\nSeveral Yelp'er it seems, have used up their allotment of the word \""Amazing' to describe the G Spot.  So I'll add delicious to the lexicon.  We had the Dark Chocolate and Salty Caramel last weekend, after seeing Zero Dark Thirty.\n\nGo!  Enjoy!"
0,"I used to go here a lot especially since my work was right near this restaurant. Since, I never had a long lunch break I usually order ahead of time (like 30-45mins) and pick up my order when I am on my break.  Sometimes my order is ready and other times I wait another 15mins or more.  \n\nI have gotten their burgers and shakes and it was ehhh.  I didn't really enjoy their burgers, I feel like I could better burgers at in & out for a cheaper price.  \nThe times where I have eaten there, the service was okay no one really paid much attention to us. It was basically ordered our meal and then paid for our meal.  \n\nThe place is like a 1950s diner which was pretty cool and they even had a cute little jukebox that you can put your money in and play some 50s music.  I inserted my coin and the thing didnt even work.  sighs.  \n\nOverall, I wouldn't come here or it would never be the first place I would get a burger at."
1,"Fantastic food. Simple solid classic menu. Great service from a staff that wants you to enjoy yourself. Lots of locals eat here. Limo service to Strip hotels is a great touch.., love this place, we come here whenever we get to Vegas!"
1,"I used to frequent Volcano Tea often during high school; it's where my friends and I liked to hang out and enjoy boba beverages. I stopped visiting a few years ago, primarily due to my lack of interest in boba and also because I wasn't in Chinatown as much.\n\nAnyway, sometimes I still have a craving for boba and fortunately I was in Chinatown today when it happened. The space has changed a bit with a lot less room to sit since there's more counter/work area to accommodate the addition of snow ice. It was relatively busy, but I was able to order as I entered and waited just a few minutes for my drink.\n\nI love milk tea with boba, so I always order one with just a variation of flavor. Today I went with a Large Taro Milk Tea - with boba, of course ($3.95 with tax). The tea wasn't too sweet and the boba was fabulous - soft and chewy! Oh, so yummy! I guess it's been a while since I've had good boba, but this is the stuff. I'll be back for more when I'm in the mood!"
0,"We had heard great reviews about this place, so we were excited to try it. We even took advice from people that love this place on the appetizer so as to be sure to sample something that had been vouched for.\n\nThe wait to get in was fairly long. This location was quite small, so that was part of the problem, but it also seemed popular.\n\nThe service was great. We were provided with suggestions on a completely unfamiliar menu & all requests were promptly addressed. That is were the 2 stars come from.\n\nThe food was below average at best. The bread & oil was some of the worst I've had. The bread was bland, flat, & burnt. In fact, the burnt pieces had the most flavor, albeit a charcoal flavor. We had the fried ravioli appetizers. Frozen food much? Yah, they tasted & looked like they came right out of the freezer. If they weren't, then somebody is really screwing these up in the kitchen. Finally, we shared a meatball sandwich. I mean really, that is tough to mess-up, right?? The bread was odd; some kind of flat bread instead of a hoagie bun. That bread was also burnt & the sandwich was dry. We had to request a side of sauce.\n\nThe couple we were with raved about a turkey sandwich they ordered, but a turkey sandwich with deli meat requires no cooking, so no wonder that was the best thing at the table. I seriously doubt we'll ever go back. We'd go to Brio or Carrabbas first. Hell, I'd do Olive Garden before this place."
1,"Not only did I enjoy sitting outside for a lovely ladies business lunch at Frank & Albert's last week, but I enjoyed the best Cobb salad ever!  I'm picky about chicken and this was excellent quality and delicious rotisserie chicken they used.  The combo of the other ingredients (lettuce, tomato, egg, avocado, bacon, and black olives) along with the green goddess dressing was superb.  It was a beautiful presentation too!\n\nMy dining companions' meals looked amazing as well.  I saw the Biltmore Bistro Burger, the Grilled Fish Tacos, and the B.A.L.T. (their Tuesday Blue Plate Special).  We devoured pretty much everything on the table too...\n\nThe service was a tad on the slow side but it was also a packed restaurant.  I will have to return for breakfast, dinner, and/or happy hour too as all of their menus look outstanding.  The bar/drinks menu alone has something for everyone with economy friendly prices.  If you have not yet been to the Arizona Biltmore, this new restaurant is reason to go... and since this year marks the Biltmore's 80th Birthday, there is a ton of history in the resort as well."
0,"Great place to get craft stuff until you have to check out or return something. Always understaffed, always a long line. They've eliminated their customer service desk so all returns are handled at the register. That means if you want to exchange an item, you have to wait in line for the return and then wait again to buy the new item. What a waste of time!  Lousy corporate BS customer service policies = perpetually dissatisfied customers!!!"
0,"Worst Hotel I have ever been to by far.  When we arrived at 8pm it was an hour wait to check in, followed by a 15 min wait for the elevator. Unbelievable. Then we got to our room and they gave us a smoking room when we asked for nonsmoking. When we called down they told us they didn't have any more suits available, so we stayed in the gross smoking room. The sheets were like sandpaper and the air-conditioning was so small it didn't cool the room down at all! The internet went in a out the entire night, this is crazy since you pay a $25 resort fee for internet. The bath tub was so gross we couldn't even use it. It just seemed like a grimy old hotel that was trying to be high end hotel and it was just awful. Out total for the room was $140, we ordered two dinners from room service and it was $100! Go to a nicer hotel and pay the extra $50 or $100. It's worth it. It was just gross and CRAZY busy. We even had to wait 15 mins for the elevator the next morning for breakfast, in a line!"
1,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE The Hotel!\n\nIt's a little off the strip, but I never feel the need to leave the premises when I stay here.\n\nMY ONLY Complaint you ask...\n\nNo Free coffee in the room!\n\nC'MON NOW!  Every hotel has a coffee maker in the room that you can take advantage of for free!  \n\nI thought that was a little tacky on the hotels behalf.\n\nEspecially for the price you pay to stay there...the LEAST you can do is allow your guests to enjoy a complimentary cup of joe in the morning."
0,"Food is great - well other than their wings which pretty much are fried chicken drowning in sauce.\n\nWe ordered two weeks ago using their online ordering system.  Order came all screwed up - e-mail receipt did not match the printed one at all.  Complained and GrubHub (the delivery service) gave us a $20 credit.  The food was good and I've eaten in other stores before so we tried again tonight... and where do I start?\n\nHere I guess!  Ordered online.  Got e-mail receipt including delivery time and our creidt.  I paid via credit card for the rest and included the tip.  Half hour after the estimated time (they're 1.2 miles from us) later the driver showed up.  He was very nice and very professional so he was the only positive about this experience.  He asked for the entire amount, sans credit, in cash.  We were puzzled but he showed no credit.  He got his phone out and called the store manager and let my husband talk to him.\n\nAt that point we got told that $20 credit was a store credit only - which baffles me as I had to click to apply the dang thing on GrubHub - and we could only use ordering directly.  He did at least finally let us pay via credit card, and I still feel bad we had no cash to tip the driver as we'd put the tip on the original credit card payment that never showed up.\n\nSo... if you want to eat in, I guess they're great and at least our order was mostly correct this time -although I am still utterly baffled why when I specicially ask any pizza place in this state for red peppers and cheese why they can't deliver those - but we will never use/order from Rosati's and/or their GrubHub counterpart again."
1,"I have stayed here twice when coming to Vegas. This location is perfect! Right next to Planet Hollywood, in the middle of all the chaos, but still far enough away to feel secluded! \n\nThe first time I came here, there was a lot of construction going on. It was really a bummer because this was supposed to be a vacation, and I was woken up as early as 7am every morning by the noise of the workers. I thought I'd give it a second shot, seeing that I've stayed in most every other hotel on the strip and still enjoy the Hotel's location. \n\nI found this location through interval, so I knew it was something special! The rooms are gorgeous, and there has been a lot of construction since I was here last. They serve Starbucks, have a bar and grill, have a new pool, and so much more! \n\nMy room has a perfect sized kitchen, great living room, massive dinner table, a gigantic bath tub and huge shower, and the adjoining room is spacious with a table, desk, and great sized bathroom. \n\nThe downside is they don't provide housekeeping, so I tend to find myself on less of a vacation when I'm taking out the trash, making my bed, and cleaning up after the slobs I came with! Guess I have to choose my company more wisely ;)"
1,Happy hour gets crazy busy! Must be the fantastic chambord margaritas (limit 3) and appetizers! I'm a huge fan of the Tejas trio dips and the pecan crusted chicken salad.
1,They are extremely generous with the cream cheese on their bagels. The service is very fast and friendly at the same time.
1,I've been a patient for about 3 years now and each visit just gets better each time. The dental assistants are always friendly and help put you at ease even when that big bright light is the last thing you want to see not to mention those instruments (oh horror!). Dr. Ben Truong's friendly demeanor and professionalism also greatly reassure you when discussing your treatment plan and options.
1,"Food was so good! Got the caprese salad, with the most delicious variety of tomatoes and sweet delicious balsamic and basil. The white Little Yorks pizza was so yummy too! Lots of delicious Italian meats. Wine selection was great, we got the red blend. Enjoy! This is get you in the Italian country side mood food! The only regret you'll have will be that your next stop isn't Tuscany!"
0,"SO DISAPPOINTING!!!  Cartwright's was our favorite restaurant for special occasions and just for a nice evening out.  Last May we had  our daughter's in town and enjoyed the usual fantastic experience.  In November we returned looking forward to a wonderful dinner and couldn't believe how bad it was!!!  We even asked if there had been  a change of ownership, chef etc. but received NO to all our inquiries.\n\nThe menu is so unbelievably weird that the Chef must have been high on something when he composed it and tried to put the most unusual combination of ingredients into each and every item!  It took us forever to decide what to order!!!  I finally had the Turquoise Salad - ok and we shared a ribeye.  We specifically asked for unseasoned\nsteak so the flavor is not disguised.  However, when it came we could tell it had been\nmarinated and covered with black pepper that had been scraped off to satisfy us  without recooking the steak. The server said \""all their steaks are marinated\"" --- a bad sign of cheaper cuts!  \n\nThe service was spotty as the waiter flew by and occasionally stopped by.  I noticed an adjoining table of 6 were also as disappointed as we were in the service and the food.\nWHAT HAPPENED CARTWRIGHT'S!?!?!?!?!  PLEASE GO BACK TO YOUR OLDER WONDERFUL WAYS -- the place was impossible to get into to and now I doubt that's a problem.  We know FOR SURE WE WON'T BE RETURNING and friends of ours have said the same thing ----- SO VERY SAD!!!!!"
0,"Tequileria Grill is located next to the C-5 terminal, next to the Jose Cuervo Tequileria. Please keep in mind that this is a review of the food, not the alcoholic drinks here, so I'm coming from a slightly different perspective than the other reviews below mine.\n\nI ordered the Carne Asada Corn Tacos (3 for $11 + tax ~ $12 as of 08/30/2014) and was treated to a fairly yummy mix of red onions, barbecued pork, some guacamole-like sauce, and what I think is cilantro. To be honest, i was pretty happy with the food, but am still wincing about paying $12 for it. I attached a picture below, which makes the tacos look bigger than they actually are. What was even weirder is that they (or at least my cashier) did not give water cups.  She told me to wait in line at the Burger King next door (which would've been another 15 minutes)!  Common!\n\nKeep in mind there's not really seating at the \""Grill\"" area and the Tequileria attached to it is dim and more designed for lonely flyers.\n\nI would probably recommend it over your other options at Burger King and Sabarro next door, but I am pretty peeved about their tourist-trap pricing and the way they try to force you into buying an overpriced beverage."
0,"d'Vine has the potential to be a better restaurant. I ended up here because my date suggested it. I was going to give it 3 stars but there were a few things that kept me from doing even that.\n\nLet me start off by saying that the restaurant is in a very nice, if not a little off the beaten path, of south, south Chandler. The inside has a nice, cozy feel to it, albeit a little on the dark side. Our table, in particular, was lacking in basic lighting. Anyway, that's just a tiny complaint compared to the service and the food. \n\nAh, the service! At first it seemed as though things might go pretty well in this area. We were promptly seated, asked about our drinks and even managed to put in an order for an appetizer, all within 10 minutes of sitting down. Not bad. The food came out pretty fast but I don't think it was anything to write home about. It wasn't spectacular, just ok. I received my drink, called the Pink Puppy, and I had read in a couple of other reviews on here how \""wonderful\"" it was. I wasn't impressed. I guess this place just shoots for mediocrity because that's all it was--mediocre. \n\nLuckily, I was so distracted by my charming date that I didn't realize until my stomach started grumbling again, that I was still hungry. A few strips of calimari split between two people isn't very filling. At that point, I realized we had probably been chatting for a full half hour or more and our waitress was nowhere to be seen (it was later on when I got up to go to the bathroom that I understood why she was MIA. I'll get to that in a minute.) Finally, she must have noticed my date doing his head-bob to get her over to the table. We were able to get our order in for the main entree. I ordered the salmon dish over risotto. It was, again, just okay. Tasty, but I don't think I would rush back to order it again. The center was a tad underdone, but I eat sushi on a regular basis so I didn't complain. The risotto was a bit mushy but still had some flavor to it. The real disappointment was in the dessert.  We ordered the chocolate mousse pie/cake--not quite sure which one it was trying to be. The texture was so bad I couldn't eat but a few bites. There was nothing \""mousse-y\"" about it. It had the consistency of dried out Play-doh. Yuck! And I am a dessert person, 't boot! I love my sweets and can eat just about anything with sugar in it. This was inedible. I'm not sure why we didn't send it back and our waitress never questioned why 3/4 of a supposedly decadent dessert was still on the plate. \n\nAfter dessert I got up to go to the bathroom and saw why our waitress was so slow in coming to our table: She was too busy chatting it up with the other customers to pay attention to her tables. \n\nSo, in summing it up here is my take on this restaurant:\n\nGood atmosphere\nMediocre food\nBad service\n\nNot a winning combination if you are a small business trying to make strides in today's economy. This establishment needs to really take a look at itself (and these reviews!) and improve where improvements need to be made. I find it very interesting that this place is owned by the same folks who have a d'Vine location in Mesa. That restaurant fairs much better in the Yelp ratings. I wonder why two places owend by the same people have such different ratings."

1,"Finally had the opportunity to visit Lux after such a long time of trying! Wow I can't believe it took me so long. This is such a cool concept and I'm so glad that it's here in DTN Phx!  From when you walk in you can see this place is a coffee shop, bakery, beer and wine bar, and restaurant all in one. Oh almost forgot, just 1 huge hangout spot! I felt totally relaxed talking to a group of friend over drinks. \n\nI specifically ordered the green tea and it was suggested I try the pinnacle mango flavor and I'm glad I ordered it. Very yummy. Wife ordered the six shooter which she could only finish half way, talk about a Jolt!! Basically coffee with 6 shots of espresso! Might be good for late night cram or a cross country road trip.lol.\n\nI got a chance to walk around and there are lots of rooms where you can study or meet with people. Plus I saw a bar where you can sit in front off as well as a few couches. Overall this place rocks. Soon my favorite coffee shop in Phx. Reminded me of a modern day Willow House from back in the day!  I just wish I lived closer so I could actually call Lux my neighborhood coffee shop."
1,"A grumpy old lady to greet you and seat you, check.\n\nA busser that does not want to be there, check.\n\nA server that doesnt even know you are there, check.\n\nYou are in a chinese restaurant alright. If you are thinking that you pay all those money to go to a restaurant for service, then do not go to real chinese restaurant. This people run the restaurant like its open in Hong Kong. Come here just for the price and the food. Flag if you need anything, dont complain too much and your food should be just fine.\n\nIf I rate this restaurant for its service and stuff, three is max. But to me, a restaurant main selling point is the food. If the food quality is top notch, I will come back. The extra star is for economical price. Anytime you can get a nice fried flounder for $6.95 is ok with me."
1,"I walk my dogs past Gloria's regularly. This year instead of throwing money down on some flowers to a overpriced mega chain, I decided to see what this shop I had passed many times had to offer. I'm glad I did. \n\nI was helped right away and shown a variety of options. Gloria worked with me on my budget and got me exactly what I had envisioned. Flowers were ready at the agreed upon pick up time and looked great!"
0,"I'm never going back there. The service was bad. Staff members were snobby. They didn't make me feel welcomed at all. On my first day there, i arrived too early (6 am), so I had to wait until 8 am to check in. Then I had to wait until 2:20 pm before I could go to my room. The staff member told me I could call before 3 pm to check if the room was ready.  When I called, a female staff member answered the phone, and spoke to me with an attitude. Her tone of voice was not pleasant. At the buffet restaurant, I asked for a new set of silverware, and the waitress asked me, \""Why?! That's not enough?\"" Duh! I wanted a CLEAN set of silverware! I wasn't about to use the same fork that I used for Fettuccini Alfredo the entire time there. To top everything off, the stamp vending machine took my money without giving me a stamp. The Monte Carlo people weren't gonna do anything for me. They told me to call the post office. I wasn't gonna waste my time for that. I had the same type of experience with the stamp vending machine at Luxor, but they gave me my money back when I went to the cashier. The Luxor staff members were a lot more friendly and helpful."
1,LOVE this place. Staff if always very pleasant. Every time I go it's a positive experience. The breakfast was great. It tastes like mom's home cooking. The burgers a great. It was $4 and some change for a cheese burger and fries. CHEAP for good a quality meal. I look forward to trying new things on the menu.
1,"I loved the basic fish taco they serve.  It is simple yes, but delicious.  I wasnt a fan of the sides but the tacos definitely made up for the lacking.  Our waitress was really friendly and very attentive.  I am definitely going back  when I move to Charlotte."
0,"The product is usually decent but to say I was disappointed with the last order of 3 canvases is an understatement. One arrived damaged and it's been almost 3 weeks trying to get them to even respond to my emails trying to get a replacement sent out. I don't know about the rest of you guys but when a canvas arrives damaged and with the canvas bubbling out, one would expect at least a timely response to your emails, after asking me to send pictures of the damage it's been 2 weeks since they've even bothered to respond, either hire more people to handle the influx of complaints or fix your manufacturing process. Poor customer service. To give you an example of good customer service, I experienced a damaged canvas before from pix 2 canvas and the one time out of many they sent me a damaged canvas after one phone call being on the phone about 3 mins they had a new one in the mail and delivered to me within 4 days. This company on the other hand after multiple calls and emails asks for multiple pics as if they don't trust you and you can barely even get a response from what seems to be the one person who works their customer complaints department. Unhappy customer to say the least."
1,"I don't even know what to make of south american influenced sushi but why the f**ck not. this place is worth try, better than throwing your money at gambling (don't kill me ghosts of Las Vegas' Past)\n\n I felt I could have shoved a few sushi rolls up my butt to get some attention in this place but whatevers. I liked what I had, but seriously you better be dipping my sushi in some beluga caviar to justify these prices. All I'm saying is, why is every place is Las Vegas so dingy? The cleanliness of some of these places is really atrocious. I just expect a little less worn in place for the price is all i'm saying."
0,"Sunday evening and I decided to have dinner and found Gardunos.  The place was decent enough and had a pretty good atmosphere.  Didn't have to wait long to be seated at the time.  The waiters were tentative at a 4 on a scale from 1-5.  The drinks were pretty good as well, although one of them \""Mexican Seguas\"" had about as much sugar as glass of Hawaiian punch.\n\nNow let's talk about the food.  On a scale of 1-5 the food overall gets a 1.5.  I had a chile relleno, a shredded beef burrito, and something they call green chili clam chowder.  The chile relleno was rubbery and tough, the shredded beef enchilada was pretty dry and the green chile clam chowder had too much going on... carrots, potato, celery.  I think there were maybe 2-3 small bits of clams something.\n\nSad to say I don't see myself revisiting this place again."
0,"Service sucks!! There was at least five people in the back and the lady who was taking orders was only catering to one couple. Uhm hello, it's hot in your store and I don't feel like waiting 10 minutes to get my order when there were clearly other people that could've helped us. \n\nI didn't order anything because I was at the point where I wanted to just leave when they started taking our order. HUBBZ got a large \""fresca\"" and son got double scoop of vanilla with toppings, $6.75"
0,"Horrid service and terrible food. Friday night at seven with an empty dining room should have been my first clue.\nThe waitresses and waiters have the personalities of a brick wall. I've had better revive at a gas station. \nMy wife had the New York steak and veggies. Her steak was about a half inch thick but she said it was ok. I ordered fish and chips. Both our meals came with a salad and a role. I love salad dressing or anything that hides the taste of anything that looks like a vegetable but my salad was swimming in dressing. There were floating croutons and a life raft that looked like a cucumber. The roll was good.\nMy fish and chips were among the worst I have ever had. I have had better fish and chips in an elementary school. The fries tasted like they had been sitting around for a few hours and the pieces of fish were dripping with grease. The coleslaw was brown and looked bed. I wasn't even willing to try the coleslaw. The fish was over cooked so the meat was tough and dry and the batter was a dark brown that tasted like the grease was weeks old.\nWhen I told the waiter that my meal was so bad, he chewed me out and told me I should have told him sooner. He did offer me something else but I declined. He said he has replaced meals \""many times.\"" This should be a problem in his eyes. He did take the meal off our bill but did charge us for the salad. Amazing that they would nickel and dime a patron who had a bad experience. My whole meal should have been removed from the bill. When this restaurant first opened, many years ago, there were long wait times but the food and service was great. THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE.\nsave yourself some time, money, and a stomach ache, avoid the Sundance Grill at the Silverton."
0,"The first time i went to this bar I was satisfied with the service. The staff were friendly and attentive. I was at the bar playing video poker. My drinks and food were both comped as I played for a few hours. Then the second and third time I went the bartending staff were rude and appeared as if they were doing me a favor by pouring me a drink while I was sticking money into their machines. The third visit two of us were playing on the same machine for at least three hours continuously and they only comped us one drink each. The bartender was talking to what appeared to be her friends sitting next to me not playing on a machine and was comping their drinks - probably with my play! When I asked about their comping procedure, the bartender was rude and just walked away. I payed for my drinks with exact change and no tip. I will never go back there! They shouldn't advertise themselves as a gaming bar when they actually are trying to be a club - with club priced drinks - that is sponsored by people who play."
0,"Mediocre food from the rudest group of employees I've ever seen. \n\nWe walked inside and were rudely told to go wait outside while the woman took the order of the group who came in AFTER us. There was another group waiting outside with us. They were just as confused as we were. After standing outside waiting for about 10 minutes with no sign of the order taker, my husband went in to see if they were ready for us, she yelled at him to get back outside. Again, no one ever came to take our order or invite us in after the line died down. We finally just went in anyway and she eventually took our order. \n\nAfter finally placing our order slooooowly getting to the cashier, the employees started yelling at each other because too many customers were coming in from outside. The lady behind us nicely tried to explain our confusion and offer help to get people to wait outside like (apparently) they're supposed to. The cashier started SCREAMING at the poor lady! We had just paid or I would have walked out. \n\nWe had planned on putting in a meat market order but couldn't wait to get the hell outta there!\n\nGot home and they forgot one of our sides. Food was ok but not worth the hassle at all. There are much better BBQ joints with nice employees to help you."
1,A great place for healthy meals with a variety of options to choose from. I eat here a few times a week as I frequently order meals for pick up through chow now.
0,"Good selection and lots of toys but the mark-up on some items is insane... and borderline criminal.\n\nPrices on cables are insane.\n\nI needed a Firewire 800 cable.  The only one they carry is a Belkin.  $49.99.  Amazon sells the EXACT SAME THING with shipping for $15.  Even Belkin themselves have the list price at $39.99.\n\nThey know most people will buy things like Blu-Ray players and then will pay jacked up prices for the accessories to go with it.  Very insulting and 1990s-ish.  Now any idiot like me can price-check on a cell phone.\n\n(Worth noting: my issue isn't with this particular location, which seems just as nice and exactly the same as 8 bajillion other Best Buys)"
1,"Located in the food court in the Paradise Valley Mall surrounded by fried food, junk food, and fast food, you will literally find your healthy oasis. Moga Crepes offers fresh fair with a healthy alternative. You can choose from crepes, rice bowls or garden bowls.  From there, you pick your protein, add some fresh cut vegetable choices, sauce and boom: excellent fresh fair at a value price. Options include spinach, spring greens, peppers, etc. amongst many others. I had a garden bowl with chicken, quinoa, spinach, red and banana peppers and mushrooms sauteed in pesto sauce served on a bed of greens and topped with feta cheese. AMAZINGLY delicious. I predict this establishment is going to go far and will soon be in many more locations. The dessert crepes look great too."
1,"Ok so I'm going to make this easy.\n\nA. You go through the kitchen to get in the place (so badass)\nB. Louis makes the best martini you can possibly have. (so badass)\nC. They gave these chips out like 10 or 20 years ago, that grant the holder   \n      free dessert for life, I happened to know a few peeps who have these   \n      legendary chips. (free dessert poker chips so badass)\nD. finally the food is good a bit expensive and the service is always  \n     amazing."
1,make your own pizza! wow this is such a good price for the size of the pizza and what you want on it! they give you so much toppings compared to any other pizza joints. the only trouble i had was to take it home! it barely fit in the passenger seat so i had to drive carefully and not to slam on the breaks so i wont lose my dinner lol. ALSO im a small asian and this pizza is bigger than me! \n\nit took awhile to cook at home. i baked it in the oven it was a bit watery so i put my slice in the small toaster to dry it up a bit and to make the crust crispy. pizza is better when the crust is a bit crispy. \n\noverall i like this pizza place! \n\nif your starving and want to eat pizza right away... this isnt the place for you cuz you have to bake it yourself!
0,"Food is so very average which works fine for some people. But the service I received deserves exposure. I lunched here last month with my elderly aunt. We walked into the restaurant 4 minutes prior to opening, however the doors were open. No one at the hostess station so we waited. A few minutes later my aunt, anxious to show this restaurant to me, suggested we look out at the patio to determine if it would be warm enough to lunch there.  While walking to the patio a woman barked \""Ladies, ladies! We aren't yet open!\""  My aunt tried to explain what we were doing when this woman, the hostess, walked back into the kitchen. We returned to the lobby & waited. The woman returned, no greeting, no smile, no nothing! She just picked up menus & said, \""This way.\"" So we said we'd like the patio if it seemed warm enough. She said nothing, just walked us out the door to the patio. On the patio was a mop bucket and several freshly hosed down tables - soaking wet.  I said we'd prefer the dry tables inside.  Snarky hostess again said nothing, just raised her eyebrows and motioned us inside.  Our server was fabulous but that hasn't changed my opinion of this place. Get over yourselves. You have a mediocre product. For me to return to a place my initial impression must be very good.  Very disappointing."
0,"Cab driver (Michel R. Moreno) picks up me and a friend at the airport.  He takes the long way to the strip (not really a surprise -- my fault for not being clued into his tricks).\n\nThen, while driving erratically and at too high a rate of speed, Michel realizes he is about to miss the right exit.  He changes lanes without looking and clips the back of a car in the right lane.  The accident was clearly the cab driver's fault.\n\nWell, now the cab driver is angry.  I kinda want to cut him some slack because yeah, now his day is pretty much ruined.  But he's not only mad at the driver of the car HE just hit, he's mad at me and my friend because after 15 minutes of waiting for his supervisor to arrive, we tell him we don't want to wait for his supervisor, we just want to get to our hotel.\n\nIt gets worse.  Michel insisted that we pay.  I know this may be hard to believe.  But in his broken English, Michel made it very clear that we MUST pay for this ride.  He said we \""can't get something for free.\""\n\nI didn't want to fight with the guy so I paid.  The supervisor said later we would be refunded (still hasn't happened).\n\nIt was a really awkward experience.  I honestly would have felt safer in an Uber driven by a 17 year old who had had a few beers."
1,"This place gets stars because it is open 24 HOURS!! Yes. All the time. I wish it served a variety of foods, but sadly they just do sandwiches. Still, The fish sandwich was great and so was the coleslaw, which is not mayo-based but more kraut-like or middle eastern style. The fries in the sandwich were actually a nice touch too."
0,"I'm giving this place 2 stars and only because the food was good. The waitress, Crystal, on the other hand was terribly aloof and snobbish and clearly did not want to be there. She was slow and we had to constantly get up to flag her or someone down. Please keep in mind there were only 2-3 other tables and they had their own servers. I can understand when someone is having a bad day but this girl was ridiculous. If you get annoyed when even taking orders then maybe you need to get a new job."
0,If I could I wouldn't given them any stars.I will NEVER stay at the Quad ever again. The rooms are disgusting the  service desk rude. I was over charged and told to basically stick it. This is by far the worst hotel experience ever.
1,"I really like this place. I've been to the San Diego location as well. They both have friendly staff and great food. Large portions, of course, so please do your homework and don't over-order, otherwise it'll seem too pricey. Las vegas location has more seating area than SD's."
0,"Two hours later, still waiting. Others checked in after me seen. Service has gone downhill in the past year. And new policy of holding debit card isn't the best. Harder to fight inaccurate charges"
1,Extremely good selection or Native art and jewelry! Went in for a pair of free earrings and came out with beads that I have been searching high and low for. The staff was very helpful and polite and even stopped for a nice chat. Worth the trip!
0,"I will give a negative if I can. Horrible experience. It is a mommy mill,  charge extra for everything, stuff are always in a rush. I have to change my ob doctor after 3 months of services"
1,"Since this place is conveniently located near me, it's an easy place to take my car to get clean.  The girls at the counter are usually pretty pleasant.  They issued me a punch card so after my 10 visits, I get one free!  Love it! \n\nI was never really sure of the proper procedure but I would go in to pay first.  Then I just drive my car to the 'starting line'.  The gentlemen usually working there are very gracious and quick about coming over to greet me.  From there it's about a 5-10 minute wait for completion.  There are plenty of seats to wait either inside or out to watch the finishing touches.  After it goes through the wash, they thoroughly dry it off and dust the entire inside.  Every time my car is perfect again with not a speck of dirt or water spot.  They have done an amazing job with every visit and I am a happy girl.  \n\nMy tip ~ Early bird discount on car washes done between 7 - 9 am.  $2 off"
1,"A great new Fox Concepts restaurant! Good food, reasonably priced drinks and cozy patio. I will definitely go back again."
1,"This was the first pub we saw as we headed toward our Alaska Airlines gate during World Cup so we walked in and popped down in front of the bar which had about 6 TVs visible - perfect! Service was awesome, the guys behind the bar will definitely take great care of you, and the food was great as well. My friends and I were stuffed before we got there but still managed to grab a few drinks along with some string beans, asparagus, cheese cake, and ice cream (hey, we were on vacay!) After all that, we were REALLY stuffed, and then noticed that patrons around us ordered the calamari which looked bomb, so I'd recommend that even though I didn't try it, cuz I know my calamari by sight and am confident enough in my abilities to make such a recommendation."
0,"I love Indian food, when I lived in toronto I lived and breathed Indian food. But this overpriced slop this restaurant tried to serve me was not Indian food. If you like loud music coupled with abysmal Indian food by all means go to Karma. However, if you any sense of what Indian food is supposed to taste like; Do yourself a favor and skip Karma, your taste buds will thank you."
0,"I was looking for a better pizza than my Little Caesars or Dominos near my home. Being the discounter, I found that Papa John's had a decent pizza for a nice price. I built my pie online and set up a carryout option with cash payment. Soon I received a confirmation email with all my order information and an ETA of about 20 mins or so. I sent my boyfriend within ten mins to go pick our dinner up. When he arrived, the front counter attendant couldn't find our pizza; leaving Joe to wait an additional thirty mins or so. (He was at the correct location) The attendant then handed my boyfriend TWO pizzas. Clearly, not our order!!  After finding what they thought was our pie based on the ingredient selection, it was luke warm at best and had a sticker for a different client and phone number. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with our experience. I never write reviews-certainly not a bad one-; however, I needed to tell you readers.... Rosati's is worth the gas OR try another location."
0,The food arrived quick. It took them no time at all to pull the bolognese sauce out of the can.  The only thing good about the restaurant is the location. But it does not make up for the meals. Not going back.
0,"This place is an absolute joke.\n\nWith a million other casino options on the Strip DO NOT waste your time, energy and most importantly MONEY in this hole.\n\nSat down with my boyfriend and a friend at the electronic Roulette table.  The \""dealer\"" came around to collect our buy-ins and went back to type them into her computer.  We played a couple rounds and another girl came to switch out the dealer.  It was ALL down hill from there.\n\nFirst she mistakenly added another person's buy in to our tab.  We were fine with this error and realized she needed to adjust it...but in order to do so she cancelled all of the bets we had made for that round... meaning we did not get any of the money that we had rightfully won.\n\nShe called for help 3 or 4 times in a matter of minutes because she had NO IDEA what she was doing and finally a floor manager named Vince/Vincent came to her rescue.\n\nUnfortunately, he was worse than her.  He did not understand the situation and acted as though we were getting upset because she had made the mistake of adding more money.  NO we were actually upset because she had made multiple errors in a matter of minutes and had wrongfully canceled our bets when we would have won money.  He accused my boyfriend of cussing at him (which he did not), and tried to make the situation better by saying \""Well, everyone makes mistakes\"".  Harrah's does not train their employees...if she was still learning the process she should have had a manager or someone who knew what they were doing by her side the entire time.\n\nSpoke to the manager who told us he would follow up with Vince but unfortunately, Vince's awful customer service, rude accusations, and poor staff training will mean that me and my friends will NEVER return to this establishment.  I advise that you avoid this place at all costs."
0,I am very unhappy with my service. I have never gone to your place before so I decided to go to your durango location. When I pulled up to enter no one acknowledged my present I waited in my car for 10 minutes till finally someone not the three people already out there finally came out and waved me in. I got the 49.99 car plan with the super interior cleaning. The driver told me it would be an 1 hour and15 minutes for the cleaning. So I patiently waited in the waiting area. He called me for my car. So I got in and pulled into the shell gas station to pump gas. My passanger seat was pulled up all the way up which was odd because it was not like that before. When I pulled the seat back I revealed a circle of dried up frosting on my carpet that was there before. The man had vacuumed the carpet around the stail and hid the stain by pulling the se. Up. I am not happy at all that was the reason I wanted to get my interior cleaned I made sure to ask him for a plan to clean the floors and he suggested this one. As I pulled out of the gas station a banging noice had started to occur as my wheels rotated. The noise subsided and I no longer hear it. And as well as I noticed while pulling out that there where hand prints on my windshield that was apparent that the inside of my windshield was not cleaned at all. As well as an oilly substance was left all over my front console ie my radio and thermostat. This has been far my worst car cleaning.
0,Just. No. \n\nThey rushed all of our mani/pedis. Looked like I could have done them. Not worth it. At all.
0,"The last time I went into this location was 09/30/2014 (my birthday) and the coffee was awful. There was actually no coffee in it only cream. This location is not consistent with the coffee, lately it has been terrible. I wrote to the corporate office and was told I would hear back from the location, but never did. I guess they don't need me as a customer. I have been going to Dutch Bros on Litchfield/Indian School, and they are always friendly and the coffee is awesome!! It's Dunkin Donuts loss because I was going there several times a week, but not anymore."
1,"I stayed here for one night with a friend while I was on the last night of my business trip. To be honest, I really wasn't that impressed. It is a nice hotel and the rooms are nice, but nothing really that special at all. I will say they had a really good gym with a lot of equipment and my friend did see Robert De Niro walking through the gym. Overall a nice hotel, nothing really flashy. I doubt I would choose to stay here on my own."
0,"I guess if you are going for drinks and typical bar food you would give this place more stars.  I bought a groupon to try the place and was expecting more of a restaurant / bar than just a bar.  I was not sure how to spend my Groupon after seeing it was just a bar (I don't drink).  After trying the food I was waiting for Gordon Ramsey to come through the door but he never did.  So go for the drinks, definitely not the food.  Tried 3 things on the menu and none were good.  The waitress was very good though so kudos to her."
0,I completely agree with Ryan M. He could not have said it better. I had lived at this property since 2005 and left after it turned into a police state. Once you get on their shitlist they do not let up. I received a notice for hazardous driving in the parking lot when I was out of the country for that month! When I went to them to report this error I was told that when I am away I am responsible for anyone driving my vehicle. The vehicle sat in my garage the entire time I was gone. No one else has keys.\n\n It's BS like that that really stresses you out and makes day to day living really suck. I dont get how these people live with themselves policing other people like this. And the guy who reviewed the security company - yeah they were pretty cool at times - but that has nothing to do with the HOA. A separate review should be written for that company.
1,"Great hotel, nice rooms and good service. I only stated here once and I haven't been back so for the record it's not nice enough to come back to but it wasn't bad at all."
1,Love the flavors and vibe great dessert treat. It is a bit spendy but this is no plain old ice cream it is a bit more than that in taste and quality!
0,I have ate here a lot and got it to go. Today we ordered my pizza and wings TO GO and they marked it dine in. So my wings came out 10 mins before pizza was done. Making my wings get cold as I waited for the pizza to get done.
0,"Darren's recent review of Kmart got me thinking about this place. I was out this way recently and I stopped to look for a place to eat. Man, talk about a dead mall! Parkway Center Mall even has its own listing on www.deadmalls.com I'd only been here once or twice back in its heyday. Back then it had Chi-Chi's (where thankfully I never ate. A hepatitis scare did them in), David Weis, Pharmor, CompUsa, Syms, etc were all here. \n\nNow the mall is mainly deserted. Only one floor is still open, and even that's got a vacancy rate of about 50%! Surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business. Kmart is doing okay as is the Giant Eagle. Phantom of the Attic is alive and well and so is Pittsburgh Sports Deli. That's not an eatery either. It's a sports memorabilia store. \n\nThere wasn't much reason for me for me to linger here though.  I soon left and went over to Olive Garden for lunch."
0,"Went to see friend's band on a Friday night, and place was completely empty besides those who were there to support the 3 bands. Much different place than when Dos was here."
1,"We tried the $20 trick and got upgraded to a great room with a view overlooking the pool, Eifel Tower, and the Bellagio fountains. The room was really nice and beautifully decorated, with a HUGE plasma tv. I like that the shower that the adjustable massaging spray nozzles in addition to the shower head. J fell asleep waitng for me because I refused to get out of the shower... hheehee oops.\n\nMy only complaint is that the bed was a little too soft to my liking. But It's centrally located and affordable so i really shouldn\""t be complaining. Oh well, dissatisfaction and high expectations run in the family..."
0,"The only thing I like about JET is my favorite Vegas promoter...BRAD! Brad seriously hooks it up whenever I'm in town with friends (which is pretty often). Brad, my friends and I love you! \n\nThe main room is always severly cramped, but then again so is every other dance floor in Vegas. I just feel like it's not really worth it to get a table here since they all fall within the \""whatever\"" category. I definitely prefer going into the smaller room because there's a lot more room to move around and it is much easier to get a drink."
1,"Went to Captain Steve's for lunch today.  The service was great, the food came fast, even though we slightly customized it.  The food was excellent and we had no complaints of any kind.  This was our first time and we will now be regulars."
0,"I have never heard of Culver's before and I was dying to try their frozen custard. I got there 10 minutes before they closed. I felt kind of bad but the staff told me that if I got there a minute before they closed they would still serve me. I ordered the sourdough melt combo and a scoop of their frozen custard. The sandwich was alright, the french fries were flavorless, and the frozen custard wasn't anything special. I was really disappointed. It seems like a lot of people like this place and I don't know why don't believe the hype."
1,"Good fresh tasting food, service was quick even at lunch hour."
0,"Went here because the UofA Phoenix alumni held a viewing party for Wildcats baseball game.\n\nI agree with the other reviews: they are understaffed. They had 3 waitresses for about 40+ people. I was disappointed because they took 50 minutes from taking our drink orders to our food orders. Even after writing down what we wanted the waitress still forgot what beers my friends' got and we had to check up with the girl after 15 minutes and had to repeat their drink orders. Service got better at the end of the night (made sure our food was ok, refilled our drinks, and split the checks without complaining), but the beginning of the night left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nFood was made quickly but it was nothing to brag about: our whole table ordered burgers and they are all just slight variations of one another. Even the salsa/chips appetizer was mediocre: most of the chips were crushed up and the salsa seems store-bought (other sports bars I've been to have made their own salsa, so call me a snob I guess).\n\nOne bright side was that there was an open bar for 30 minutes after the Cats won. But overall, a less than pleasant experience."
0,"Trendy, good ambiance, but overpriced. Prices reflect the trendiness, not the quality of food. I am a vegetarian and ordered one of two veggie options, and taste-wise, it was \""fair\"". Expected better taste for the price ($18 for stir fry).  They were able to seat our large party of 8, though."
1,"A very tasty breakfast which helped with some sore heads and hungry bellies. My french toast was easily the best I have ever tried. My cheese loving boyfriend went out of his way to try the highly recommended smoked cheese and needless to say it was hard to make him leave. We even got free coffee because they weren't happy with their new blend, but we thought it was pretty decent! Only improvement would be a quicker service, the waiter was painfully slow at times!"
1,"The decor was nice, service was good and the miso glazed Chilean sea bass is on the top 5 most delicious things I've ever eaten list! Next time I'm in Vegas I am definitely visiting Tao again!"
1,I like it. They have good coffee and great food. The wifi is strong and it's cozy. It's a very comfortable spot to get work done. A lot of coffee shops have turned into pick up joints or high school hang outs. This is just a nice indie coffee shop like you see in LA and the parking is plentiful  \n\nMy only complaint is that lunch items are not served in the evening or late afternoon.
0,"never stayed at this hotel. Just being in the lobby creeped us out! it was humid and just filled with smoke. We almost RAN out of there. We just wanted to see all the famous hotels of LV. couldn't imagine staying there. Oh we went to the restaurant there just to look, and we died laughing. lol it smelled terrible. We cld not understand why or how cld ppl eat there."
0,Before buying the yearly membership make sure you follow up on it.  we have been waiting for over a month for our family membership cards and called again today and said its going to take another 2 more weeks. whoever is processing this paperwork is slacking big time...
1,"Great food!  We had a party of 8 and ordered \""The Feast\"" which is literally one of everything on the menu (minus a few more expensive items).  It says it feeds 6+ so I figured whatever we really liked we could order more of.  The food was WAY more than enough for 8 people.  We ended up bringing a bunch of it home.  Also, it doesn't say anywhere, but The Feast actually included dessert too!  And by dessert I mean EVERY DESSERT ON THE MENU!\n\nSome people in our group had the absinthe snuff/drink and I had the cocktail sampler which was also very good.  All in all, everyone in our party ate and drank to way excess, we had tons of left overs, and it was all for less than $100/person.  I was AMAZED at the quality and quantity of food.\n\nI will definitely return!\n\nHighlights include:\n\nSteak tartar\nParmesan paprika popcorn\nOnion soup shooter\nBurrata\nTuna tacos\nOysters\nCeviche\nLobster mac n' cheese"
1,"Good atmosphere, cool lighting, good sound system.  \n\nDrinks are expensive, but there's a two drink minimum - might as well pay the $3 more for the souvenir glass.  Food is expensive also, but it's decently tasty.  Some people like to wait until after to grab food somewhere else.  \n\nThe tables are arranged in a fashion to fit as many people as possible, so ergonomics was not really taken into account - I was twisting back to see the comedian the whole time.\n\nStill gets 4 stars because it was a nice venue for a comedy show."
1,Amazing Hawaiian Food
1,"Out of all the Sprouts locations I've visited, this one seems the most spacious, with very well organized aisles. The produce when I went was very fresh, and you can always get a great deal on groceries at any of the locations.\n\nP.S. Hatch chiles are back in season! 99 cents per pound. : )"
0,"My wife and I have eaten here more than a few times since they've opened.  They went from pretty good to awful.  It's gone downhill to the point where it is easily one of the worst Vietnamese restaurants I have ever eaten at.  The last few times has bordered on inedible.  The owner is stretching himself too thin and opening too many locations.  They do not have a Vietnamese kitchen staff, the waitress told us they are of another country (not Asian), do not speak the language and will not listen to instruction.  It shows in the food, it's erratic, inconsistent and mostly just terrible.  Stick to sushi and drinks and you are probably ok but don't order anything off the menu or you'll be really sorry.  If you drive a bit further to their other restaurant Pho Kim 88, it is much better.  Well, at least I haven't had a bad meal there yet."
0,"Having lived for 3 years in the Silicon Valley, home to some of the best Indian/Pakistani food I've ever had, finding a good local restaurant is always a high priority.  Tonight we tried Maharani.\n\nWhen I crave Indian food, it's not about the ambiance or the service.  It's all about curries, rice, naan and spices.  While Maharani is a decent restaurant, its food is nothing special.  I ordered my usual round of chicken tikka masala, mutter paneer and veggie samosas.  The samosas were crispy but the filling was very pasty and far too pureed.  I could barely finish my serving of mutter paneer; it was extremely earthy tasting and the paneer quite bland.  That said, the chicken tikka masala was pretty enjoyable and had a wonderfully rich tomato curry sauce.\n\nWould I eat here again if I'm in the area?  Only if Meskerem isn't open.  Time to find a better Indian place, I'm afraid."
1,"I stayed here this past weekend. My girlfriend wanted to stay here because of all the pink everywhere and the flamingos. I was skeptical but thought we would give it a try. How much time do you really spend in the room though in vegas? \n\nUpon arrival the hotel was nice, it does have an older feel to it especially compares to the cosmopolitan or Caesars right across the street. But it didn't look dirty or run down. The checkin line was a little slow, there was only 3 people checking in. We did try to check in at 9am though which may have been why. The lady at the front desk told us there were no rooms available but to try and come back at noon because the early check in fee is only $30 from 12-4. The actual check in process was pretty quick. I think the daily fee was $22 a day. Which included 2 people to use the weight room a day, a $20/day room credit that can be used at the hotel bars or restaurants which was nice and we used it everyday.\n\nWe booked the standard room with a king size bed. The room was pretty nice. Dark wood floors. Flat screen tv. Bright pink curtains. The bathroom was not comparable at all. It was old looking and def needed an updating. Our view was of the pool and the back end of the hotel. Not a terrible view but it wasn't the strip view. The bed was pretty comfortable. There's no comforter just sheets with a thin blanket and a pink furry piece of fabric which was probably for decoration. The ac kept the room cool and comfortable. There are small glass cups in the room which hold almost no liquid. What I did was get water cups by the pool which are in clear solo cups and just brought those back to the room. \n\nWe heard that the pool was one of the best free pools on the strip. If you plan on getting a lounge chair you need to get there at 8am when they open. People line up before 8 and the chairs go pretty fast. We brought our own towels but they do supply you with pool towels. The drinks are expensive but what do you expect? A bucket of 5 beers is $35. They also have specialty pink refillable cups that you can get frozen or mixed drinks in. I forget exactly the price but I think they were $26 and the refills $19 but I may be wrong. Your not allowed to bring in your own alcohol but they really didn't search the specialty cups so try if you like. The dj went on around noon which is also when it started to get a decent sized crowd. The dj played a mix of music so it was nice not to hear just one genre. Over the pool was pretty awesome as long as you can get over the prices for drinks. The palm trees, rock grotto and waterfall were very nice to be around. \n\nCheck out is absolutely terrible. 11am is a norm time but the elevators to go down suck. I don't just mean over crowded but over crowded to the point where you have to wait a long time just to get space. We ended up taking a elevator up to the  the top floor and riding that down to the first floor only after it stopped at every floor which was packed with people trying to get down. The stairs are an option but once you hit the first floor you have to do some employee hallway maneuvering to actually get out to the lobby.  \n\nTaxi stands go by pretty quick. There's also a shuttle that goes to the airport not sure what the price is. Also if you don't want to walk down the strip  use the hotel taxi stands to get a cab. They won't pick you up on the strip curb. Not are they allowed to have more than 5 passengers. And the drivers won't break that rule. We tried several times since we are from chicago and they let you jam 10 people in a 5 person car. They apparantly can lose their license if they have 1 too man people. \n\nOverall the hotel is nice and location is great. Hope this helps anyone."
0,"So I have been at both the DT and the North Las Vegas local. \n\nThere are a couple of things that are really good---the chips are awesome, the shrimp wrapped in bacon (leave the sauce off) and the  coffee are fabulous! \n\nThe rest is the same as throwing a Patio dinner in the microwave. Tamales...I hear they are good but I was not taking any chances. The service is also hit or miss. \n\nIf this is the only option...stay home"
1,I bought some stuff at lingerie for my girl friend and she loved and so did I ;)
0,Went in after along day of work to get a good pizza.. After watching the employees eat food with their fingers and not washing their hands after turned me off.. But thats not it..they had their own drinks on the same counter where the pizza crust lays..who knows what is on the bottom of those cups.. Dont even want to give them a star..so gross waste of 25 dollars cause we threw the pizza  away..
1,The employees were super helpful and friendly at this location inside the Fremont Hotel on Fremont Street. We purchased 3 caramel apples and received the fourth for free! The employee that helped us offered to slice our apple for us so we could snack on it while we walked around Fremont.
1,"If you are ever in Montreal you have come here for a smoked meat sandwich. Smoked meat is Montreal's version of pastrami and it is amazing, so tender and flavorful w/ a smear of their hot mustard. We planned to split a sandwich to save room to grab a small bite somewhere else but after the smells got to us we each got a sandwich & split a side of fries w/ a pickle. It was more than enough to fill us up. We will be back again during our annual trip to visit friends."
0,"i made a reservation for this hotel for november through expedia with a \""pay at check in option\"". i then noted, on my canadian credit card, that I had been charged for a portion of the hotel stay! I contacted expedia to find out why I got charged, and they were not sure as to why that would have occurred. I was extremely disappointed with this action occurring and decided to book at another hotel as I felt deceived by the \""pay at check in option\"". With cancelling my reservation, I did receive a refund from Trump, but it was less than what I was charged leaving ME out of money! \nI contacted Trump to find out why and they said there was nothing i could do as they always charge for one night and if that was not clear on expedia, that was not their problem. As well, they explained the difference in funds may be due to the exchange rate. They were not willing to refund me the difference from the charge and felt that it was ultimately my issue with booking with them and using a canadian credit card. \nI am so disappointed with this situation and how an international traveller would be treated and the lack of accountability taken by Trump hotels in the matter of having payment options listed on on expedia and what they actually do in reality. \nWill I ever stay there? Unlikely as they are not customer focused, even for those guests who may become regular Trump hotel clients."
1,"I am reading the reviews and surprised at some of them. I have been going here for about 2 years and really like it. A big plus is that it is in the mall. The food always tastes fresh and I was told they make mostly from scratch, which is a plus for me. I love the guacamole they make it at your table for you. The salsa and chips are so good, the best I have honestly tried in a restaurant. You can get them to go for around 8.00 for a huge bag and probably at least a pint of salsa. I always order the soup and guac. My hubby has had many things on the menu and always is satisfied. This is the only mexican restaurant my son goes to, he loves it."
1,"The atmosphere is cozy, hip, fun but don't expect a table for two--and you may hear conversations that you don't want to--next to us a woman had just experienced her first 'anal exam'--i'm not even making this up.\n\nOur server was warm, knowledgeable and welcoming.  \n\nThe food is TINY and amazingly delicious--Tapas, right?  well, I guess so--I just think every dish is probably about 10% priced over what each dish should be, 20% in some cases.  \n\nBut that Sangria (red) calls my name--If only, like my favorite place in San Diego, it had the pieces of fruit floating in the pitcher/glass...  Still, *by far* the best Sangria I've had locally--Unless I count my own.  \n\nI am torn between rating this place a 3 or a 4--We spent 65 dollars (plus tip) and could have easily spent 20 more for just the 2 of us, we went away not really full but the food quality and taste and service was great--then again, the seating was cramped and outside would have been more tolerable with just an oscillating fan.  still, we did have to listen to the lady's first anal exam-experience.  (In some company this wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing...)\n\nokay, Lola, you're getting your 4 because the Sangria/Service/Quality are just that good!"
1,My wife and I ordered the two lunch menu's and absolutely loved the food. My Sandwich and Soup were absolutely amazing and my wife loved the quiche.\n\nI would highly recommend this place for the food. It's also right next to the Notre Dame Basilica which makes it a good stop when touring the old town.
0,"Dear Pink's,\n\n  I hate you.  I had one in LA and it was ok but I was hoping for better...I'm not sure why I thought it would be better.  I think it's similar to when you see a McD's ad and you hope your burger looks like the ad but it's the same pile of crap every time.\n\n  The chili was bland and the hot dog was not as good as Nathan's hot dogs.\n\n  I'm pretty sure the chili dog meal looked the same entering and exiting my body!"
1,"The best cheese steaks I have ever had and in Arizona no less.  The employees are always super friendly and cheerful. Which is impressive for how busy they are always ( a sure sign they are awesome ).  They have everything from authentic cheese steaks ( yes with cheese whiz)  to customized ones of your choosing.  If you don't like cheese whiz ( for shame ) just order it with \""real\"" cheese.  I have had the chicken and steak sandwiches and they are both fantastic.  When you go try the Pizza Steak with mozzarella,mushrooms and pepperonis (it's heaven on a bun) with a side of sweet potato fries you won't regret it."
1,"I've never been to Dim Sum in Vegas, but we tried this place based on online reviews.  It's hidden in the back area of the Gold Coast casino and when we walked up to it, there was a line of about 20 people in line which was a good sign.  We were a large party (12 people) and it took about 30 minutes to get seated.  There were lots of chinese people here which again was a good sign.  Once we sat down, it was on.\n\nThe quality of the dim sum was pretty high.  The dim sum dishes were all fresh.  I would consider them to be in the upper echelon if we moved this place to the Bay Area.  Would I go back?  Probably.  Prices were reasonable, food was good and it was authentic."
0,"Absolutely worst hotel experience ever.  I tried to work out a deal so that I could move to a hotel closer to my business for the week.  The hotel clerk promised me the rooms were clean.  Even though that was not my issue (although I was apprehensive about it after reading the reviews of cockroaches and bedbugs), he persisted that I can't do anything because the rooms were clean.  \n\nThere were baseboards falling off, behind the toilet was dirty, the room was LOUD  I could here people coming and going all night and early morning.  \n\nI decided to suck it up since I already paid for the room and they would not budge.  The first night I could hear the walls crawling, not a good nights sleep.  The second night I came back to the room to find a cockroach the size of my thumb, belly up the in the middle of the room.  \n\nI checked out first thing the next morning.  The morning clerk did not seem phased about this at all and joked about the bugs being big enough to carry my luggage to my car.  Now they are proceeding to fight me about a refund, swearing the rooms are clean (how about that customer service)."
1,"We were so excited to try FnB. We had a fantastic business dinner here, and reserved this place based on recommendations from friends.  We weren't disappointed.\n\nThe appetizer salad we had was a combination of  watermelon, cucumbers, pine nuts, corn nuts, feta, cilantro, with a very light vinagrette. It sounded bizarre, but it totally worked.\n\nThe lamb manti, though, was transcending. All I can say is that it's over the moon fantastic. We all loved it. Imagine small little lamb packets topped with a light cream, and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds. Amazing. \n\nI had the pasta with heirloom tomatoes, and wow, the pasta was done right. The tomatoes were also divine, super sweet, and full of flavor. Amazing olive oil as well, I could have had a few more bites of just the oil and bread. Or twenty.\n\nMy husband had the hailbut, and it was perfection. Perfectly well cooked without being dry. The only thing I would have liked more was....more.\n\nThe wait staff was top notch, highly professional and very courteous. This is always a test for me. I loved each of their manners.\n\nCan't wait to go back to this wonderful gastro pub!"
1,"I stopped by here today with my fianc\u00e9 for a quick slice of pizza for myself.  I had noticed this pizza place before and had wanted to try it but never really had the chance before today.  Inside it looked like your normal pizzeria with a counter to order from, a pop cooler, a display dessert case and a pinball machine which was sadly not on. The temperature inside was pleasant as the air conditioner was set to 66 which was a good change from the stickiness outside.  We were greeted almost immediately on entering and I ordered a plain slice.  A few minutes later we were on our way with my slice of pizza.  I was happy to feel that the box was actually hot and so the slice was properly warmed.  Upon opening it I was also pleased to see that the slice was pretty large.  The pizza itself ended up being really solid.  On it there was a good covering of good tasting cheese which did not fall off the pizza when eating.  The crust was crispy and of medium thickness which meant the slice wasn't floppy.  Finally my favorite part was the sauce which had some good flavor to it.  As a matter of a fact you could see the spices when looking at it closely.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would eat here again in the future.  I liked the pizza that I had here and may even order a whole one in the future."
1,"This place is tops.  We've had two kids go through college at UICC over a span of seven years, so know the area accommodations well.  The staff change periodically, but the Champaign Hampton Inn has been a model for excellent, friendly, responsive service. The rooms are comfortable and well-maintained, the free breakfasts are very good (and convenient), and the location could hardly be better.  The price is reasonable; you can sometimes pay less, but the quality is unmatched.\n\nOur experience here has led us when travelling elsewhere to always look first for\nHampton Inns; they've all been good, but this has been the best."
1,"We own two units at The Signature, a Jr. suite and a one bedroom. We rent them for vacation rentals but stay here often. We love The Signature ! Non smoking property. Well made, quiet and really beautiful."
0,"When I checked in, the front desk staff was missing.  When I checked out, the front desk staff was missing.  The valets had to be chased down every single time I needed to park or retrieve the car.  When I called a week later regarding the charges on my account, the first call was disconnected.  On the second call, I was put on hold for ten minutes before I gave up.  On the THIRD call, I asked the clerk to email me a copy of a form, and she informed me that the scanner was down and she would be unable to for several days.\n\nThe pillows were appalling and there was no complimentary breakfast and no refrigerator.\n\nDoes ANYBODY run the show here??  What a disgrace to the Marriott name."
0,"We decided to check this place out a few months ago. The concept of the restaurant is very cool (although surprisingly, they are not affiliated with Apple..I wonder how that's legal). Anyhow, the fact that you can order your food on a touch screen at your table is wonderful. However, the food, although kind of pricey, is really not that great. Ok burgers, ok fries, ok salad. Nothing too exciting (nothing.. not even the fois gras burger........). I wouldn't really go back, but it's interesting to see the whole touchscreen menu thing.."
1,"Jackpot baby! Any time we have guests in town, we set aside AT LEAST 1 meal to come here. Never disappoints. I love the cheese stuffed bacon burger and chandler street tacos. My wife ordered the Ricky Ricardo once and I ate half of it and had to come back the next day to get a full one on my own. Have not had one bad meal or even an average one. Of course it helps to wash all the delicious grub down with any of the mouth watering brews on tap. Mmm... Epicenter."
1,"Saw great reviews on Yelp, so we thought we'd give it a try for dinner.  We had such a great experience we went back the next day for breakfast and then had dinner later that day as well.  We were seated on the patio in each case with a very short wait (we were early for dinner).  The atmosphere and service was excellent and pricing was very reasonable in each case.\n\nWe started our first dinner by sharing the Frisee and Kale salad.  Flavors were outstanding with a poached egg highlight.  I rarely order steak, but my steak bordelaise was excellent (thin cut, but tender) and my wife's hanger steak with merlot butter was tender and very flavorful.  The potato chip/fries on both entrees were salty and crispy.\n\nFor breakfast I had the turkey & egg white omelette and my wife had eggs benedict and both were excellent.\n\nWe started our second dinner by sharing the duck confit.  It was a generous helping with dark, tender meat accented with balsamic cherries.  This paired with the baguette bread could have been a meal itself.  For my entree, I have the lamb shank (large and again awesome) and my wife had the sea scallops.  The scallops were melt in your mouth and the brussel sprouts were the best she's ever had.\n\nAll great experiences. We know where we'll be going again the next time we're in Vegas."
1,"Woah, talk about awesome.  Ever wonder what riding in class five rapids would be like?  Well, go on this.  In no way will you stay dry, but in no way does that take away from the experience.  \n\nIncredible and a must for anyone who likes water, boating, rafting, adventure..."
1,Dr. AGNEW IS THE BEST !!!  SHE is very knowlegble and compassionate.  Staff is accommodating .  Helpful and very friendly.  Been coming here for 7 years.. wouldnt think of going anywhere else.
1,Good old fashioned Italian family restaurant.
0,"Two stars because the prices aren't too high, but the quality of food is pretty low. I got the Garden Scramble and a coffee. The potatoes in the scramble tasted like old leftover French fries, the toast was dried out and not even as good as toasting your own generic grocery brand bread, the fruit was lower quality than the stuff they serve on airlines, and the coffee tasted like water. The price of the scramble was $12, but comes with the fruit and toast so I can live with it, but the water coffee was $4.50. I should have just gone to Starbucks next door :( Can't recommend this place..."
1,"This is the best place for subs! The ingredients are always fresh and the portions are great. I've had a variety of subs and have never been disappointed! The staff is super friendly and fast. Great atmosphere, great people, great food. Definitely a win."
1,"A pretty good spot if you are in the mood for some Mediterranean food in Downtown Summerlin. The location is bright and airy, and has an outdoor seating area as well. Everything is made to order, so after you place your order, you'll get a table number and your meal will be brought to you. All in all, it took perhaps 10 minutes.\n\nThe pitas are served with an order of fries, which aren't really that necessary or remarkable. I actually wished that I could order my pita separately, as with the fries the cost was $8.99. (if they had an option for gyro-only for about $6.50, that would be perfect!).  There were large chunks of meat, feta cheese, olives, and cucumber within. It was very tasty, but be careful of those big meat chunks! Although tender enough, I almost choked on one because of the size.\n\nThe restaurant itself was pleasant, but I wasn't crazy about the fact that the bathrooms are located right next to the trash cans, in a small corridor, and they were 1-stall rest rooms. I can see that at busy times, there might be quite a line. They also were already showing signs of use and could have been better maintained. \n\nAll in all, it was a good dining experience, so I hope that they do well!"
0,CLOSED?  Well that gets a 1 star. Maybe with enough low ratings it will move out of the #1 spot....
1,I would eat here everyday if I could! A great place to share some small plates with friends and they also have a decent beer selection. Fried pickles are on point!  Perfect atmosphere and always great service. I would recommend this place to anyone. I always take family and friends here when they're in town.
0,"So - I've waited to write this review until I had tasted a fair number of items from this bakery near our house.  At this point - I've got enough to give my assessment.  \n\nThe good: their brownies are pretty decent and I've served them at a party with good success.  \n\nThe average: Their cookies are so-so.  I've had better for less money.  Specifically, the sugar cookies are too hard on the outside compared to how soft they are on the inside and the other cookies I tasted were all far too sweet.  \n\nThe bad:  Lastly - the cupcakes (which is what we all care about).  They're average.  The salted caramel is the best I've had of their flavors (and yes, I've pretty much tasted them all).  The salty peanut butter caramel one would be good - but twice when we've tried it, the pretzels on top have been stale (which is gross).  The vanilla is ok, but really too sweet and not enough 'vanilla' flavor.  And the double chocolate is good, but again... not great.  Most of their icings are too sweet and sugary tasting.  \n\nNothing I've had there is terrible - but nothing blew me away considering how many good bakeries there are in town.  I'm sticking with Simply Sweets for my cupcake and cake orders for parties... and we will support some of the other local bakeries for our 'impulse' dessert cravings!"
1,"Flat Top Grill is a new build your own stir-fry establishment located in the renovated Hilldale area. (It's across from the Great Dane)  I have quite a few picky-eater friends who fear anything spicy or \""not a hamburger,\"" so I'm glad that a place like this exists so we can both find something that registers on our own levels of \""risk taking.\"" The set up is as follows, you sit down, possibly order drinks/appetizers, and then are sent to an area that resembles a salad bar.  You choose whether you want rice or noodles, and then you can pile on as much vegetables as your little bowl can handle.  There is a variety of sauces at the end and tasting cups so you can have a vague idea what your meal is going to taste like.  The sauces give a shout out to most Asian cuisine, but I cannot attest to their authenticity. (Chinese, Thai, Korean, Japanese, etc.) After you chose your starch, your veggies, and your meat, you can choose whether to have your meal with flat bread, seafood added, tofu added, stir fried, made into a salad, or made into a soup. (There are probably more choices, I just can't remember them.)  Additionally, you have an option to indicate that you have a food allergy so your food is placed on a separate clean grill.  Additionally you can make this an all you can eat event for $1-$1.50 more, but then you pay extra to take any food home.\nFor vegetarians, there is EVERY KIND, of fake meat available on the bar.  However, during busy times, vegetarians, no one seems to  gives a damn if the beef in the protein area accidentally slips into sauces that border that side, so if you're a rigid vegetarian, be weary.  My dining companion wished that he had indicated he had a food allergy because he insisted he could taste the sauces I put on my food on his food. I also want to add, on the night that we went, our service was not good, and we saw at least one other patron expressing her dissatisfaction with the service with the manager. We managed to have a pleasant dining experience despite this, and I'm crediting the poor service to the fact that it's a new restaurant and they may still working out the kinks.\nWe both enjoyed our meals and are considering coming back at a later date to do the all you can eat option just so we could experiment a little more with different concoctions. I wouldn't say this is fine dining/cuisine at all, but it is a place you can take people with a variety of likes and dislikes. (3.5 stars!)"
1,"Stopped in when I broke a nail and my regular place was closed already. \n\nGreat repair, great conversation and it was done very quickly. \n\nIf my regular place is ever closed again I will certainly visit NY Nails again."
0,"SMALL dance floor and everyone was smushed together (but at least they looked like they were having a good time).  Music was pretty good (mostly Top 40 hits).  They had $3 mixed drink specials until midnight.  This spot definitely attracts a younger crowd though (and by younger, I mean 18-21 range).  \n\nBartender could not hear me and gave me the wrong drink twice.  (Might be language barrier or the loud music).  We did not stay long here since everyone was probably 4-5 years younger than us and we weren't enthusiastic about joining what we will call \""The Sweat Pit.\""\n\nNo fee for us to enter and they barely checked my ID."
0,"I was disappointed by this restaurant.  I like crab and crab-cakes especially.  I order four mini-crab cakes for $8.95.  They were the size of QUARTERS. It was an insult.  They tasted OK.\nI also ordered the calamari.  I tasted more batter than calamari.\nI also ordered the crab soup.  The soup lacked in crab flavor. It had a good blend of vegggies, but really lacked a seafood flavor."
1,"Great Venue | Big DJs \n$$\n\nI've been to a few clubs in San Francisco, San Jose, and bar hopped/danced in downtown San Luis Obispo. This was my first time experiencing a Vegas club, and it really wasn't that bad at all. \n\nThe venue itself is absolutely gorgeous, which I would expect since it is Vegas. Both indoor and outdoor, but the time I went didn't allow people to use the pool at night. (This is May) The lights and decor were great and it was pretty spacious, but when there's a lot of people, it gets packed fast. People tend to roll in around 10:30 - 12am. \n\nI went to see Morgan Page, but he was considered the guest to headliner Ryan Lewis. So, I went thinking that Morgan Page was performing first as opener... NOPE. Heard the opener (someone else) for a good 1 - 2 hours. He was okay, nothing special, and his set started off playing more electronic/trance beats and then gradually went into some hip-hop mixes. Ryan Lewis came on around 1am and at this point I was not feelin' it. Didn't care for him. WE LEFT. And I was so bummed that I would have to wait for Morgan Page to come on around 2:30 or later in the morning.... \n\n(We didn't want to stick around for the entire night because we drove 10 hours earlier to Vegas and we had to get up early the next morning to be in the hot sun climbing rocks outside...)\n\nWe didn't order any drinks, so I was pretty sober the entire night. Just wanted to see Morgan Page. It was quite interesting to observe people at the club though. Best way to put it: everyone is dressing to impress, which reminds me of those birds on National Geographic dancing to attract attention / a potential mate. hah!\n\nOverall, excellent venue apart from my experience."
0,"Dont EVER order from Vons Online for delivery !! I ordered groceries for delivery being that as you guys know I'm in a wheelchair and would have difficulties bringing the groceries home. I ordered with a window of 12pm to 1pm .... 2pm comes and I call customer service who reported to me that delivery was having a back up and to wait another hour.... And after many calls and e-mails ....learned that at 6:50pm they would have to reschedule? Bullshit!!\nI could have spent today outside .... instead I waited and waited and waited .... Shame on me for not cancelling the order after the first call.... And the nerve of the customer service rep telling me to have a \""great day.\""...\nWhat The Fuck?!?!?!"
1,I go with the basic wash for $6.  Gets my car pretty clean.  The vacuums do a great job sucking up the dirt on the floor mats.  I'm in and out in less than five minutes with a clean car!
0,"So they have a foursquare check-in special...and the geniuses behind the counter don't even know what foursquare is.  Nor could they find the manager for help, so everyone in my party didn't get that she gave us a $1 off instead. =bad training bad management\n\nThey also have different burgers here then their other location aka no Turkey Burger or no Buffalo Burger it was one of the 2 b/c that's all I eat. No bueno. Not happy *again*\n\nNext, this is a burger place HOW IN GOD'S great earth do you run out of KETCHUP. That's just a plain old sin! That should never happen= bad planning bad management \n\nBurgers and ketchup are like best friends. Fries and ketchup are too.  shame I say shame.\n\nBurger was OK, not life changing, probably would've been better with...you guessed it, KETCHUP!"
0,"Bad business, bad service.  The only thing keeping this place in business is their awesome volleyball set up.  Place is trashy... so is the guy whose family owns the place.  If he isn't trashed and offending customers, and employees, then he probably isn't working."
1,"I really like the pizza at Garcia's and I'd probably go more often if it didn't involve venturing onto campus or driving clear across CU.  The pizza is also usually cold (they don't seem to be getting a lot of business these days), which definitely has a negative impact on the flavor.  The prices are a bit on the high side for what you get, but not enough to be too concerned about it.\n\nBoth locations have kind of a pathetic vibe.  I know Garcia's used to be THE pizza place on campus years ago, and the restaurants definitely have that has-been thing going on that kind of makes you cringe with embarrassment for how far they've fallen."
1,"I went to Oyshi for All you can eat last week. The all you can eat menu is huge!! there is so much to choose from and everything we ate was great! The atmosphere is great, the food is delicious and fresh, and the presentation if fantastic. They also play trance music - ha!\n\nDishes I liked:\nHamachi Trio Roll\nAlaskan Roll\nDynamite (MMM)\n\nThere was a lot more but I can't remember anymore. The only one I wasn't so keen on was the cayenne albacore (this wasn't that great). \n\nfor $26 per person for dinner, this is a great deal especially because you can easily eat more than that value!"
1,"The food is good, though the burgers are a *tad* on the greasy side. I get a kid's meal and it fills me up perfectly. Staff is always nice, even when there's a rush, but there's no place to stand and wait for a take out order aside from next to the soda fountain and trash."
1,"I love the food here. This was my 4th visit. Our waiter was awesome. Good sense of humor. We used a groupon, yessss Sir. Our waiter suggested different margaritas, my bestie had strawberry & I had a Cadillac margarita. All I can say is delicious. At the end the cashier tryed to over charge me but it was taken care of. I will be back."
0,"Have been coming to Golden Canyon for at least 20 years.  The food has always been exceptional but the service has been poor at best.  Ate there again this week and the food was excellent. HOWEVER, the service was terrible!!!!!   There were only 6 people eating in the restaurant but the service was very slow, the waitress disappeared after delivering our meal, and never checked to see if everything was correct or if we were happy.  My husband gave explicit instructions about having his appetizers with his meal but she delivered it with my appetizers.\n\nThe staff were sitting around talking rather than checking on the customers and carrying on like it was a gab session.  Very poor staff training.  \n\nMy husband and I are giving it some thought as to wether or not want to return.\n\nWent there to give it one more try. Service was better than before but still mediocre at best. The Orange Chicken had very little sauce and couldn't be eaten over rice because it was so dry. Chicken was way overlooked. Had to ask several times for our wine & water.   Hubby's Lemon Chicken had very little sauce also and was dry.   Probably last time there. After all these years the place has gone downhill."
1,"ADORABLE. With Earth Day events and focus on the environment this month, I am proud to say I did my part by shopping at this store. Gift giving never felt so good. \n\nAll the lovely knicknacks are made from recycled material. They also support local artists. You can find many things for your home; from decorative lamps, prints, wall art & even vintage clothing and shoes. They even customize license plates for decoration, each letter/number is taken from an old license plate from different states. And nothing looks junky!  Finally the best part, the item is placed in a bag that is made from recycled newsprint and wrapped with ribbon from used cloth. So much thought and care, it's refreshing. If you're stuck for a gift for that person that has 'everything' then this is the place you're looking for. \n\nIt's located inside the Market place of Tivoli Village and when you're done shopping you can enjoy a snack and glass of wine at the Seasonal Menu inspired View Wine Bar on the same floor. \n\nNow that's a environmental cause I can support anyday!"
0,The buffet was huge with a ton of options but nothing I had was very good.  It was really expensive too for mediocre food.
1,One of the best Indian restaurants in Pitts! Great food !
0,I went here because Yelp reviews said it was one of the top places for Chai and Patisserie in the Plateau neighborhood. If you're coming here for the same hope of getting a good baked treat and a delicious chai you will be SORELY DISAPPOINTED. Their Chai latte was a hot mason jar of milk with a bland bag of chai tea in it. Maybe the people who suggested this place for chai are missing taste buds or had never ordered chai before. I'm a huge chai fan and so this place annoyed me to no end. Don't stick a bag of chai in a glass of nothing but hot milk and call it a chai latte. Take it off the menu. Also patisserie is not the right word for this place. The only thing they had to offer were giant chocolate chip cookies. Thanks for nothing Yelp. Hope my review saves others from walking to Cafe Neve for nothing.
1,"We were lucky enough to be here for the All Star Band (10:30 to 2:30 most nights), which I highly recommend! 11 players and guest singers that belt the blues and MoTown with power! TJ Barth is an amazing flailing blues guitarist, a terrific brass section (Sax, trump, slide trombone and a tenor sax) A key boardest with a G3 Organ and a hard driving drummer, knocking it out! Tunes were varied, but my favorite was \""Midnight Train to Georgia\"" \n\nReally mind tripping blues! \n\nThe food server was personable, fun and attentive. I nervously ordered ribs, my sexy sidekick g/f ordered fried catfish. I am happy to report we could have been in Memphis, the food was that solid. \n\nPrices were fair, no cover, and we got to keep the glasses as a souvenir. GREAT PLACE and we both hated to leave. \n\nTip : get there a bit early and sit in the padded booth stage left. Great view. Perfect stop after seeing the Beatles LOVE."
1,"The menu here has so many selections that I don't know where to start. Besides the menu, they post specials on the wall written in marker on printer paper; sometimes its difficult to see all their specials while you're seated, so you have to get up and move around. Weird, I know.\n\nI've been here twice and let me say, I am giving this place 4 stars for creativity and authenticity. You really can't find this kind of Japanese food, and if you do, its rare. My favorites out of everything I've tried would be the shabu salad, uni in ponzu sauce, and yellowtail tartar. Everything else was good, but it didn't stand out to me.\n\nI would love to come back to try their other dishes and specials. BTW this restaurant is open until really late, which is a bonus for a late-night snack."
1,"This place is pretty cool: they have a great selection of healthier foods, wines galore, and the staff is the coolest - they're the friendliest bunch of people. I guess the biggest thing here, though, is the food. They have a ton of tasty stuff that I can't usually get other places (Orangina!). \n\nThe only downside to this place is that it's kinda pricey. The other day I got enough food for a small family barbeque (a bottle of soda, some carne asada and pollo asado, salad fixings, chips, dip) and spent like $50. I bought the same stuff at the Fresh and Easy the other day and spent like $30."
1,"After an eventful first day in Las Vegas; a day where everything that was planned seemed to fall by the wayside due to timing, Brand Steakhouse saved the day.\n\nAfter our original dinner reservations at PRIME fell through due to timing, we decided to give the Brand Steakhouse downstairs a try.  Despite many reviews talking about the lack of quality restaurants within the Monte Carlo and they do not recommend this place, I decided to heed the advice of one my co-workers and give the place a try.  We originally made reservations for 6:45 but decided to pop down around 6 to see if anything was available beforehand.  I am glad we did because the place was relatively empty and we were seated immediately which saved us time and allowed us to not rush as much to ensure we made our show on time.  \n\nOur server John was great, real down to earth, helpful in making suggestions and telling us of the specials for the evening and staying on top of everything.  We aren't drinkers so they quickly ushered away our unused wine glasses and our iced teas and water came out quickly.  Being as this was not the intended restaurant I went in with no knowledge of the menu but quickly settled on the 8oz. Filet Mignon (cooked well done) and a loaded baked potato on the side.  Yes; I know, well done and Filet do not go together but I don't like the pink and bloody steaks and am often told my steak more resembles a hockey puck or shoe leather as opposed to actual meat.  Well rest assured, Brand cooked the steak well done and it was still full of flavor and absolute perfect for my liking.  This to me is the surefire sign of a good restaurant, being able to adapt to a customers wishes and still deliver a great product.  I know a few other restaurants who could learn a thing or two from this place.  Both the steak and potato were delicious and quickly devoured.\n\nMy wife, who tends to eat much lighter and healthier than I, went with the crispy chicken.  This came sitting atop a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and she seemed to also really enjoy the dish.  We decided to go with the New York Cheesecake with berry compote for dessert.  This was quite a large slice for the price and being as we were sharing it, the size was quite adequate to close out the meal.  The food, service and ambiance were all amazing and for the price this place would be hard to beat on the strip.  For 2 meals, 2 drinks and dessert our bill was $113 bucks and after a generous tip we got out having spent significantly less than we would had if our original plans did not fall through.  I would definitely recommend this place and would love to come back here again."
0,"Very disappointed. If you frozen food (except the eggs) heated up, boxed pancakes and waffles. This is the place for you. Save a few dollars and go to Denny's or IHOP\n\nService Good, and Fast only reason I gave it 2 stars."
0,"This place has a really nice atmosphere, several good Italian beers on tap and a wonderful wine selection.   \n\nThe problem is I have eaten here four times in two years. The two times I had seafood with the pasta I got sick. Like almost food poisoning sick. \n\nNormally I would not have gone back after the first time but my wife loves the atmosphere here. So after 6 months or so I would give in and give La Stalla another try. The seafood appetizer did not sit well with her this last time so we won't be going back again for another try in 6 months. \n\nThis place is busy when the resort is full and not so busy other times so maybe we were just unlucky and got some old seafood.  The problem I had with the non-seafood dishes I tried is that they were just OK and you can get just OK Italian food in Chandler at several other places for 1/2 what this place charges.\n\nWe had excellent service 3 times and rude service once."
1,"We stayed at a two queen room in the north tower\n\n[+] asked for a room upgrade during labor day weekend and we actually got it! from south tower to north tower, no extra cost either so yay!\n[+] the room was pretty spacious\n[+] Paris is attached and is right next door\n[+] in the middle of the strip so it's a pretty nice place to be\n\n[-] casino is on the smaller side\n[-] faaaaaar walk to the pool\n\nI would love to stay at Bally's again!"
0,"This restaurant is in an awesome location. A group of five of us decided to eat there because the happy hour menu seemed really good while we were walking by. When we asked to sit at the bar they said it was full which was fine but, they refused to let us order off of the happy hour menu. Apparently sitting twenty feet from the bar makes the food disintegrate. I offered to pay full price but there was nothing even similar on the menu. The waiter seemed so irritated that I had even asked if I could order something from a different menu that he didn't decided he wasn't going to wait on our table. Half the food came 10 minutes before everyone else's food. He didn't refill anyone's drink. One of the people in our party asked for lemons which arrived 15 minutes after he asked. There are so many extraordinary restaurants in Vegas that I would never go back to this place."
0,"I will NEVER go here again. I was charged $50 for a fill! Not a new set, just a fill. Absolutely ridiculous. The job she did was decent but definitely not $50 worth! You can get better service for less elsewhere."
0,"Worst experience!  Wanted it to be good because the LA is good.  No such luck!!Would rather go to IHOP than every go back!  The service was rude and very inexperienced.  The food was brought out cold and tasteless.\nAttention: Save your money, taste buds and sanity!  The LV Griddle is a waste of space!\nPlease note: this place does not deserve the one star I was forced to give them!!!"
1,Great selection of healthy choices. Love that they have juice and pretty good options for gluten free. Love the new set up too
1,"The  people were really friendly, it wasn't expensive. Only complaint is the wait, we waited a little but, but the service over shadowed that."
1,"I love being able to do some spring cleaning and get paid for it.\n\nCleared out a majority of the dusty DVDs and some of my games for my old GameCube and the Wii.  When I say a majority I mean one of those cardboard file boxes, two large plastic totes and a slender plastic tote.  All was gone through and decent amount was given to me for nicely taken care of DVD/game collection I no longer wanted.\n\nStaff was friendly and accomodating.  Always seem to have a smile on their face.\n\nNote: if you do decide to sell items here and don't want the cash, you can get I believe 30% more if you opt for the store credit."
0,"This used to be a favorite brunch spot on the weekend. Today, the service was again very slow. The Puhle Mumari ( an eggs Benedict type dish, and always my favorite) was disappointing. The sauce was sour rather than pungent and spicy and the  mung bean patty was flat. Bummer."
0,"Probably the worst Panda Express location that I ever been to. I frequent the one on ocotillo and Arizona Abe but being late for dinner and in the vicinity of this location, thought of giving a try. They Are open until 9:30pm everyday and I went in with my kids @ 8:00pm but they already cleaned out all the dishes and cleaning the kitchen. There was a beeline of customers wanting to order food and all that left is orange chicken and some steamed veggies. I ordered steamed veggies and the person behind the counter just shoved orange chicken in my bowl and closed it shut. I told her I don't want chicken but she just ignored me. My daughter ordered white rice and she just shoved fried rice in the bowl and shut. Repeatedly told her we didn't want it but she didn't care. She was talking to other staff on Spanish joking about us while we were still ordering. Overall, a very unsavory and rude staff ruined my files dinner."
1,"I missed out on Serendipity last time I was in NYC, so when I found out there was a location at Caesar's I knew I had to try it. That was all I wanted, so I just ordered at the walk-up window- there's a restaurant side with seating as well. The frozen hot chocolate was delicious, as anticipated! My only complaint: it was a little bit gritty, possibly wasn't blended up as much as it should have been. \n\nThey had a ton of ice cream sundaes as well, which looked amazing. Next time!"
0,"Recently moved to AZ, and made an appointment with Dr. Mendelson to move history, meds and address chronic remission issues.\n\nAll I got for my dollar appointment was a $140 dollar patronizing scold,\n\nI would highly recommend finding a doctor who actually cares about his patients and their issues."
0,"Go anywhere else in the Bellagio if you want good service. We tried eating at the bar, waited over 40 minutes for 6 pieces of sushi to show up. The waitress forgot to bring our second round of drinks, we ended up cancelling the rest of our order... the food quality is overrated. The man sitting beside me left because he didn't want to suffer the same fate. Furthermore, the food service manager had nothing to say after we advised him of what had transpired. I find this unacceptable.\n\nWe travel extensively and dine frequently. I highly recommend hitting up Olives or Michael Mina if you want real food AND good service."
0,"I should've written this review ages ago! For awhile I thought that this place was pretty good, but then I got a car wash over at Octopus on University. I then realized how good of a wash I should have been getting. Since then I haven't gone back. When Mermaid has a crazy deal, it's ok for the price. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. They just don't clean the interior as well as Octopus. Every employee I've dealt with is very, very nice though."
0,"Do not go to this LA Fitness, or any other for that matter. 24 Hour is much better. This LA Fitness over promises to get you to purchase memberships and training sessions. They hard close you and tell you things that aren't true to get you to purchase their membership. I was told that I didn't need a membership to have my personal training sessions, and then a couple weeks later after I signed agreement got a notice that this wasn't true. Had to call corporate to get this reversed. I cancelled my membership a couple months later because I moved and then got billed again the following month. Called this location to get the charge reversed and they hung up on me twice while transferring me to the GM and then said that the GM wasn't available. Very shady practices here."
0,"I wish I can put no stars!!!! STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!! First they are off the airport. Second No air condition in the shuttle. Third No respect. Forth and the most important They pushed you to get their insurance which you already have through your credit card and if you don't accept it, they will find no existing damages to get money from you. Upon returning of the car the woman who inspected the car told me I have a bumper damage, I looked very careful and even took picture and there was no damage as they stated. They wrote it on their report and there is no way to make them deleted it. I wanted the manager to check on the car and show me where the damage is. He said that's not my job and he said I don't know what's going to happen later. Is it an answer from a Manager?  Please people , if you want to save yourself the hassle of dealing with people who don't have any moral fiber, don't get a car from them. They destroyed my vacation upon arrival and leaving. DON'T GO THERE even if it looks cheaper , in the end you will be totally harassed."
0,"During one of my business trips last week, I decided to try a lesson in time management and actually get to the airport on time. Not only did I succeed, I arrived early enough to grab a bite to eat so I'm not stuck with peanuts. Enter: Sauce.\n\nNot too shabby of a place for being inside an airport, I guess. I'll have to agree with a reviewer below me - the service is \""ehh\"" and they don't care about much more than taking an order. For example, it was my first time and I had a couple questions about the \""build your own pizza\"" and the guy at the cash register was less than thrilled. I ordered a glass of chardonnay and he asked me if I wanted ice... oh God. Why didn't I just turn around at that point?\n\nSo I ordered a basic pizza. It had some fancy name to it, but it was just a cheese pizza. Thin crust, minimal sauce (the irony) and not much to be remembered. So I ordered another glass of chardonnay and sucked it up. \n\nNote: The seating arrangement is awful. There are bar stools and tables and you won't find a seat for awhile because the tables seat up to 4 people, and if 1 person took that table - they won't seat you there. \n\nHowever, it is probably the best you'll get if you need to dine in at the airport - unless you want McDonalds or some crap Mexican food. The prices aren't bad (about $9 for a whole pizza and $5 for chardonnay) along with a variety of other items (pasta, salad, sandwiches, breakfast food). Maybe I just ordered the wrong stuff, but I don't see myself going back for round two."
1,"We eat here once a month or so.\n\nYes it's very busy, yes it's hard to provide 'great' service when it's busy.  But they do a good job still.\n\nGood food, good prices, we keep going back."
0,"Wife and I stayed at the palms on June 28th and decided to buy the groupon for two.  One word...DONT.  Have you ever seen the Movie Vegas Vacation?  Remember when cousin Eddie made the statement the bread pudding is extra runny tonight, well that decribes much of the entrees and Dessertat the Palms Buffet.  We had the all you can drink Beer as well, but we were so disappointed that we decided to not partake.  Only thing that was worth eating was the \""Prime Rib\"", they are kinda skimpy but just tell the guy to keep cutting.  Definately overall a thumbs down"
0,"The food here is just great. The pho and eggrolls are the best I have tasted. The only problem is the service. I've had one of the young guys twice already, and he has chosen other people before myself and family. Maybe he's bias, but how is he going to take the order of some else who was there after us. When we told him we were there first he, he still brought their good first. I'm sorry I'm not white, but this discrimination is ridiculous. Trust me we are not difficult people and we tip really well."
0,"This is typical of the overpriced diner but with neato interior design in Las Vegas. Great for groups and drunk eating if that's your bag, baby."
1,"The sole reason we went here was because of the man vs. food coverage of the fried chicken waffle. It is tucked in the middle of the casino, but you see it clearly marked on the escalator going up.\n\nThe line was out the door even when it was only 11:30am. Wanting a quick brunch, we toiled around for 30min before been called. I was actually surprised that I did not see more people ordered the fried chicken waffle, but when ours arrived, people were asking to take pictures of our food. It was HUGE. Good thing we only ordered the fried chicken waffle between the two of us or we'd be lugging doggie bags with us for rest of the afternoon.\n\nGreat place to take people who haven't been."
0,Very slow service! Sushi was just average. A little pricey for the food/service/ambiance. Probably my first & last time here.
0,"Ambience was a little odd but ok.  We ordered the pretzels with the cheese fondue to start off with.  The cheese was cold but it eventually melted with the candle under it.  The pretzels were only hot on the top of the top layer no doubt from a heat lamp.  They were cold inside.  Otherwise they had a good flavor. \n\nFor the main course I had the fried chicken.  The chicken was not worth the wait.  The French fries were burnt,  the Cole slaw was nasty, and the biscuit was cold,  although the butter was melted.  My wife had the prime rib and was not impressed either. \n\nThe 2 stars are for our waitress.  She was really nice and she can't be responsible for the menu"
0,"I waited till my third visit to write a review on Agave.   Going to Agave is probably like dating a ditzy supermodel:\n\nLooks fantastic.    \nGorgeous! inside and out, day or night.  This spot tricks you into thinking you are not in Vegas...and the patio is cute, cute, cute!\n\nVery sweet.     \nYummy desserts and margs (cucumber cilantro gets my vote).\n\nEmbarassingly slow.  \nAll three visits. This last time, we sat at 6, food arrived at 7:14.  Seriously?\n\nLacks substance.     \nEntrees are just ok, def NOT worth the pricing.  White corn chips are horrid (stick to the blue ones).\n \n\nAgave is a great spot to take someone for a drink (you will score bonus points), but eat somewhere else."
0,"Horrible dry and bad smelling burgers. Tried the Angus deluxe as well as the Grilled BBQ chicken wrap. Both were dry and tasted like foam, but smelt of rotten carcass. Mea Culpa for trying McDees..."
0,"I first of about this place from a friend who was dying to check out this frozen custard. She mentioned that Food Network had done a small segment on Luv-It and their amazing frozen custard.\n\nThe first thing I envisioned when she said they sell frozen custard on the strip was frozen custard from a Dim Sum restaurant. I thought this was odd...\n\nWe get there and I am completely wrong. It has the consistency of soft serve yogurt, but does not taste like it. We shared chocolate and I have to say, the texture and aftertaste caught me off guard. \n\nIt was a cool experience, but I won't be going back. At least I know what frozen custard is now and I won't be envisioning Dim Sum custard anymore. =)"
0,I couldn't even sit for more then 5 minute while my oil was being changed without them making me get up to try to sell me something. They even tried to sell me on some charity thing. I came to get an oil change! Also they didn't turn of my service light which was on because I needed an oil change.
0,"My husband and I got \""married\"" here on in 2010--we loved the drive-through and wonderful service.  Rev. Nature Woodall did a fabulous job of making our quick little ceremony special and we really enjoyed the non-traditional aspects of the chapel--the service was religious even for a civil ceremony which I would have passed on if given the chance...\n\nBUT the chapel never sent our marriage certificate to the recorder's office (as evidenced by my attempt to get a certified copy through the proper channels).  Now that I am trying to get insurance coverage for my husband, they are running me in circles telling me one day that I need to get it from the \""recorder's office in Clark County\"" (we obtained the license in Washoe county so that is false), the next week I was told I needed to go to \""the courthouse\"" (also false), now that they are \""searching for records in a storage unit that is not nearby\"" and want us to continue waiting to hear from them.  UNACCEPTABLE!  \n\nBottom line, they will probably take great care of you if you are spending a lot of money,  but in our case, a $50 drive-through service did not warrant proper filing of paperwork.  Obviously this is causing major problems for us after the fact: insurance, taxes, etc.  Bride and groom BEWARE!"
1,"Great food, staff and atmosphere!"
1,"Simon is best known for their fun Sunday brunches.  For $39 bucks, you can order anything off the a la carte menu (omelettes, pancakes, french toast, potatoes, candy, etc) and have full access to the buffet style offerings (sushi, shrimp, sandwiches, etc).  There is also an all you can drink mimosa or bloody mary bar (~17$).  The staff is AWESOME!  We were greeted by the BEST general manager ever, Mr. Q!  He was so friendly and accommodating.  I requested some MARIAH and next thing you know, Mariah's greatest hits is blaring from the speakers.  The restaurant is very low key and I believe they may even have themed weekends were people dress up in costume.  Honestly, you wouldn't be out of place if you showed up in your PJ's."
1,"Love this place. Inspired, creative, and beautifully prepared farm-to-table cuisine. Just got back from 2nd time here and it confirmed that the 1st dinner was no fluke. Nicely diverse menu, love the use of seasonal and organic veggies. Everything I've ordered or tasted here (Duck Three Ways entree special, Pork Osso Buco entree, various appetizers, sides & desserts) has been outstanding. Service has always been warm and attentive, even on an uber-busy Saturday night. Like the open kitchen and the whole vibe here; energetic but not too loud & hectic.  Enjoyed the 50% off Sunday Night special on Arizona wines -- surprised my out-of-town snobby parents (\""Arizona wine? That can't be any good\"") with a wonderful Keeling Schaefer Syrah. Prices are way reasonable (entrees $12-$21) for the quality and portions. A great evening out."
1,"Nice little joint you guys got here tucked away in a plaza off of East Sunset Road.\n\nI ordered the number 1 combination which consists of 6 Wings, Fries, and a Drink for 8.29 plus tax. I chose chipotle honey barbeque sauce for the wings which has a nice combination of sweet and spicy. The wings themselves has a slight breading on it which gives it more of a crunch to its crispiness.\n\nAs for the fries, SHOESTRING! I dont think I have had shoestring fries that good in a long time. If anything, I would go out on a limb and say it was even better than the wings! I can only fantasize how good their chili cheese fries might be. \n\nThey also have chicken strips, burgers, and a salad with your choice of grilled or fried chicken. \n\nNow for the downers. Their prices are bit high for your basic chicken wings. The biggest thing I think that doesnt make sense is that they dont serve you any sauces with your wings like ranch, blue cheese, etc. Of course you can have your choice of dipping sauce but only if you wanna pay extra. Also if you want veggies like celery or carrots, that is also a separate charge. WHAT? When you think of wings, you see a plate or basket full of wings, fries, veggies and dipping sauce. That right there is perfection. I can think of many other places that give you dipping sauces and veggies included with your meal or at least free when you ask for it. \n\nWith everything mentioned, mostly good and a little bit of bad, this warrants 4 stars. To the owners, if you are reading this, a little bit of sauce and veggies goes a long way."
1,"Me and my crew were hitting the late night showing of the Hangover tonight and we decided to grab dinner at Kabuki, which was a very good choice. Our group of 7 was seated near the sushi bar and our server quickly took our drink order and came back and took our app and meal orders. I had the california roll (crazy I know) and the mixed tempura appetizer, both of which were really good and not expensive at all (the food alone was ~$11). Add a drink and the tip and tax for a large group and it turned out to be a little pricy of a meal, but the restaurant has a really cool vibe and it was definitely an enjoyable experience."
1,"Fresh and healthful food make this place a go-to in my book! \n\nNeeded a quick dinner around 8pm but didn't want to eat too heavy. We decided to try zikiz. I had a salad with chicken as my protein and the zikiz dressing, which was fantastic. A light vinaigrette that was delicious and refreshing. The ingredients were fresh. My husband had a rice bowl and LOVED it. He told them just to put a little of their homemade dressing and but raved about it and said he wished he let them put more on because it was so good. You can also get wraps and hummus bowls, which I'm sure we'll try some other time. \n\nFriendly service, bright and clean restaurant, fair prices. I'll be back here for sure!"
1,Friendliest waiter I've had in a while.  Mom is in the back cooking and has been cooking for her different restaurants for 20+ years.   \n\nPho was even complimented by my picky 8 & 12 year olds.  LARGE servings of pho and also noodle dishes.
0,"Food was wrong, didn't bring drinks or refills in timely manner, lobster was served cold but they did give us dessert since they messed up the order so bad."
1,"So here's an update to my initial review for gold's gym. \nScott, the director for the personal training programs; assisted me in canceling my personal training program I had signed up for.  He was really nice,  professional,  & very timely/efficient. \nMy refund of my deposit was sent back to me as per what was told to me & there were zero issues. \nI have to say,  I'm really impressed. I know this gym doesn't have a ton of glowing reviews BUT they really deserve a billion gold stars from my perspective. \nI will definitely be referring others here. :)"
1,"For a moral lunch, I got the office a half dozen cupcakes and half dozen cookies. \n\nThe red velvet cupcake and cookies are AMAZING!!! \n\nThe salted caramel is delicious too! I didn't get to try the others, but the plates were empty in the matter of minutes (and this office doesn't care for sweets, so that says a LOT). \n\nTotally recommend their deserts here."
1,"I tell ya since this place opened up a few months ago, it's quickly moving up my list of Favorite \""watering holes\"". Although, it does get very crowded on a Friday/Saturday nights, I like my weekend breakfasts or lunches. The staff is super friendly and very cool. Nothing beats a cold beer or a shot or two at this place. Cheers!!! :-)"
1,I love this place! I always make sure to eat there whenever I'm in town. Their juices are delicious. Their Acai bowls are excellent! The staff is always very friendly! I would recommend their tuna sandwich and vegetable hummus sandwich!
0,"Friend mentioned this place on FB & since I drive past there frequently I decided to give it a try.  I would love to give it more stars because the wait staff was wonderful, friendly, fast & kept our drinks filled.  Unfortunately, a fight including \""F-Bombs\"" in the kitchen with the accompanying sounds of things being thrown as apparently some poor staff person was being verbally assaulted made us very uncomfortable.  Then my \""hand-breaded\"" chicken fried steak arrived, looked just like the frozen ones at Costco, tasted like the same brand Village Inn/Denny's/I-HOP use. The home fries were dry & inedible as were the biscuits.  Coffee was good, so was the sausage gravy, but next time I want breakfast out I will head south to Chase's Diner."
0,"This was the most horrible experience. I am an avid restaurant goer and haven't had a BAD experience in a very long time, until now. We finished our meal. Waiter never checked on us mid way.  At the end, I had to go up to the desk and ask for the check. Took us 1 hr to cash out. No Rhyme or reason - we were not a bothersome table. My family of four ate, didn't ask for anything. We told the waiter at the beginning of our order that we needed Spring Rolls at the end. We finished our meal for a good 15 minutes before I had to walk up there myself.  Why did it take us 1 hour to cash out?  Because they suck at telling us our additional to go order of an appetizer was too hard to fulfill because they are out of spring rolls.\n\nThat's just dumb. One hour to cash out. Very poor service. The food was good. Average good food. But I will never come back to Jenni Pho again. I don't care how \""creative\"" that name sounds."
0,"I'm a huge fan of Steak n Shake's happy hour which is from 2-4 am and pm on weekdays.  They have half price shakes and drinks, which is a really good deal.  Unfortunately, this particular steak n shake can't make a good milkshake.  They always taste odd here (too much syrup or poorly blended?).  I've been here at least 3 times, and they're always bad.  So, now to satisfy my cravings I tend to drive up to the prospect one.  \n\nThe food, on the other hand, is usually about your average steak n shake fare, so long as you stay away from the shakes, you might enjoy your experience (but who really would want to go to steak n shake and not get a shake?)."
0,"I have been to Different Pointe of View with my family for Easter years ago.  Last night was my first time back to the restaurant and could not have been more disappointed.  In walking into the restaurant you are greeted by a very musty, nasty smell.  The upkeep of the interior could use some work.  The view, as always, is beautiful but that is about it.  The food was mediocre but priced at fine dining prices.  Would not go back. Almost forgot, while waiting for our car I noticed the menu posted in a case outside.  The case had a Yelp sticker on it.  How tacky for a fine dining restaurant."
1,"Located on Rose Street, I popped into Rock Candy the other day for a wee nosey around. I spotted their Xen collection in the window and have a few guy friends who love this range. It's made out of stainless steel and at reasonable prices too so perfect if you have an allergy to precious metals.\n\nI also noticed their Latham and Neve collection which I love! I got a Latham and Neve love heart pebble necklace for my 18th birthday and went through a phase of wearing it every day for around two years. To be honest, I had almost forgotten about my little pebble necklace but after seeing the same one in all it's glory yesterday I'll need to dig mine out of my jewellery box. These necklaces are gorgeous and you can get them with a chunky silver chain or just a regular snake chain. They're also quite reasonable priced, between \u00a370-\u00a3120.\n\nThe shop was very organised but for me, it kind of lacked any atmosphere, there wasn't any music and even though the shop assistant said hello and asked me if I was just happy browsing I got the feeling she would have preferred if I was wearing a fur coat adorned with diamonds. In my sneakers I was left to browse which to be honest, is probably a bit better than getting the hard sale."
0,"I choose to use Yelp a lot and find other peoples reviews very informative yet also very biased at times.  I have also never taken the time to write a review until now.  So here we go...\n\nMy boyfriend and I had brunch then I suggested we go get pedicures and make a lovely day out of our Sunday.  He declined yet graciously offered to pay for me to get my toes done.  Although disappointed he didn't want to enjoy the wonderful luxuries of a pedicure and the fact that his toe nails needed it, I quickly responded with a grateful thank you. He then began to tell me about where his ex got her nails done, he apologized for bringing her up but I responded \""It's all good babe, I want to know where she went because both of you had lived in this town more than me and know the ins and outs of great places.\""  So he brings me to \""Dream Nails.\"" He praises the owner Tommy is the best, his wife, mother, all the staff are the best in Las Vegas and that he has gotten numerous pedicures from them and his ex was very happy too.  I was reluctant because it seems in this town that nail places are so hit and miss along with the technicians but I was not going to turn down a sweet gesture from my boyfriend on this lovely Sunday.  \n\nI go into the ladies room, he leaves, I pick out my color and then sit in the pedicure chair.  The water is luke warm, no biggie, it can always be warmed up.  I ask what kind of pedicures they have, the girl responds \""regular pedicure.\""  I respond \""yes and what does that include? And has he already paid for it?\"" She says \""regular pedicure with massage.\""  I ask her what's included in the spa pedicure?  She responds \""Salt scrub, foot mask and hot towel, $10 more.\""  She had no clue if he had paid already, I asked again, then she found out he had not.  I asked to pay the difference which would have totaled their \""Deluxe Pedicure\"" out at $35 which I was excited about.  I asked her to run my card now so my boyfriend wouldn't get upset.  \n\nI have her help and get in and cut out my ingrown toenails, I have to have my toe nails very short or else they hurt.  I've always been a difficult patron for pedicures because I want them so short and most technicians will not cater to what I want and then I end up butchering them later on at home because I'm in so much pain.  She does a great job getting rid of my in growns, filing them short, removing excess skin, etc.  Then the Deluxe part comes and I'm so excited... \n\nShe applies a light layer of salt scrub, massages for at most 1-2 minutes which I felt was no big deal, the main massage comes at the end with the lotion.  I don't remember if she used the razor file before or after the scrub but she was efficient.  She then applied the mask but only to part of my foot but at this point my boyfriend had returned and was talking to me about tanning packages at this salon he has went to in the past, (since I am a spray tanner only) and was going over pricing with me.  I also didn't want to come off as if I was bitching or complaining about his generosity to the girl who didn't apply much of the mask.  \n\nThen the hot towel came, it wasn't on for long, she then wrapped my toes and painted them.  She did an alright job of painting them but now that I look at them, they are not even and do not look that good.  \n\nNow to the REALLY bad part....\n\nShe filed so deep and/or too much and it now feels as if the bottoms of my feet re sunburnt,.  It hurts too much to walk right now, my feet feel so raw.  She also didn't put any lotion on my feet or legs, so my skin is very dry after being submerged in water and being scrubbed and masked.  I returned home, again, NOT WANTING to complain to my boyfriend about his nice gesture but my feet continued to hurt more and more.  I have since put ointment on the balls and toes of my feet and wrapped them in bandaids.  It hurts too much to walk right now so I am instead laying in bed, writing this review oppose to doing cardio at LVAC.  I'm pissed off.  $40 \""Deluxe Pedicure\"" with grat and my feet are dry, in pain, polish is not awesome and it has driven me to take the time and write this review not to mention the whole pedicure was only about 20 minutes.  I have had numerous pedicures in my lifetime and it seemed as though she was rushing through just to finish..  I'm sure they have had happy patrons but I am certainly not one of them, nor will return unless it's to get my money back or an apology for my painful feet."
1,"My SO and I were disappointed with dinner and wanted a good late - night  snack. He suggested  Insomnia Cookies. \n\nPros:\n-You can order ahead for later delivery!\n-They are so yummy and gooey! \n-Chocolate chunk and snicker doodle are amazing!\n-SO said peanut butter and oatmeal raisin were delicious!\n-Delivered still warm! \n-Website was super easy to navigate. \n\nCons:\n-Cookies are a little expensive at $14 for twelve cookies, but I don't plan on buying cookies every day, and they are absolutely delicious. \n\nOverall: \nWould definitely recommend and buy again! Amazing!"
0,"I was visiting a friend and decided to go on yelp saw this place with three stars.  The food tasted packaged the cut seasoned breakfast fries were tasteless n hard, food was cold and just plain no taste at all I would not return here again. The service was good.  We saw 11 people seated at a table that should have had 8, these people are paying customers n you squish them in to seat them, if I were them It would have not been acceptable."
0,"If i could leave zero stars, i would. I was in the other day and overheard Joe talking very badly about another customer, which is a very bad sign. He comes across very nice to your face, then talks about you behind your back. He is also extremely sexist - old school Italian machismo i guess. I overheard things I cannot repeat here, I couldn't believe my ears. He may be a decent men's tailor, but what a D-Bag."
0,"I'm just judging this place on the drinking atmosphere alone, but it fails. It's too hot, too crowded, and does not provide nearly enough space to breathe. On top of that, they stopped carrying Capitol Island Wheat brew, one of my favorite midwestern beers, but offered Golddigger instead. The ladies' bathrooms are hard to find and there's nothing special about the decor."

0,"Expected a bit more after the reviews, unfortunately I left dissatisfied.  \n\nMy co-worker and I had high hopes and stockpiled food accordingly.. we got a couple 2 meat plates, soda's (no beer here!!), a couple sides and added on a couple ribs as we expected them to be amazing. \n\nThe meat wasn't anything outstanding.  It had a nice smoke ring on most, but lacked the flavor needed.  They need to put some more rub or baste accordingly, because all meat was very much lacking. \n\nBrisket - tender, but possessed minimal bark and flavor.  Good consistency. \nPork - adequate taste in some bites, but overall lacking anything special. \nRibs - cooked very well, had a little tug on them as opposed to falling off the bone. But again, missing flavor. \n\nMac n Cheese - the shining star... It was great!! Had a crusty topping of goldfish or something similar.  \nHousemade Rootbeer - not very good and I really enjoy rootbeer.  Just way too sweet for me.  \n\nBbq Sauce - it was ok.  I've had better and worst.. the spicy had a nice kick to it.. I slathered it on nearly everything to flavor it up.  \n\nWish I would have went somewhere else.. but its all about giving places a shot."
1,"I finally made it here!!!!  I went with a group of 6, so we got a chef's tasting menu for $35 per head (pretty sweet deal).  I got the roasted green iced tea to start.  The food just kept coming so I hope I can remember it all.  I will have to come back with less than 5 people so I can order a la carte next time.\n\nWhen I got here, I sort of recognized the sushi chef, and he looked at me, but I could not place him.  He came out to talk to me, and remembered me from being a regular at The Ka before The Ka went waaaay downhill more than a year ago!  I was impressed.  His name is Hiro.  He was so kind and also came out to greet me before I left.\n\nBlah I know everyone has read that I don't eat pork, so I let everyone else eat the bacon-wrapped asparagus and pork cheek.  I did eat everything else though...fluke sashimi with ankimo (fish liver) and crunchy part of fish with spicy daikon, green onions, and ponzu.  Sliced thin like you see fugu sliced.  What's not to like?  Homemade tofu (like velvety cream) \""caprese\"" with seaweed and tomatoes, agedashi tofu with ikura, fish gutted at our table with daikon then the bones and head were fried and returned, skewered chicken wrapped in its skin - sooo juicy, skewered tender medium rare beef with garlic chips, nut-crusted tempura asparagus, fried chicken skin with spinach leaves and miso..the grand finale was a rice dish served in this big pot where the bottom crisped up the rice (we likey!!) with ikura, salmon flake, green onions, veggies...mmmmmm!!!  I am probably missing something.  We got hot tea at the end too.  Service was great, place is really small and intimate.  Extra points for matcha salt and shichimi togarashi on the tables!!!  I will definitely come back (who wouldn't?)"
0,"Today, I realized that I've been giving way too many five-star ratings on the last few things that I've reviewed, and I thought about \""gee, what have I been disappointed with in the last few weeks?\""\n\nHello, Andy Warhol Museum.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a graphic designer for a living, done art school, taken my requisite art history classes, and for all intents and purposes, admire Andy Warhol.\n\nBut when it comes to the museum, honestly, I was expecting more.  A lot more.  In the oddity paradigm of interests, I found myself leaving PNC Park early, because the jock team I was watching was stinking up the joint, and I thought an attempt to satiate my art-geek tendencies could salvage what was turning into a disappointing Pittsburgh trip.\n\nI went into the Warhol museum with expectations of plenty of visual stimulation, only to be relatively bored out of my wits by a generic array of materials that I could've probably found with a google search.  Aside from the what felt like a blatant attempts to try and subliminally get people to subscribe to Interview, I found very little impressive, and the \""special exhibits\"" of the evolution of the Playboy bunny and pin-up artwork was nothing more than an off-shoot wall of what appeared to be DeviantArt garbage.\n\nI've dealt with snooty art snobs all throughout my career, and maybe it's because I was wearing a baseball t-shirt and baseball cap that obviously meant I was clearly not sophisticated enough to enjoy the Warhol, but the entire staff at the museum pretty much blew me off, didn't say a word to me, except to take my money and ask what my zip code was, and were obviously too hip for a jock like me.\n\nAnd the gift shop?  It's a glorified Urban Outfitters.\n\nSorry, Dandy Andy - I love your work, but your museum stinks."

0,"When I called to upgrade from South tower to Rush the operator tried to sell me access to \""VIP\"" checkin, where I could skip \""lines\"" and would be guaranteed a king bed I had originally reserved...this for an additional $20.  Thanks, but no thanks....I looked in the VIP booth and apparently what was given out for that extra $20 was bottles of juices and water the likes you can get at wal-mart for 79 cents....at checkin at 1 pm there was no line at the main desk...a drop dead blonde with half her fake boobs exposed worked the desk...and said the room had a view of the strip....it did...sort of....you could see the south tower as well as side of another hotel and the Strat and Trump tower and Rio and Palms in the distance but almost nothing on the strip as the young model clerk stated.\n\nRoom was nice...TV was 42\"" but only had local channels and a handfull of cable...no HBO....but I saw that the cabanas in the pool area had TVs with almost 100 channels....wtf??\n\nSoon after checkin I had to get a six-pack of beer and another bag out of the car and on the way back to the room I stopped by the \""H2O\"" pool and hot tub facility, and I asked where the towel area was and a \""security\"" employee brusquely said \""not with that beer.\""  Excuse me..I did not see any signs as to what is prohibited at any entrance to this area.  I was planning to go to the H2O after I dropped my items off in the room anyway.\n \nThe next evening at 8 in the evening I returned and entered the main pool.  As I approached the fountain, this same individual I had dealt with the previous day rudely told me, \""Buddy this is closed.\""  Hotel employees do not call guests \""buddy\""; I am not his buddy and I found that offensive.  \""Sir\"" is more appropriate.  Tool may have been supposedly trying to do his job, but it was apperent he was on a power trip.   said \""I'm easy to get along with.\""  No sir, I don't know you and don't care to, and you were trying to be a horse's ass to a paying customer and guest who had spent a lot of money in rooms and other hotel facilities to that point.  He wanted me to go to the upstairs pool, but I did not want to interrupt the young girls and their Olympic training session. I specifically wanted to go in the fountain pool, away from the fustercluck of the hot tub and upstairs.    Upon exiting, I threw the towel back into the pool for douchebag to fetch.\n \nFault also lies with the hotel.  Again, I did not see signs at any point of entry in the H2O area indicating this area was closed nor for items that were prohibited or other rules, and if there were or had I seen any I would have abided by these. Also, barricades would have been helpful if the hotel was to discourage anyone from entering that pool at that time.  This affected my stay at the Golden Nugget adversely and because of this KGB agent wannabe's rude actions, I did not enjoy my stay.  I ceased spending any money at any of the hotel's facilities from that point."

0,"So the OWNER of West Liberty Beer and Tobacco threatened to kick my ass today at his store... Long store short I was returning a keg a friend of mine got from for his wedding and the store did not offer him the proper tap. I tried to return the untapped keg and the Owner knew of the situation and told me he would only give me $30 deposit. He said the beer is probably spoiled and he cant take it. I called him out on his bullshit that storing the keg at 60 degrees would not \""spoil\"" it but he wouldn't even let me speak and kept interrupting and answering calls. So of course after being so rude certain choice words were exchanged. I asked to speak with a manager and he said \"" I am the motherfucking owner!\"" So I gave up, realizing this guy was the biggest jackass I ever met so I started wheeling the keg back out to my car on the dolly and i finally told him to fuck off and he ran over and tried grabbing the dolly off me and said \"" You cant use my dolly now!\"" After getting the keg in my car as we are still arguing I said \""I never met a motherfucking owner like you in my entire life!\"" He put his chest to mine and put his finger in my face and said \""call me that one more time and Ill beat ur ass right here\"" Of course i did call him it several more times and he stormed off. Really thought he was gonna hit me though. Unbelievable that people like this own businesses and conduct them self in such a poor manner! BOYCOTT WEST LIBERTY BEER AND TOBACCO!!"
0,"I was looking forward to a meal at the 41 but I was quite disappointed. The space is comfortable and nicely decorated. However, the food and service did not meet our expectations - particularly based on the prices. The first problem we had was that the first three bottles of wine we ordered were sold out. This left us only with very high priced wine available to order. After some discussion the Maitre D' offered us one of these bottles at a lower price to compensate. This was appreciated and was a nice touch.\n\nThe food was unremarkable. I had the burger and fries which was fine but could have used a flavour punch. My friend had the chicken \""Kiev\"" which was very disappointing. We ordered the cheese platter and the creme brule for dessert. The creme brule was very small and lacked in flavour while the cheese plate did not have a great selection.\n\nThe service was very slow and inattentive. We had to request water and were often looking for the server's attention - to order and to pay."
1,"We wanted a snack before we get buffet later on that night so we stumbled upon here\n\n[+] we got samples of the chicken tenders and boy, was that a good choice on their part b/c we ended up getting 20 pieces!\n[+] the chicken tenders are amazing and were actually tender!\n[+] ordered 20 pieces and we got around 24 pieces\n\nThe chicken was pretty delicious and if we're ever around the area, we'll probably get it again."
0,"I was severely underwhelmed by Suite. \n\nAfter hearing soo many great things about this club, I expected a beautiful, spacious venue with a nice mix of somewhat interesting people. Unfortunately, the club was small, cramped and the crowd left a lot to be desired. Drinks were overpriced, too. The music was just decent with a slew of 90's and early 00's hits.\n\n I'm giving two stars because it was only $6 for admission after midnight (when I arrived) -- if it were more I would give it only one. \n\nPerhaps Friday night is the wrong night to go? Who knows. I won't be going back."
1,"Caesar Palace finally stepped up to the plate and opened up the buffet up to meet their standards. We went on Opening Day (9-11-12) around 10am and we were told they hit max capacity and will re-open for lunch. We waited in line for them to re-open at 11am, but  many people were cutting in line. There was only 8 groups in front of us, the Bacchanal wasn't going to fill up...so we didn't care too much. Regular price for lunch was $21.95. We were seated in the glass room. Bacchanal transform their buffet area into three different theme room: steel, wood and glass and they were beautiful. \nThe staff and service was awesome. Even the staff that were serving us over the counter, they kept asking if we wanted anything else. They were ready to do anything. The food spread was massive, it kept going and going. There was so much food and so many cuisines to try... I end up stuffing myself and didn't try everything. \nThe food portion was serve similar to Wicked spoon with individual portion size. Even though its in individual plates, some portion was a little too much for myself.\nI started in the seafood area, we cocktail shrimp, oysters, clams, oyster shooters, then the fish- halibut and salmon grilled, chowder, crab cakes (YUM!). Asian area: dim sum, hot & sour soup, miso soup, duck, bbq pork, sesame ball, potstickers, stir fried veggies, fried rice, chow mein, orange chicken, korean bbq, grilled chicken, sushi and more...Italian area have many different types of pasta: lasagna, spaghetti,  variety of pizza, bread and cheese area, cold meat area, salads, and of course a Mexican area with tortillas, carnitas, homemade salsa, beans, and more. Carving station have lots of different types of meats: sausages, beef, ribs, turkey. I really like the hot link. Also the dessert station was awesome. They have a variety of cookies, cupcakes, cakes, pies, cheesecake, ice cream/gelato and fruit. \nAfter all the food we stuff into our stomach, we had cups of coffee. The coffee was flavorful, it wasn't like diluted water. Everything was great and so delicious. I totally would recommend this place to everyone and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas, especially for dinner to try the other seafood they will have."
0,"You know i was going to give them 2 stars at the very very beginning...Honestly i was. Why only 2 stars you are most likely wondering.  To start off to give you a little idea is that i was born and raised in the bay area for almost 22 years of my life on nothing but the most amazing Asian spots to eat at with the best flavor and all. \n     Luckily i did find a Thai spot out here in hot dry Arizona which does not happen to be Thai basil obviously.  Second off i happen to be a huge foodie and let flavors sit to get the full experience. Thai basil lacks A LOT of flavor because everything was so watered down. \n      I asked for mild panang curry and my friend ordered the mild pad thai.  i was expecting some sort of spiciness given the fact that i had asked for MILD and not  MEDIUM. I shouldn't have to order the hot to get more flavor out of it wouldn't you agree?? something in between spicy and no spice? it would make sense...but thai basil failed that miserably on the flavor aspect and spiciness lots of points missed there. \n     Now we had got there 5 min after the lunch hour meal deal had ended but we did not want huge dinner portions at the time so we had asked very politely if it was possible if we could order the lunch meal instead. The manager, I'm assuming agreed and brought us out some soup to start. The soup was not bad since we were starving at the moment and i love tofu so okay onward with my review.  Shortly after they had brought out my awaited panang curry which looked to be quite soupy and full of veggies which i do not mind. What matters the most is the consistency and flavor. Which you should have an idea of how the flavor turned out but it gets worse. As i poured some curry over my rice and go to eat a spoonful i am quite used to a spoonful of curry to cover the rice with enough flavor.  This was not the case here. i had to basically pour a whole bowl of curry onto a small tiny cup of rice to get any flavor of curry over my rice. :(\n       Thai basil had screwed up my friends pad thai and brought out her piping hot plate a couple minutes later hers was not even tinted with any redness we should not need to add more hot sauce when  we asked for mild we expected mild. We were more than happy to get the lunch special than a huge dinner plate because of the fact  that we should not have to pay so much for HORRID(cleaned up word for what i would like to say) food. We were definitely complaining but don't you think  you would also if you were to see a rating of 4 stars out of five on a highly reviewed Thai place?  My other friends pad see ewe? was lacking of all flavor apparently in 85% of the dish and said the rest was bland.\n        The employees were giving us the dirty eye the rest of the time when they realized how much we hated their food. When they brought us to go boxes we didn't need i just told my friends it was pointless to pack the nastiness up when we really wouldn't be eating it later. They agreed and asked for to go cups for our thai tea instead the employee came back and slammed the cups down and walked away continuing to give us dirty looks. TERRIFIC. So freaking what if we dont like your disgusting food. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. and this was 3 reviews in one. \n\n        We did NOT leave a tip because the employees were not helpful or considerate since we did not enjoy their food in the slightest. it was not worth my 10 dollars because i ended up having the worst stomach pain for 12 hours straight and bubble guts for probably a good 7-8 hours in the beginning. gross, i know.  I would like to give them another chance but after my 12 hour long incident i really don't want to risk it. I will continue to go to my beloved thai rama when they are open that has to suffice until i go back to the real deal in San Francisco, Milpitas, San Jose or Tracy, CA."
1,"Good show. Props fantastik. Too short,only about an hour."
1,"My three favorite things about entering a Great Harvest are: the warm greeting on initial entrance, the delicious smell lofting in the air, and the thick slice of fresh bread offered at the counter. \n\nThe way Great Harvest prepares their breads is one of the reasons why it is worth every penny. When you break into any of their loaves, the bounty of ingredients is clearly visible. For sandwiches, I love to get their cheddar garlic and have them slice it up. With bread like this, it is unnecessary to add any cheese to the sandwich or anything besides protein and veggies. I could make a meal out of it on it's own. Then follow it with some of their Sin Amen Swirl."
0,waitress's attitude is awful and they let you queue for long time though they are not busy and the restaurant has empty seats.
1,"Partner and I ate here while staying at the Wynn - Encore. We walked in around 630-700 (first come first serve kind of place) and was able to get a table after about a 30 min wait. We shared the duck appetizer which was good. He had the duck and I had the walnut prawns. Both dishes were quite good. Great food, good service, and not super expensive. The tables are a little too close together for my taste but I am sure we could have found a more intimate setting in another restaurant as this is a semi-casual dining option."
1,"Hidden gem of some really good sushi in Vegas.\n\nI was upset beacuse I thought I would never find a sushi place comparable to the Bay Area since I moved to Vegas.  But I finally found one that comes close!  I'm so happy and excited about it!\n\nMust haves:\n- Garlic Edamame...deep fried and garlicky!\n- Ebi Crunch...my favorite!\n- Something Wrong # 69..ain't nothing wrong! haha!\n- Vegas...no rice but still good\n\nI like how the sushi that does have rice, doesn't really have that much rice!  Sushi is very flavorful, and different!  Hokaido is definitely creative in their sushi creations.  I've also had the agedashi tofu, gyoza, and tempura ice cream.  Appetizers were good, but the ice cream was freezer burned on the inside of the fried shell BOO!  Also, do not order the double hamachi; it totally takes away from the Hamachi and it's way too saucy.  Just get the regular Nigiri Hamachi if you're craving it.  Freshness!\n\nBut I still give this place 5 stars!  Go now!  Fort Apache hidden gem!"
0,"Ok, now they say hotel guests get in free & they don't know who told me last year???So we paid 1000$ to stay in Cosmo last year & get nothing. This year we stay hotel 32 & get nothing."
0,"I must admit to being totally underwhelmed with our dining experience at Strip Steak, Mandalay Bay.\n\nFirstly the time between ordering and receiving our food was lengthy  although the restaurant didn't appear to be very full. When  we did receive our dinner,  nothing was piping hot. \n\nI had the chop and I think it was probably the blandest piece of meat I have ever eaten.  Totally devoid of any flavor what so ever.  My companions who both ordered the Filet Mignon, found they were  satisfactory but neither completely finished their steaks as they just weren't that good. \n \nThe duck fat fries were delicious, truffle mac and cheese was okay.  The asparagus was nice, but the mushrooms were cold.  The selection of desserts was poor although the cheese cake was very light and delicious. \n\n As I said a totally underwhelming dining experience.   Frankly I would have been disappointed if I we had eaten this meal at a steakhouse with a mid range price point but this meal cost over $400.00. \nI would recommend skipping Strip Steak if you wish to avoid being disappointed."
0,"Not a very \""customer service oriented casino.  Walked through, even said hi to some of the employees, most had no response.  I do this if employees don't acknowledge you, I figure if they don't care to even say hi, then I can find a place that does.  It just presents  a warmer atmosphere. \n\nI don't think this casino will last, I'm spending my money elsewhere."
1,"I'm giving this place four stars because my gf works here and I have to say, the burgers are decadent. \n\nI had no idea where to start, so I asked my friend for a recommendation.  She suggested that I get the kobe beef pattie and then add on as many toppings as I like.  I think my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach b/c when I got the burger, I almost passed out.  I couldn't finish the damn thing.  I chose mushrooms, cheese, spinach and jalapenos b/c I didn't think that lettuce, onions or tomatoes came with the burger.  Der, I know.  \n\nThe sweet potato fries were crispy and perfectly cut - not too thick, not too thin.  My friend ordered the $ 66 burger, which I found to be too rich for me.  But I'm just a simple girl, so what do I know, right?  Foie gras and kobe beef was not the right combo for me."
1,"We were passing through Madison on our way from Minneapolis to Milwaukee and decided to use our trusty Yelp app to find some lunch.  The old fashioned came highly recommended.  There was a few comments made about their lunch counter service.  I honestly think it made it quicker and easier to get out during lunch, so no problems here.  We were still waited on as If there had been table service. \nWe were excited to try their homemade jerky! It was excellent and only $1 a piece.  We also tried the chili...different but very good.  The meals are all very fairly priced and a lot of food for the money.  I had the spinach salad.  I highly recommend it.  The hot bacon dressing was awesome.   My husband had the shaved prime rib special.  There was not a crumb left.\nThis place was definitely worth going out of the way for.  Great view of the state Capital."
1,"As good as it gets, Jarling's Cup is a reason to move to (or stay in) CU. Delicious custard, reasonable prices, nice service, retro decor.\n\nSnowstorms are fantastic, and they have many mixable ingredients to cater to any taste. My poison is Butterfinger & peanut butter cup (an emulated cup made with peanut butter and cold fudge).\n\nTo make a night of it, start with a Delicious Seaboat(tm) fish sandwich, just two doors down from the Cup."
0,"Not great. Long lines, slow service and cr\u00eapes that essentially all have the same lemon filling (unless they got our orders completely wrong). Cheap by Vegas standards, but you get what you pay for."
0,"I have never been so dissapointed with a business. I purchased a living social vooucher for this business that included a shampoo, conditioner, hot towel treatment with scalp massage, haircut, blow dry, and style; and a 30 minute manicure and facial. You can imagine that I was quite excited to try a new salon. \n\nI called in, and they only had time to do a wash and cut. First put off. Then I had an emergency, so I called in to let them know i would be 20 minutes late or I could reschedule. \n\nThe answer I got was less than pleasant. I was told because they would be out of 20 minutes, they would only style my hair (not actually wash and cut it) and if that didn't work, they would not permit me to reschedule! They even had the nerve to ask why I was going to be late. Inappropriate much! \n\nThis is definitely the wrong way to gain new customers!"
0,My daughter wanted to go there for her birthday. Worst experience in a restaurant. Took forever to get our food. Even though I could see it on the warming shelf ready to come out. Daughters ordered ribs and the silver skin was left on them. Then for desert she ordered a slice of chees cake. It was hot on the edges and frozen in the middle. They tried to nuke it before serving it. The staff was very lack luster. Acted like they didn't want to be there. Will never go back.
0,"There was almost nothing I liked about this place, other than my friends band that was playing."
0,"It's an alright Bou to visit..... if you can find parking. I would love to know who designer the parking scheme of this place b/c um, it kinda sucks. The main entrance/exit is off East Blvd yet I have to be super aware when pulling out since I feel like I am going to hit a runner.  The spaces are tight, corners are sharp and am pissed off someone who designed this parking lot is making bukoo bucks. Enough about the parking (hopefully this little rant shows how much contempt I have for it)\n\nService is shotty-sometimes it's great, other times not so much. They have a lovely outdoor patio where you can sip on your drink which seems to be the option for me most of the time since this place is always packed to the gills with either QU students, Dilworth-ites or just plain old weird people who come out of the wood works to get in on the free Wi Fi action. The coffee and the visual aesthetics are the only things I dig about this place."
1,This was a great stadium.  I came here for The Brothers of the Sun Tour I loved it.  It sucked because it rained at the beginning but it stopped before Tim McGraw and Kenny Chesney started to preform.  I think a great enhancement for the stadium would be to put a little roof over the top seats just so it shelters you a little.   Charlotte is an awesome city and the stadium is very nice.  Im not a panthers fan so I most likely won't be coming here for a football game though.
0,"The last two times I went here for a brazilian (which I'm used to getting one every 3 weeks), and I left with a lot of pain and there was still wax left on me. I used to go to Alicia (who was awsome) and when she left they scheduled me with someone else and didn't bother to confirm with me if it was okay until I arrived. Not cool. I will no longer be going here as I have found somewhere cheaper, less painful, and with better customer service."
1,"Stayed here last weekend... location was great - so close to the strip of bars and restaurants on Carson Street. The hotel itself is very clean and our room was clean too! They also have a complimentary shuttle that runs until 11pm. The only downfall would be the staff. The daytime staff wasn't courteous to us at all and when we asked for an early check in they told us 2pm, but that didn't happen. However, the night staff - particularly Alyson - was amazing! She was so nice and did everything she could to meet our needs."
0,"Service slow. Food was partly cold and they didn't have the specials like the one my husband and I go to in Escondido, ca.  If you have a local hooters my bet is its better. Stick with that!"
1,"This is definitely the best Cantonese food in Las Vegas..  Before I thought Food Express was good, but KJ Kitchen blew me away!  Firstly, it is a lot cleaner and has a better interior.  Secondly and most importantly, the food is top notch.  They give you a \""lai tong\"" free soup as long as you ask for it and a \""tong shui\"" sweet desert soup at the end.  The deer with bean thread noodles was silky and succulent.  This place is always packed with Chinese locals and big groups, so get there early."
1,"On the way to The Farmhouse in Gilbert a couple of weeks ago, we stumbled onto Biscuits.  Being from the South, I'm always down for biscuits and gravy, so we decided to check out this cute, barn-themed restaurant.  It was a little to shiny to actually exist on a farm, but welcoming, none the less.  \nThe restaurant is very clean and open and the service was friendly.  We were sat immediately and received drink orders before we could decide on anything from the delicious looking menu.  There were definitely some good ol' southern favorites, like grits and corned beef hash, but there were also a few chorizo options and a Portuguese sausage that my boyfriend ordered.  \nI went for the corned beef hash, scrambled eggs, hash browns and added sausage gravy to my biscuit. Make sure you go hungry!  I couldn't even dream of finishing everything I ordered, but I made sure to it all.  Crispy hash browns, fluffy eggs, and big chunks of corned beef mixed with potatoes, peppers and onions.  The sausage gravy was perfectly thick, but could possibly have used a bit more sausage (what can I say, I'm a meat lover!).  The only thing that brings it down to 4 stars was the biscuit.  It was definitely good, but more bready than flaky.  More like a stirred mix than an kneaded dough with the goodness of flaky layers.  And, being their namesake, I do think that part is pretty important.  \nWe were plenty stuffed and we'll definitely go back because there aren't many places with corned beef hash that didn't come out of a can.  Also, they have good service, which is hard to come by. \nOn another note, they offer a military discount to any active or inactive duty military, which is wonderful to see because it's just something small that companies can do to give thanks to people who willingly put their lives on the line every day.  I can support that."
0,"This store is a poor excuse for a Japanese market. They have a horrible selection, the prices are beyond outrageous and the customer service is a joke. I am disappointed to learn that this is one of the few Japanese markets in town. I'll drive to Marukai/Mitsuwa in Costa Mesa, CA before I spend another dime here."
0,"For the record, I had to strongly plead with Jenny to give this theater higher than a one star rating. But please, AMC Management, if you want to thank me, do so by sending me a gift certificate to any theater but this one.\n\n$10 per ticket took me back somewhat but the tone of this [arguably] two star experience was the valueless interaction with the employees. After dealing with the uninterested box office girl, the ticket taker was actually inviting and helpful and, silly me, I got my hopes up that my experience at AMC Arizona Center 24 may actually end up being comparable to seeing a movie at a theater that charges a fraction of the cost.\n\nWe approached the refreshment stand and, as the ladies assembled our order on the counter, one held up a blacked hot dog (think of the rancid hot dog Kramer eats to avoid making Lloyd Braun think he is crazy) and asked if we wanted it. Considering we were paying $5 for a hot dog at a national chain theater that should have some kind of quality control system in place for refreshments, we declined. The girl simply turned around and handed the bad item to the back and instructed them to throw it away before grabbing a normal looking hot dog for our order. That simple so why even ask us?\n\nThough the lobby was generally empty and pairs of employees were standing around chatting in strategic locations, the condiment area was unkempt including butter-flavored soaked popcorn on the counter. Something that a $7 theater would probably just send someone to wipe down but, somehow, not a priority here.  \n\nAlso, the restrooms are a dump and don't even have mirrors. Not sure why a more expensive theater would vary from the clean restroom standard for the public park bathroom decor, but I think it's a swing-and-a-miss by AMC's interior design experts.\n\nSo why two stars? Well, Yelp doesn't allow zero star reviews (which I agree with, FTR) so everyone gets a freebie. And the in-theater experience was actually good. So, that's how AMC got a two star review for a theater I doubt I will ever again attend or recommend."
0,"It is a shame this place was not better. It has a good view and my room was ok. That is where the positives end! The staff was rude, unhelpful, and extremely scarce! I paid for club level room but had to take one not on the club floor. No big deal though. i can ride an elevator. Wish I hadn't bothered! It was a joke! DO NOT PAY FOR THIS!!!\n\nIn fact STAY ELSEWHERE!!!!! I spent 300/night for inedible room service, a sorry concierge lounge, and rude desk staff!"
0,"Wish I could rate negative stars.... With so many bar choices this place is by far the worst.\n\nLast Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident.\n\n I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of. These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law."
1,"I love this place! We keep going back for more garlic knots and Biaggio's homemade sauce straight from his Aunt Angelina! The environment is very friendly and the customer service is impeccable! \n\nWe have tried the sandwiches, pizza's, salads, garlic knots, and best of all---the Stromboli! Everything feels very high quality. :)"
0,"Terrible onion rings, super-thin soggy pizza. Too bad! It seems like a cute, family-run place that I would love to support, but I can't. \nIt also has odd hours, so call first. Closes at 2pm, reopens for dinner. Closed on Mondays. However, they often leave the street advertising banners/cards up during the times and days they're closed."
1,"Truly unique amongst Charlotte establishments with thrifted decor, bright colors and tattoo'ed waitstaff. You would almost think you are in Austin, Portland, or Brooklyn.\n\nThe menu is your standard diner fare, tweaked a bit. Veggie options abound (I love soysage). \n\nThe wait is long during the normal busy times, like Sunday morning or lunch time, and for good reason. The place is freakin' adorable.  One visit, during a particularly busy time, my party was given free Mimosas due to the staff needing to have us move tables. This earned my eternal gratitude.\n\nIt also seems to be highly populated by very fashionable and put-together women and hotty men. Always a plus."
1,"Amazing salads! Some of the specials they run can be a bit pricy if you add meat but they are worth it. I would love if they opened earlier, around 6, for breakfast. I would stop by every day on my way to work!"
1,"I LOVE SITTING AT CONCERTS.\n\nI think it's part of the contract of being in my twenties that I'm supposed to enjoy standing in a mosh pit five feet from the stage. 'Cuz everyone likes getting sprayed with the lead singer's sweat, right? Well, I love sitting at concerts and am instantly fond of any venue that has the option to stand up close and personal or sit and soak up some tunes from afar. As Steve said, not a bad seat in the place. One of my favorite venues!"

1,"Why does this place only have 3 stars? Unbelievable! I had an amazing time here!\n\nI came to TAO on my last night in Vegas with a group of friends. My friend is a promoter there his name is Andy, hooked us up with a really nice table. Huge booth right in the middle. We came here for my birthday celebration. Got bottles of Hennessy Privilege and champagne. There are girls with pasties sitting inside a tub and girls on ropes in the air. We got in fine with no problems with excellent service. The waitress was fantastic. She stood around the table waiting on us to see if we needed anything else. When it was midnight all of a sudden Confetti and smoke and sparklers were everywhere. The waitresses came with a huge bottle of Dom P. and a plate of cake pops and fruits. It was a birthday SURPRISE! I was so shocked! it was fantastic! I also loved the music! It was hip hop mixed into trance! \n\nthere are cubbies that are hidden where the girls can put their coats and clutches if needed. The only thing I didn't like it the bathroom was all the way upstairs and a long line. When people have alcohol in them, they need to restroom! LOL. Wish there was faster access to that. The patio is nice, great view but kind of small. \n\nTAO has beautiful decor and a very \""Geisha\"" feel to it. LOVE IT!"
1,"Casey's is always one of our stops when out drinking on Mill. Love the bar staff, most of them have been there for years.\n\nA great place to day drink (when the weathers nice of course).\n\nIf youve only ever drank at Casey's, you NEED to come back for lunch/dinner one day. Their food is stellar. \n\nFaves include: Hippie sandwich (I love that they use pesto as mayo), Potato salad, Fried Zucchini, Chipotle hummus, Reuben, Classic club, Croissant sandwich, and finally their New England clam chowder."
1,What a fun evening!  This was our first time and we loved it.  Giuseppe is a true Italian from Naples and he has created such a fun atmosphere.  The place was packed and everyone seemed happy.  It is so nice to be able to bring our own wine instead of paying $70 for a $20 bottle of wine.\n\nThe food is fresh and tasty.  Giuseppe has adopted the American version of Italian food but it all tastes so good.  This is not like Andreolis where Giovanni still prepares dishes just as you would find them in Italy but it is really good.  I had the lasagne which was first rate.  My father-in-law had the veal parmigian which was excellent.  The others had pastas with the marinara sauce--all delicious.  We topped it off with tiramisu and Cannoli which were both wonderful.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I save that for the restaurants that serve truly authentic Italian food.  Finally our waiter made the evening so much fun.  He employed my daughters to serve other tables while we waited.  He joked with us without being obnoxious.  He's the guy who looks a lot like Jesse in Breaking Bad.\n\nI absolutely recommend this place.  You will have so much fun and the food is great.

0,"Had lunch there today. Asked for no carb meal. Ordered only meat from cheeseburger. Charged $9.00  for less than half the meal. Realizing that the meat is a large chunk on cost, but wasn't even offered reduced price. Burger was not even all that great!\n\nToo many places to eat in Charlotte. Never again for me!"
1,"Look. I hate to admit I even go to buffets from time to time but this is actually a pretty decent Chinese buffet.\n\nThe employees were all very friendly and they were very attentive, the food was actually very flavorful and very good, it has Mongolian barbecue and a sushi station.\n\nThe upside to this buffet is that you can eat as healthy or as bad as you would like. For a Chinese buffet in a marginal area of town is actually remarkably very clean. It is definitely worth checking out. There's no way to give a buffet five stars so this will get a solid four star from me. When you take into consideration the price you really can't beat it.\n\nSidenote; I went there at 3 PM on a weekday."
0,"I am completely puzzled by the amount of high-star reviews for Pizza Fusion.  I will assume that it is for the dine-in experience rather than delivery and proceed with my review. Moving on...\n\nFirst of all, the pizza we received looked nothing like the photos provided on Pizza Fusion's Yelp page (so no Yelp...they were not helpful).  I am writing this as the remnants of the Bruschetta Pizza and Fusion Salad still lays strewn in a disappointing, half eaten mess on the kitchen counter.  \n\nThe Fusion Salad with the balsamic vinaigrette dressing was actually not too bad.  The \""crostini\"" included was as hard as a rock and I may save it to sharpen our kitchen knives with later on this year.  Despite the very efficient online ordering system, they seem to have left off the extra Gorgonzola cheese we requested (for about $54,892.99 extra).  This misstep simply added to the very pleasant experience Pizza Fusion had in store for us once we got to the pizza.\n\nNow, I've been a pizza lover pretty much since birth.  Homemade pizza, frozen pizza, authentic Italian, Chicago Style, Brooklyn Style, and everything in between I've eaten...and most likely loved.  I even secretly partook in the $5 Little Caesar's deal during my college years.  Not to mention, I'm pretty easy to please....until I had Pizza Fusion.  I've never quite experienced a pizza that was actually \""dry\"" before...but they managed to pull it off.  The description of the Bruschetta Pizza was ever so tempting...blend of cheeses, fresh basil, diced tomatoes, balsamic vinegar...sounded delicious.  We threw on pepperoni for a little protein and voila! We thought we nailed Perfect Pizza Monday. \n\nGood Lord in heaven were we wrong.  The \""diced\"" tomatoes were an interesting shade of light orange, I will assume they were \""gourmet\"".  The additional pepperoni we requested (at an additional $78,898.00) was burnt so badly we assumed they were trying to surprise us with beef jerky.  That's okay. I'm down. I like surprises.  But the combination of the beef jerky and crust that was chewier than hardened Now & Laters just created a combination our jaws could not withstand.  Thankfully my dentist is free tomorrow to pop it back into place after the imminent dislocation. \n\nThe only reason I upgraded my review to 2 stars was due to the online ordering option.  I'm a sucker for that.  I can only hope the dine-in experience is better than delivery.  I must warn you, if you opt for the delivery option you will find yourself longing for the Domino's Pizza Tracker to blink excitedly across your IPad screen as Mike \""carefully prepares your pizza\"".  Or you will just end up walking down to the Harris Teeter for a Totino's Party Pizza...either option are far better than the Playschool quality food we had this evening. \n\nGross."
0,"I paid $110 for a detail and unfortunately didn't check my car thoroughly and have already left to go home which is outside of Phoenix. Otherwise I'd take my car back. Paying this amount of money I expect that no detail would be overlooked, but the entire back window area of my car is still dirty as are many of the corners of my interior. They obviously did a quick wipe down of my interior which is unacceptable for what was supposed to be auto detailing. This looks like a regular wash job. Maybe this place is good for a quick wash, but DO NOT pay them for detailing!"
1,"The Saffron Market and Boutique is a hidden gem in north Scottsdale. I live and shop in the neighborhood and am always on the lookout for unique shops with quality products and great customer service. The Saffron Market and Boutique is under new ownership and the new owner has done a lot to expand her selection of middle eastern, Asian and hard to find products from around the world. The shop is bright, colorful, very clean with staff that is always ready to help find what you're looking for. I love their unique selections of tea, coffee and fresh pastries.  You should definitely stop in and check it out, it's like a little trip to India and the Middle East."
1,One of the places with the best steak and service. My boyfriend took me out for a birthday dinner and I couldn't ask for better service or steak. The lava cake was nothing but a mouthful of delicious chocolate melting in your mouth. Looking forward to come back again sometome.
0,"I wanted to leave a short review prior to my stepping foot in the place as I, too purchased a living social deal quite awhile back and was subjected to extremely rude behavior from the one they call Gary.  It was nearly impossible to get anyone on the phone and when I finally did I was met with nothing more than attitude and an \""I'm too busy to be making this call\"" tone (there's a slight chance I was literally told that exactly).  I never did make an appointment as I didn't want to inconvenience anyone with my presence and therefore lost out on the value of said deal.  In reading all of these magnificent reviews it appears that I may have been the biggest winner of all.  My curiosity has been poked and now I'm almost tempted to see if it's as bad as you say! Or perhaps Gary has read the reviews as well and decided to make improvements. I would hope some criticism would open his eyes to make a few changes. I promise to write a new review if I get brave enough to enter."
1,The melting pot burger is delicious and just perfect. Quite literally feels like it just melts in your mouth. My favorite burger joint in Madison. I'm not a fan of the interior design and dark lighting and usually order for pick up.
1,Adding another star since my last review.\n\nI just had their white pizza today and topped it with the tiramisu. Both are highly recommended.
0,"I have been to XS a few times and I love the place.  Please note this review applies to 3/13/2012 (Monday) when Lil' Jon was there. \n\nBefore Lil Jon started spinning, it was pretty decent for Monday night but as soon as he started spinning, the place went insane!  (I have to admit his performace was amazing!).  While he was performing, more people came in and the place was so crowded to the point where it was very unsafe (people were pushing each other).  \n\nPlease understand that I am a big guy and I have worked as a bouncer here and there last 7 years which include top clubs in LA and San Francisco so I am very familiar with crowd control.  It eventually reached the point where I felt \""very unsafe\"" so I left.   \n\nWe went to Marquee next night.  Ironically, bouncers there handled the crowd very well - they were making sure that dance floor was not overcapacity.  \n\nI hate to say this but XS management needs to put the safety first..."
1,"Selling upper class jewellery of a high quality, Pebbles is nevertheless edgy and contemporary.\n\nMixing traditional styles with new materials and designs, their range of jewellery is eyecatching as well as being elegant. Lending inspiration from a variety of era's, the pieces come together to form a very unusual and striking accessory.\n\nPrices and styles vary according to what you're going for. Some of the designers such as Stagg are expensive, but undoubtedly worth it as the pretty but durable bracelets look like they'd last a lifetime. Some pieces look delicate, while others lean towards statement jewellery.\n\nThey have ranges for men, women and children. Pebbles cater for wedding accessories as much as gifts, but have some delicious rings and necklaces if you're looking to spoil yourself. It's expensive and unfortunately I don't have the cash to burn, but if I did I would set it alight in Pebbles. A wonderful anchor necklace has stolen my heart. I'm sure something will steal yours, too."

1,"this was a nice find. my usual nursery was out of thuricide, a chemical i desperately needed to thwart the skeletonizers ravaging my beautiful grapes. \n\nthe place is well laid out, but felt a bit over my comfort zone....much like that fancy gym on camelback.....\n\ni don't know if their prices overall are more expensive given their location,  but the staff was extremely knowledgeable in helping me find what i needed. i have driven by here and noticed their gates are close at 5pm? isn't that when most regular people get off work and need to shop for stuff?"

0,"AUTO INSURANCE COVERAGE.  Watch out for Enterprise. Car Rental\n\nOne thing you have to watch out is the auto insurance.  They are $16 to $20 a day.  Even if you told them you don't want it, they still circle it in the contract for you to sign.  Or, they don't circle anyplace and let you look at the fine print and hope that you would cycle the place where it says you want to buy insurance.\nEnterprise is very bad on this.  They push very hard and con you to take the insurance. Watch Out for Enterprise.\n\nWe rented a car for 10 days.  We told the agent that we didn't want any coverage, including collision.  Usually they would cycle the box for us to initial.  Now Enterprise Car  may not do it.  They let us look at the fine print and cycle yourselves.  I cycled the wrong box.  Thy agent knew that we did not want any coverage,but still entered it in the computer system.  It is unethical.  Enterprise push very hard on it because it is a money maker and I think the agent who sell them get a commission."
0,"If you've contracted some kind of horrible respiratory disease that can only be mitigated by high temperatures and arid climates, I guess I'm happy that you can watch live major league baseball. Other than that, I have a hard time thinking of nice things to say about the AZ Diamondbacks' home venue. Not sure which  I find most annoying, the southwestern teal motif, or the fans who seem to be more interested in the A/C unit that cools the place than the quality of baseball that's being played in it. \n\nCheck this one off the list. AZ is for Spring Training baseball."
1,"Stumbled into this place while vacationing in Scottsdale for Spring Training. I was suffering from one of those hangovers that makes you feel your pulse in your dome. My buddy(who was campaigning for breakfast at Taco Bell..who does that?) was driving like a kamikaze pilot and responded to the vehicle full of people pointing towards Paradise and grunting uggghhh. While walking up to the door an odd brown dribble stain was pointing us towards the entrance. Didn't know what to make of this. Also wasn't sure if it was from my friends who had plodded in ahead of me. Once entering this fine establishment my not-so-working-correct brain couldn't comprehend the two different counters. Also confusing was the two menus. Being told what was going on by a nice gal behind the counter didn't help much since English was definitely my second language at this point in time. After just pointing at what I needed I was ushered along to the cash register. I got my number sat with my group and waited.....and waited......and waited. As more time passed I began to ponder what the actual construction and building time for a croissant sandwich was. Also helping was my wife reminding me of every person that got there food ahead of me. We were asked how are food was a couple of times so I figure they could sense my frustration as to not having it. Then my glorious croissant sandwich was brought to me. It tasted absolutely magnificent. I could have died right then and been happy. To make up for this delay the manager brought us THREE boxes of cookies. I didn't catch her name, but damn if she didn't pass customer relations 101. Tossing me a free OJ would've been sufficient, but to give this wild pack of drunken animals munchies for the weekend went above and beyond. I will definitely crawl back in the next time I visit Scottsdale."
0,"The first set of lashes was great.  The second set, on my left eye, on about the 3rd day enough fell out to see a difference.  By the time they could squeeze me in again, I had to pay the full price.  The third visit, my stylist started chatting with the receptionist about crap a customer has no business listening to and she lost focus, my lashes went everywhere, no congruity.  The fifth and final set, I mentioned we had just financed my boyfriends daughters salon in North Las Vegas and I kid you not by the time I checked out, they told me it was their policy not to service \""their competition\"".  What the heck?  Where's the neighborly love?  I guess that only happens in small country towns.  Whatever, the best stylists build their clientele and go off and open their own little studios.  They are the \""true\"" masters.  I recommend trying the little ones popping up around town.  Thumbs down for Cherry Lash Lounge.  They charge you the minute you make an appt. and it stays no matter if you cancel ahead of time or not!!"
0,"Usually very pleased with Tee Pee, especially before a DBacks game. But tonight two really disappointing things happened. First, we arrived about 40 min before the game and the main wave of people were already gone. We were alone in the dining room and I mean alone - as in no waitresses for 5 minutes. Beer glasses were warm (they'd just been washed! We were told) and only 2 small bowls of chips for 6 people. Most disappointing, though, was that my grandfather forgot his jacket in the booth when we left for the game. I called 20 min later from inside the ballpark and was told it couldn't be found. After the game my mom scoured the place and it was still MIA. Very sad to think it was taken."
1,"For what it is, this place is a diamond in the rough.  I'm a business traveler who is used to crap restaurants while staying in business park areas, but this place is beyond that.  \n\nThe atmosphere is what I would call \""tavernish\"" - a few TV's and arcade games in the corner, but overall fun and friendly.  After sitting down at the bar and ordering a drink, I informed the friendly bar tender that it was my first time in the restaurant.  Shorlty after receiving my obnoxiously large bourbon on the rocks, I was presented with a free sampler platter of pulled pork, smoked chicken salad, collard greens, and mac- n-cheese, all of which was delish.  I started with the \""'maters\"" (fried green tomatoes), and they were slightly above average for the South.  I then moved on to their \""award winning\"" ribs - incredible.  The service here can't be beat, based on the attention I received. \n\nMy rating of this place is based in the type of establishment, and the location.  Establishments of this caliber are few and far between in areas such as this.  Don't get me wrong, this is no substitute for a night on the town in Uptown Charlotte, but on business, and not feeling like heading Uptown, this is a great place.  Full of locals as well, which is of course a good sign.\n\nThe prices are good as well.  I had my starter, entree (with two great sides), two huge bourbons, and a beer for $50 before tip.  Many great sounding entrees were under $15 as well (not the ribs), so it could have been far cheaper."
0,"Don't waste your time waiting for or watching this \""show.\"" It's a bunch of scantily clad women on one ship fighting guys on another ship. The way the women fight is by singing. At least the men shoot canyons as their way to fight. The men's ship sinks during the show but TI can't even wait until the end of the show to bring it back up. If you still want to watch it, get there at least 20 minutes before to get a good spot."
0,"took a long time to even be noticed to get seated.  Once done service was good.  Food was rather oily.  Mom had a burrito of some sort, and me fajitas.  I would rather go to Laredos for fajitas.\nThat day waiter seemed interested in flirting with some girls down the row of the tables, but whatever.  I wasnt asking for that, just asking for a little more attentiveness from him as a restaurant server."
1,"Paradise Melts is awesome!  We actually used them for an office staff-appreciation event.  They pulled the truck right into our office parking lot and served their awesome and unique grilled cheeses to our salivating staff.  The price for this catered event was extremely reasonable and food was top notch.  The \""aporkalypse\"" was awesome.  Owner Blaise and his girlfriend offered top notch service as well.  5 star operation all around!"
0,"The night my friend and I decided to go to 3 Amigos was a very good case of simple curiosity, high hopes, and then the sobering and crashing reality. I don't have my qualms with bad Mexican food, hell I eat at Taco Bell at least once a month and that is about as shitty as it gets but when I go to a sit down Mexican restaurant I expect a higher standard. Now, don't get me wrong 3 Amigos was not Taco Bell quality, it was higher quality food but prepared hastily served by an unhappy waiter who was practically chewing his nails to get out of work. \n\n When walking into the faux-fiesta lit restaurant I really wanted to enjoy myself but the poor quality food and lack-luster waiter who paid most attention to us when it came time to tip than he did the rest of the evening, did not meet my standards for a good dining experience. The waiter unfortunately was moody the whole time he was serving us but I chose to ignore the fact and plot my revenge later on Yelp. I ordered sangria which was more water than wine and an enchilada that was served with poor cuts of chicken breast topped in a very dismal green sauce. I wanted kick and spice, hadn't any of these people seen Speedy Gonzalez? Mexican food should always strive to get that kind of reaction out of people. Perhaps the Canadians are too far away from Mexico to understand the treats of a quality enchilada but I was less than impressed with the dish (If you wanted a witty remark like \""Fiesta? More like Siesta!\"" unfortunately you won't find it here). \n\n In the end the price was definitely not worth it. St. Denis is a large street with many options, you want good booze? Try the Microbrewery, Les 3 Brasseurs, across the street. You want ethnic food? Try Zyng right up the block. Both will do food and booze much more justice than this place. The waiter, the loud overwhelming atmosphere, and the poor excuse for ethnic food, to me were not worth the near $50 I spent when there are plenty of other better and cheaper options on such an active street."
0,This place is right around the corner from where I live so thought I would stop by to check it out because they advertised $2 Dos Equis today. Ordered the green chile burger. Worst burger I think I ever ate. No flavor at all. Some type of flavorless green paste on it. It reeked of stale smoke even though it was non smoking. The only thing good about it was the beer. I won't go back.
0,"my last review, i didn't want to give this place any stars, so this review, i'm giving it one. they finally got wings!!! since it's the middle of the night and we're pretty red in the face, we order 50 medium and 50 hot with some fries. only to be disappointed that we get 50 medium and 20 hot. ummmm, wtf?!?!\n\nand we got some dude as our waiter. no hooters girls here?!?! isn't that everyone expects?"
0,"This sprawling Korean is the epitome of Las Vegas Korean food scene - mediocre food and service that define what Korean is all about in Sin City.  Why is it that a major city just 4 hours drive away from the best Korean food outside of Korea can't get it straight?  Especially when it has to compete against so many other outstanding Asian cuisines?  As I've said before, Thai and Japanese in Vegas are tops.  Vietnamese and Chinese can't compete with L.A. but still offer vast array of choices and flavors.  Why aren't Korean vendors making their way out of L.A. into Vegas and setting up shop to rival Ham Ji Park, Gobawoo, and Baek Jeong?\n\nWe decide to head over to Commercial Center while looking at Turnberry Place and, Jin Mee being the biggest place here, decide we'll stop there for some naengmyun.  Walking in the server sits us right away, and throughout the meal the service was quick although not what I would call scintillating.  Just a bit off when it came to enthusiasm, pleasant responses, etc. but still passable.  Decor is typical Korean, spartan and not interesting but clean.\n\nWe order a raw fish naengmyun and a jjamjjamyun, which is half jjajangmyun and jjamppong.  They come in less than 10 minutes, so timing is good.  My first bite of the naengmyun and... it's sort of cool.  Far from ice cold which is what it's supposed to be.  Taste is good, but not the effect I want.  The Chinese noodles also taste good, but they also have some shortcomings.  The jjajangmyun sauce is overly jelly-ish and there are chunks of gelatin throughout, which indicates the sauce has not been mixed very well.  I'm wondering if these are pre-packaged stuff.  There are places where the food tastes good and you finish it even if you're full.  There are others where it tastes good initially, but then wears on you as you make your way through the plate.  This was one of those.\n\nIn the end, the food that gets tired, uninteresting decor, and off-and-on service all amount to a 2.5 stars.   Lukewarm naengmyun gets half a point docked because that is inexcusable.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  Will probably be fine when they're not busy."
1,Love this place but if you get there after 12 on a week day be prepared for a large crowd. it is a little different than the Mongolian BBQ places we have been to out west but it is a great lunch alternative in Charlotte and you will not walk away feeling hungry thats for sure.
1,"I got The Full Montagu! It was the best sandwich I ever had! Taste good, juicy inside and the sandwich was not baked too much!"
0,"Okay, you have an outside bar and there is live music right outside (great band - Ratio) and this place still has their music blaring causing terrible noise!  And they permit smoking!  Ruined a nice night out too bad they don't choose to capitalize on the free entertainment.  Will not be back to this place, will enjoy the entertainment outside instead and eat elsewhere where you can breath and not leave stinking like a dirty ashtray."
0,"I'd love to give this place a higher rating BUT I never even got the chance to try a cupcake. \nAfter circling the block for about 10 minutes because not being from the area the bakery is not well marked. \nThat wasn't the issue. \nSo, the bakery was pretty full of people waiting for some other flavors to be brought out. I was one of them too. \n10-15 minutes later.........I was ignored by not one, not two, but three of the employees. I was standing in line just like the other customers but was overlooked by three people. \nI have not decided if I would even attempt to go back because of this experience."

0,"Terrible experience yesterday!  We went specifically to watch the Arizona Rattlers win the Arena Bowl and had to beg and plead for them to put the game on. After finally convincing them to put the game on in order for us to get sound to the game we had to ask other fans there to request the same thing, since they told us we weren't enough of a majority to make it worth their while.  When we arrived we were one of only a few tables there....seemed that they would have rather played 80's rock music instead of supporting one of our Arizona teams.  The manager Brian was extremely rude and refused to accommodate us.  The service was mediocre and the food was the same.  We only went there to watch the game...we called ahead and stopped in a couple days prior to be sure they would be playing it, but it seemed to be such an inconvenience once we arrived.  Will never be back to that location for sure."
1,"Stayed here when my brother was in Vegas for a convention and I just slept in the room his company provided for him. The room was comfortable and rather spacious, but getting from the elevator to the room was a hike! I had no idea how large this hotel is and most of the time I felt like I would get lost if I didn't pay close attention to what was going on.\n\nThe service wasn't bad. I managed to get a massage booked in the day I got there and it was nice and relaxing although the room was really small where the massage was.\n\nAll in all, not bad. Not sure how much the room was so I'm not able to compare it in terms of whether it was value for money."
0,"Meh, not the \""best\"" by far concerning the pizza. Like the fresh tomatoes but lacking in flavor from the other toppings. Maybe it's cause the crust is too heavy. There are better options especially in scottsdale."
1,Great time. We had a groupon here a while ago and they even gave us extra laps for each racer. It was a fun time. Wish it was outdoor though. The karts are in good condition and the track is definitely a fun one. If you are a beginner or a pro you will definitely have a great time here!!!
1,"I want to thank you for helping my wife with her PT Cruiser problem. We live south of Tucson and away from our local mechanic.

You deserve it.\n\nPaul K."
1,"I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but Keg has always been a favorite of mine and never disappoints.  We came here for a friend's birthday dinner when in Montreal for the weekend and had an amazing meal.  We had a great server, who was very attentive but still let us take our time and enjoy our meal.  We ordered cocktails and the crab and spinach dip to start - so delicious!  From there we moved on to red wine and steak for our mains.  I had the blue cheese filet with a twice baked potato and it was amazing.  I was sooo full but had to keep eating!  Our server also suggested a great red wine that I had never had before but I will look out for in the future as I really enjoyed it!\n\nAt the end of our meal, they brought out a piece of ice cream cake with a sparkler for the birthday girl (complimentary) which was a really nice touch and very appreciated by all of us!  I have been to quite a few Kegs in different cities and this one has to be one of my favorites - it has very modern and updated d\u00e9cor and comes off classier than some others I have been to in the past.  Overall, I definitely recommend this Keg as it is a reliable menu you can count on, great atmosphere and great service."
1,"AWESOME feeling flying by helicopter! \nI've done the Vegas Strip night tour couple of times with friends, a few dates and once by myself. It has never disappointed in providing an adrenaline rush. The experience has always been exhilarating. The helicopter slashing through the air, making sharp turns then ascending and descending quickly wow. \n\nThe Vegas skyline from a birds eye view is unreal. This is not your typical skyline you flying over like in LA or NY which are just work company edifices. Vegas casino buildings have a life of their own and are exciting to see from the air with all their flashing lights, different colors, shapes and sizes.\nNo, you'll not hit the Stratosphere Tower so rest easy these pilots know what they're doing and are pretty cool.\n\nThe night tour is not long about 10 minutes but it will be some of the best ten minutes you'll have in Vegas and perhaps in years. Believe me, this ride you won't forget.\nThis kind of adventurous excursion is ideal for couples. Surprise her.\nSeriously, I can't think of a bad thing to say about this experience. Just do it!"
0,"Thank you Spirit Airlines for being the airline that lacks compassion. My grandmother passed away before I could use my airline ticket that I purchased to say my goodbyes. In an attempt to modify my ticket to fly out for the funeral, I encountered rude and unhelpful operators. Spirit Airlines policy is to charge the consumer a $125 fee to cancel a reservation and receive zero credit from the original plane ticket purchased. The other option is to pay $125 to modify the ticket to another date, which is slightly reasonable. What was not reasonable was telling a mourning grandchild that they must immediately pick a date to modify their trip for a funeral. When I was disappointed to hear that they had no grievance policy, I informed them that I would need to call back since I was unsure of the funeral dates. The operator's response was \""Just to let you know Ms. Perez, when you call back our policies will not change.\"" I work in a profession that allows our employees to do what is in the customer's best interest. I am truly disappointed and disgusted with Spirit Airlines. I encourage everyone I know to never fly this airline. It is not worth the money saved flying a discount airline. Going forward, we will always fly a more reputable airline no matter what the savings may be with Spirit."

Service: Although the line was long at the check-in, some of the clerks were just looking into the computer screens and not bothering to help ppl check in faster.   Unit: EVERYTHING in the unit  was very dated: from plumbing to the bed covers. Not even basic toiletries were provided. No tea or coffee pot.  Old bulky TV's taking up lots of space. .. Dual Piano bar was hideous with $25 per person entry.  Wait is extremely long by the elevators,  10 -15 min during check-out time.  Will never stay there again."

0,"I had eaten at this place before, and was impressed.  However, this last time was awful.  Our server was either new or not very bright.  She has no knowledge of the menu.  I know what you are probably saying, I'm just being to critical.  I've worked in restaurants my entire career.  I been a waitress, manager, bartender...you name it I've done it.  The service was just awful.  She asked me to point to the item on the menu so she knew what I ordered.  I ordered their signature eggs Benedict, my boyfriend ordered their steak and eggs.  After about 20 minutes of waiting our server comes up and says there steak shipment didn't come in.  And I mean that's all she said.  She didn't come with a menu, and didn't explain what that meant.  I asked well then can we look at the menu again.  She kindly brought it to us, but at this point we had already waited 20 minutes.  My boyfriend and I were starving.  We decided to leave.  On our way out, he told the manager what had happened and she just said \""Okay\"", and looked at him blankly.  There was no apology, no acknowledgement of the situation.  Keep in mind the person he told was the owner.  There was no professionalism involved at all.  This is a prime example of people that think they can open up a restaurant just because they can cook.  I will not be back.  And I do not like their cinnamon rolls.  They are very dense.  I hate to be hurtful, but the service was just that bad.  The server we had should have never been allowed to work until she learned a little bit more about server etiquette.  We ended up going to Crazy Otto's which is delicious.  I recommended the biscuits and gravy."
0,Worst food I have ever ordered. How does anyone eat this garbage? The bar is nice and has several tv's. Just save your money and forget the food. Yuck. We had a good waiter but the food runner was worthless. Dropped off the food and we Asked for silverware and she was gone before we could finish the sentence. How are they still in business?
0,I wouldn't recommend going to computer guys. They were very unprofessional and very inexperienced. I took my computer in to have it checked out. I suspect that problem was power supply. They told me i needed to upgrade motherboard and memory as well as change power supply. So i said ok. They also told me it would take about a week to order parts since they didnt have any in stock. Well it took longer than that and when parts came in they told me i didn't need motherboard just the memory and so they had to order to right memory sticks. It just seems like they didn't know what they were doing. I got such a run around i will never go back. Its been over a year since this took place and im already having memory issues. Need to find another shop to go to
0,"I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one. By the time I get to the register it's 10:30 and I am told I can't order breakfast even though I was in line before 10:30. The cashier let me order breakfast anyway - all I want is a McMuffin - and I proceed to wait twenty minutes to even get my order. I might have been able to forgive this considering there were two huge orders ahead of mine (Easter breakfast for the whole family, I guess) except my McMuffin was soggy, and my iced coffee was so stale I couldn't taste the flavored syrup in it. Worst of all, even after I got my food, I still had to wait for my coffee, because they had decided to make coffee for other orders first. You can be sure I will do my very best to never come here again."
1,"Go on, be adventurous.\n\nIf you don't know much about Indian food, you are going to be confused when you try to order. There are several different menus posted up on the wall and nothing has much of an explanation. Just order random stuff and know that it's going to be tasty.\n\nI'm no Indian food expert, but with all cuisines, you just have throw caution to the wind and try it. Thankfully, I haven't had anything bad here so this place will reward you for your curiosity.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and don't forget to try their chai!"
0,"I swear to god, I tried almost every. single. dish. And I honestly wanted to love this place but everything was mediocre at best. \n\nThe best part of the meal was the paella, but the seafood here just isn't very fresh - you know when shrimp gets mushy/rubbery when frozen? And I can't believe I dropped so much for those \""filet mignon\"" burgers which were so overrated! I would recommend against the sangria as well which was wayyy too sweet. \n\nThe people were really nice, and it's good for groups, but it's really just not very good food.\n\nSorry Firefly!"
0,"scam!!!! scam!!! scam!!!!  do notttt get this card! i have had many credit cards in my life including gold amex business and personal.. we developed credit issues because of medical bills. we ended up in bankruptcy. after a time we were working on rebuilding credit. i received a capital 1 account.... i worked on good payment history. soon, i received another offer. credit 1.....  horrific experience!!!  when i activated card is when a fee was assessed... then on top of high interest there is a large fee if you lose card and if you call to make phone payment it is a $9.95 fee to do this by phone - the problem is it's all scams to cause more fees, fees and more fees. so,\ni called to make payment to pay off account. i paid and asked over and over if all fees and everything were paid off.  i was then shipped over to a guy trying to keep me. i explained my position and said i wanted  to pay and close account... he says ok.. he processed my payment and said all was paid.... \n   i was getting a weird gut feeling that things were not right.\ni decided to call about a month later... the guy says i have a balance of $10.  -----  and there was a $9.95 charge to pay my balance... they  seem to be in control of your credit and extort people and drag them into web of deciept and supper feeeeeeeeeeees!!! i am now forced to file complaint with gov. please take extreme caution!!!!"
1,"Love this place.  Their portions are pretty big, I always end up with something left over.  And their soups are tasty.  It kind of reminds me of Panera Bread, but with bigger servings and more selection.  And they deliver.  $20 minimum for delivery, understandable.\n\nService is a very relaxed, unfortunately sometimes rude, but I don't have to spend much time with them so I can overlook it.\n\nOther than that, this is a great place for soups and sandwiches.  Their pastas are delicious too."
0,"We were really disappointed in our experience here.  We ate there at 11pm on Valentines Day night.  My boyfriend mmade the reservation a month in advance and even called to push out the time the same night because his flight in was delayed.  When we got there they said they did not have a reservation for us.  When they sat us we asked to be moved to a bigger empty table and were told it was \""reserved\"". At least someone's reservation was recorded. So we sat at a tiny table and proceeded to be waited on  by the most disinterested and rude waitress.  Don't remember her name but she had a 16 tattoo.  She was not in the mood for any questions on the dessert and could not be bothered to give us some direction on the fondue.  She should have explained all the items included along with the best way to enjoy the dessert.  It's Valentines Day!  This is supposed to be an experience. We ordered two desserts including the fondue and it barely fit on the tiny table and we were constantly worried we would catch on fire from the flame on the fondue tray.  Oh and that bigger table we had requested that was \""reserved\"" sat empty the whole time.  Not the place to go for a special evening or really ever.  We'll stick with Raku Sweets."

1,"I usually take my dog Dooby to petsmart to get him groomed but my friend Edie had mentioned how great top dog grooming is to me. I decided to give them a shot. My dog Dooby is a medium sized puggle, which means he's half pug half beagle. He is the sweetest baby, however he is disobedient!! I called ahead of time to see how much they would charge me and for everything I needed done to Dooby, and it was reasonable priced. I brought in my scoobin roo, and they welcomed me kindly, had me fill out a little card (it being my first time in) and took Dooby back. By the time I was done filling out the card I saw Dooby in the back getting a bath. He looked very calm and happy. That made me feel really comfortable. I went a couple doors down to get my nails done, about 45 minutes later I came to check on him and he already looks super handsome. They needed a little more time with the scoobin roo, so I took a little walk to above the crust and chilled out for a little. About ten minutes later they called me, and told me Dooby was ready to go! I walked in and saw my baby standing up on his hind legs crying for me. First thing I noticed was his new halloween bandana! He looked so clean, smelled amazing, they did an amazing job on brushing his teeth (since he runs for the hills when I try) and his nails looked great! I was so thankful they took such great care of the Scoobin Rubin lover of my life! Great job Guys!"
0,"I had the Tenderloin Triumph today, and it was less than triumphant. I thought it would be a fairly hearty steak sandwich, and I was looking forward to the horseradish sauce and \""rustic\"" French bread. Well, it was basically roast beef on white bread. The sauce had no kick and the bread had a totally bland and squishy texture. Ate a slice of German chocolate cake; the filling was yummy, but the cake was dry and not very flavorful."
1,This place is consistently good. I have tried many items on menu everything was good. Pho has good flavor. \n\nService is good and fast one of the best places in Chinatown.
1,Best Hawaiian/Filipino fusion ever. I love their food. Service is good. I usually get their lumpia and some kind of rice dish. Students from my school come here all.the.time.
0,Dinner was horrible! Service was horrible! HORRIBLE experience!! Never Again!
0,"Well stocked, organized, marked, clean store. Unfortunately most of the staff knows little about the products and often gives the wrong answers. A couple of the older gentlemen know a bit more, but they are hard to find. And the other more senior folks routinely walk by, too busy to ask if you need help. Nice facility, but quality and knowledge of the staff needs work. I usually prefer shopping at an Ace or True Value, but the frustration of not being helped and then getting someone who has no idea about the products is enough to send me a couple miles further on down the road."
1,"This was a great hotel to stay in over our Spring Break holiday the rooms were large enough to accommodate 4 guys very comfortably. The kitchen was a life saver as we were able to cook and cut down on food costs which gave us more money to have fun with on the strip. The hotel is clean and quiet, a must have when you get home at 5 or 6am and all you want is a retreat from lights and crowds.The staff here are very friendly and down to earth, every night before we would head out the ladies at the desk would compliment us on our attire and hell who doesn't enjoy compliments? It's far off the strip but the daily shuttle runs at convenient times and can drop you off at the Excalibur and if you're in your 20's you can walk a mile or two. Being off the strip has it's advantages  though you're close to a supermarket that sells liquor! Theres a In N Out and a Denny's a short walk/ride away which is awesome on a college budget. Yeah when girls asked us where we were staying I would mutter the name but if you have a little game you don't need a penthouse at the Wynn (Though it probably helps). At least we were all comfortable in separate beds and not crammed into a $150 a night matchbox with a view of a wall. Bottom line it was Affordable, Quiet, and Roomy would definitely stay here again if we cant get the Wyndham this year.\n\n*Keep in mind this is a family/retiree oriented resort so you won't really catch any ladies at the pool unless you like liver spots and wrinkles...\n\n**Ask Fred the shuttle driver about the night he hit it big! Best Vegas story ever!!"
1,"Love this place! \nThe manager (I believe his name was Wayne) was veer sweet, courteous, and informative. I was a bit confused when we first got there, but Wayne walked us around and showed us the different rooms (kids party room, adult party room, wedding chapel) and talked about the different events they have held here ~ STILL CAN'T BELIEVE NUDISTS COME HERE ONCE A YEAR TO MINI GOLF PARTY HERE!"
0,"I ate here for the first, and last, time tonight. I can't remember the name of the sandwich I ordered, but it was steak with caramelized onions on smashed bread. It was dry, dry, dry. The onions were about half cooked, certainly not caramelized. The steak, besides being dry, had no flavor. I guess the best thing I had was a few french  fries. Two people in our party arrived late, placed their orders, and waited. And waited. Finally, someone brought the bill. All of the orders, even the late ones were on there, along with the tip, but still the food hadn't arrived. They had to ask for it again. It was never even made."
1,"Being from Kentucky, I have a deep dark desire for biscuits and gravy.  So when I ordered it here in Vegas, I was expecting a pale, underseasoned paste that someone called gravy.  I could not have been more wrong!  These people know what they are doing.  The roux was browned perfectly and the mix of seasonings made this the best gravy I have had IN MY LIFE!!  Gigantic portions that I could not finish made this a place I'd come back to town for!\n\nWhen you go (and you know you want to), ask for Natasha.  Great service with a warm smile."
0,"Number one dumb ass Furniture retail store in Vegas. If I can I will rate them \""-10\"" stars. Their sales people are the most unprofessional sales in the sales industry. I don't know how they got hired but maybe only \""Furniture Center\"" will hire them. They don't care about their business and super rude with customer. The most important fact is that they don't even know their product, every question they have to call their boss for solution. What a joke!!! how the hell you sale if you don't know you product.  Don't go there people!!!! Garbage Sales"
0,"Dude, I'm so sick and tired of this place and their shitty housekeeping department.\n\nThe Mandalay Bay has definitely lowered their standards in what's \""high class\"".  They used to be such a nice and clean hotel, they've just degraded themselves with the \""hip remodel\"" of their buffet and their poor customer service/housekeeping service.\n\nWe spent 1 night here complimentary of the casino since my father is \""V.I.P.\"" here or whatever.  We were given a room on the 32nd floor and the first thing we did (learning from our previous experience) was to check the bedsheets.  We flipped them open, and one bed, there were 3 strands of HAIR and the sheets looked like they had been slept in.\n\nWe went down to the V.I.P. Lounge and asked them to do something about it.  Monica didn't give us an upgrade, even though I requested one since this was not the first time this has happened to us.  She instead, tried switching us to the 8th floor.  Um, what?  No thanks.  I complained some more and she transferred us to a room with a \""great view of the strip\"" on the 27th floor.  I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE VIEW.  I just want a clean bed to sleep in.\n\nWe go to our newly assigned room, and again flip open the sheets; and now there are 2 strands of hair.  I called Monica since I didn't want to go back down and she said there was nothing she could do but have the head of housekeeping come and take a look, since it happened in both rooms.  We waited forever for someone to come, and in the end, it wasn't even the head of housekeeping, but just a regular maid.  She was told that she was to come here to change our sheets - and at that time of the night, we were pretty tired so we just agreed.\n\nLater that evening, as my mother was getting ready to go to bed, she accidentally stepped onto the carpet with her bare feet (we usually wear slippers around the room, since we're germaphobes).  She quickly raised her feet and hanging on her toe was a strand of hair.  We then realized that the \""hairy\"" beds we encountered were probably NOT slept in, but new sheets just dragged on the floor when the maid was changing the old sheets and laying the new one on - which means they obviously don't vacuum the carpets.\n\nEither way, it's disgusting.  They need a whole new lead of housekeeping staff and system, seriously.\n\n===============================================\n\nEDIT:  I just also remembered that the next night, after coming back to the hotel from Red Rock Conservation Park, the maid had not come by to our room to re-make our bed, re-supply us with bath products, etc.; basically in simpler terms, there was no turn-down service.  Funny, in my years of staying here, this has never happened.  Like I said above, \""They need a whole new housekeeping staff and/or system, seriously.\"""

0,"I actually work next door to this place and I go there for lunch sometimes, but lately the food has not been very consistent. I say that because I order the DK Protein salad for my 30minute lunch, it was made with spring mix lettuce, everything was good until I finish half of the salad and then the rest of the lettuce was very bad and wilted, with black moldy parts of the leaf like its been sitting in the bowl for days. I didn't have time to take it back, because my lunch break was almost over. It was disappointing but I gave it another chance the next week and order the same DK Protein Salad but this time the lettuce is different, it's not the spring mix lettuce but a different type of green lettuce chopped up. i feel that if you used a certain type of lettuce and is written on the menu that thats what you should use all the time and not switch it every week and half way through my salad there was a piece of hair and a gnat in it. Running short on time again I had to throw it out. \nI'm very upset because the salad is not cheap and its not made with fresh lettuce and/or making sure its cleaned, especially for a healthier restaurant. Also the fruits are hit and miss, probably won't be supporting the place anymore."

0,"What better way to celebrate a friend turning 30 this weekend than hit up The Breakfast Club right?! Well those were our thoughts exactly so on came the leg warmers and the tacky scrunchies and off we went to experience 1980 once again!\n\nThe venue was obviously trying to cash in on the Speed Street crowds as it charged us a whopping $10 to park our cars ....and then another $7 (for girls- more for guys) to get in! I can completely understand charging for parking if we weren't entering their bar to spend money- but they obviously weren't out to please customers. \n\nSo I walked in the door after spending $17 expecting at least maybe a break on the drinks -WRONG. This was definitely not the 80s as they accounted for inflation big time! This was more/as expensive than even some of the trendier clubs in Charlotte (and nothing can be said for quality by the way). I ordered a red bull and (well) vodka - $8!\n\n.... We excitedly exclaimed we were celebrating a special Bday night but the bartender did nothing to make it special or exciting and actually gave us really bad service! \n\nI have to say my breaking point was  when I attempted to get some water for myself and my friends to which I was rudely told they only had bottled water. I mean seriously?! How irresponsible is that to serve alcoholic drinks and then not have a glass of water available!\n\n Around 12:30 I wanted to close out my tab and literally waited (trust me I kept track) twenty minutes. I can understand if for whatever reason it is packed and there is only one bartender - but they had two bartenders and a bar back (who couldn't even bother to acknowledge my presence) and the place was fairly empty! I have worked in the service industry through college and trust  me when I say I can empathize in almost any situation but I had had enough. \n\nWhen the bartender went to another group who had just walked up to the bar instead - (thankfully they pointed out that I had been waiting long before them...even though I know he saw me) ...he was not a good bartender. \n\nThe ONLY redeeming quality (hence the two-stars) was the music and the theme of the venue itself. Unfortunately that wasn't enough to save them in my eyes, as I will NOT be returning."

1,"Came here with four friends, sat at the bar, and pigged out. We ordered deviled eggs, tacos, and mac & cheese. Quite possibly the best combo known to man. A food trifecta. \n\nThe food was so delicious we couldn't stop talking about it. We were embarrassingly over excited about eating. My friend exclaimed that we sounded like a bunch of hillbillies who had never been to a restaurant before. It was just so good. The mac & cheese was the best thing I've ever put into my mouth. It was like one big food orgy. It wasn't pretty, but I wasn't on a date ... and if I were, well, I wouldn't change a thing. I would still be moaning with delight and shoving food in my mouth until it was time to go home. Oh, I'm sorry, were we supposed to have a conversation?"
1,"I have been to the Herb box for lunch  twice and have loved it each time. Located in the very chic DC ranch at Pima, the restaurant is best enjoyed if seated outside in the patio on a lovely March afternoon. \nThe mango lemonade is very soothing and the refills keep coming. Had the salmon with tsatziki and a side if the sweet potato chips . The salmon here is one of the best i have eaten and the chips are really addictive. \nI didnt have dessert this time around but have tried their graham cracker chocolate mousee before and its delicious. \nWould love to go back whenever the weather permits patio seating."

0,"We went to the pond where there's ducks and a park.  Tried to get a bit of fresh air since the weather was finally cooling down.  It's really pretty, but it was a little difficult to have a picnic there since they had no tables and chairs.  The side walk and grass were filthy from all of the duck poop, so we had to be careful where we sat.  The park area was nice.  Overall, some maintenance would work."
0,"BEWARE: If you have a problem or defect with your purchase, LV will not remedy the situation. \nI stopped by this location yesterday and received horrible customer service. I have a wallet that was purchased at another LV store and it was clearly defective. I wish I could add a photo to the review to show the problem with the wallet. After using the wallet just a few times, all of the credit card slots were curled backwards.  The first sales person who helped us said this was normal wear and tear (even though the wallet was hardly used.) Later, he backtracked and said he had seen this particular problem with this wallet in humid climates.  (Now we're getting somewhere...the wallet was purchased in Florida.) He also said the wallet was made to be light and thinner than most of their wallets and the credit card slots had a canvas backing which contributed to them curling. (Again, this seems like a problem with the product!) \n\nBottom line, they suggested that we put heavy books on the wallet to flatten out the slots....Are you kidding me??  Who wants to buy an LV wallet and lay books on it to keep the inside material from curling. \n\nI spoke with the manager. They would not exchange the wallet for a new one, would not offer a credit toward another wallet without the canvas backing, and claimed it was not possible to repair the wallet.  \nIt was made very clear that they did not care. Horrible customer service!  \n\nDo yourself a favor and go to Bottega Veneta inside Crystals. They have beautiful bags and I can vouch that they stand behind the craftsmanship and quality of their products. Best of all, they are friendly unlike the pretentious crew at Crystals LV who have no interest in retaining their customers  after they make the sale."

1,"Seeing that there is always lines on the weekends for a decent breakfast place, I am surprised more businesses don't fill that need. I was thrilled when Biscuits Caf\u00e9 opened as a close by option for weekend breakfast. I really like the staff. The servers and hostess have always been welcoming and helpful. The only thing that needs improvement is the cooks. Even the servers got frustrated with them and said they kept making the same mistakes over and over again. Despite that, the food is good, they give lots of it, too much actually, and I like the ambience."
1,"What I got: 12\"" Cheesesteak with extra peppers\n\nPros: the sandwich was great. The mixture of cheese, peppers and steak worked well together.\n\nCons: the beef steak was a tad bit dry. The cheese made up for the lack of moisture."
0,"I had heard that this place has the best falafel in the valley, so, naturally, I had to check it out. I had recently discovered The Greeks Grill and their amazing falafel, and I had to see if this place could one-up them. \n\nI was beyond excited for the falafel, but when I walked in, I already knew I was in for a letdown. The service was bad from the start; curt, unhelpful, disinterested. We ordered the baba ganoush, which was alright. Nothing special, but we were hungry. The falafel came and I eagerly took a bite, only to have to force the bite down with water. The falafel was bland and not well prepared (resemblant of mush), and they overcompensated with the hummus and pickles to try to make up for the flavor. \n\nNow, I'm sure they prepare some of their food well, given the amount of positive reviews they have from other Yelpers, but I will never be heading back there.\n\nNeedless to say, we left and got some yummy food to cleanse our taste buds. Definitely sticking with The Greeks Grill for all further falafel excursions."
1,"The food is excellent and the service is perhaps the best I have gotten anywhere. The wait staff is very attentive. When I finished my first glass of tea, the glass barely hit the table before someone was picking it up to refill. Same thing when the check was brought to the table."
0,"Heath Schneider may be the most incompetent loan officers I've ever encountered!  \n\nHe just cost & lost a wonderful home purchase for me,  all the while reassuring me he was 99.9% certain our transaction would close on time!  Not only did we not close on time,  his tactics used up all of our grace period to the point that the seller was so disgusted with us, they wouldn't allow us to come in with ALL CASH ( hard money) if they would have granted an additional extension!  To say that Mr. Schneider's methodology alienated the seller is a mild understatement.  Fortunately for us, they gave us our deposit back and basically told us we had wasted enough of their time.  I hate to say it, but Heath misunderstood and misrepresented our transaction so badly, all the while acting as a sophomoric cheering section with encouragement of our impending closure!!  I would caution anyone considering doing business with Golden Bear Capital and Heath Schneider!!   We almost bought a fantastically undervalued home in a multi million dollar neighborhood....and should have had the keys by now!!  Heath literally blew it for us and I'm not feeling all warm and fuzzy about it!  BUYER BEWARE!!"
1,"We have been here a few time with a crowd and I have to admit, it is a pretty damn good time!  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars, it is so freakin loud in this place that it is hard to hear your peeps!  You have to shout in everyone's ear, but after a few Smithwick's it doesn't matter anymore.  Haven't tried the food yet, but hands down I give it up to this place as being one of the top Pub's in the East Valley!  Check it out."
0,"R-I-P-O-F-F\n\nThe service was excellent - that's a very major pro.\n\nHowever, I expect that when I pay about $100 a person.\n\nBetter comparables include:\n\nMorton's\nRuth's Chris\nMastro's\nFleming's \n\nheck - maybe Lone Star.\n\nSeriously - I still can't figure out the theme or the goal of this place - other than it's in a great hotel and pictures of Emeril's food was everywhere.\n\nPass."
1,"My bf LOVES this place. We frequent it quite a bit. The buns are fresh, the meat is delicious, and the sides you get to add on yourself. Favorites are elk burger now, (it's new) but buffalo and ostrich burger were past favorites. Make sure you douse it with the nacho cheese sauce. Oh and the tricked out nachos, firehouse boneless buffalo wings, and oreo shake are pretty good too. The one located in the New Orleans casino is open 24 hours but the one that is on Flamingo closes at 11pm. It's a little pricey for a burger about $8 and they also have a breakfast menu that starts at 2am to 11am which I'd like to try one day."
1,"If you live in or by planet Hollywood, you must go to Earl of Sandwiches for a $6 sandwich!! It's awesome. I tried the club, full monague, and tuna melt. I must say my favorite was the tuna melt. It doesn't come with anything but the melted cheese and tuna goodness on a toasty bread bun, but you can ask them to add lettuce and tomato for free! \n\nI loved their soups too. Tomato bisque and broccoli cheddar were both delicious. I think over our weekend in Vegas, for every meal and late night snack, our group of 16 always had someone that went to Earl's. It's quick, cheap, and good! It's open 24 hours too. \n\nAlmost makes it ok that we stayed so far down the strip from grand lux :)"
1,"The place was very nice. The food there had the good stuff. Seabass (but taste wise wasn't that great), King Crab etc. Compare this place to  the Bellagio's buffet, Bellagio was better. But the quality of food is better at the Winn's. I was surprise that there's not as many people here I had to wait in a huge line at the Bellagio."
0,"Something has happened to MTO. The service is not up to par, with wait staff rolling their eyes when you ask a question, or like today when my ketchup bottle was taken away when I was still using it. The manager promised to wipe down the table and bring us utensils, which didn't happen until after our food arrived. And what's up with Kool-Aid? It's a fun drink and yet they never have any. Lots of excuses about why they never have it, but no one ever seems to figure out how to stock it. This is probably my key point: systems seem in short supply at MTO. As for the food, today I ordered the Vegan Falafel, which came in a wrap. Flavorful falafel strips with lettuce, tomato and a vinegrette dressing. It made a good salad when the wrap fell apart with the first bite. I planned to take the leftovers with me. I changed my mind when my go box was a thin paper box with no foil or wax paper to keep it from leaking. I just left the box and the remainder of the meal; too risky to return to work with leaking vinegrette. Finally, my waitress couldn't work the register. Again, systems, training, and a better go box, would improve the experience."
1,"WOW 5 stars for KA!!! I love Cirque du Soleil shows, but this is the best one yet!! This show has more of a story line than others, but stays true to the acrobatic background. The stage and set was amazing, it alone is worth the money. The seats were comfy and I liked the speakers in the headrest. We had perfect seats lower section row L, right in the middle of everything. You could feel the heat of the fire. \n\nMy husband did not want to see this, but  I made him go with me. After the show he was glad we went, he loved it and even recommended it to others!!!\n\nOf course tickets can be pricey, but they do give 30% military discounts !!!(only at KA box office inside MGM)\n\nThis show was awesome, I hope to see it again!!!!"
0,"Don't expect anything fast or served efficiently at this place! Still waiting at 50 minute mark for a burger while other customers walk out the door!\n\nSave yourself from this experience!\n\nBurgers finally arrived 75 minutes later after 11pm!\n\nNo plans on returning, in fact I will picket outside if given the opportunity.\n\nCouldn't even get a glass of water for 20 minutes.\n\nIf I had a camera you would see everyone walking out!"
1,Service at the bar from Sarah was exceptional! She did a great job making sure our drinks were full and checked on our meal.  She earned Damon's an extra star for her service and giving me extra lettuce.\n\nThe club sandwich was average.  I can't praise it nor put it down.  It was aight!
0,"Came here out of convenience...\n\n\nPharmacy had me wait 30 minutes told me my prescription was 80 went to pick it up and it was magically $130 \n\n\nMisinforming patients and showed no concern for their lack of knowledge, stick to the real pharmacies not a company trying to maximize income"
1,"Agree this is the best of the Serrano's locations, and that the Val Vista and guadelupe location is the worst.  The bean dip is always warm and tasty, chips almost always hot and salted reasonably.  For the last 5 years the chicken tortilla soup and albondigas have never, ever been less than superb.  In terms of food, service, ambience this is really 3 stars, but for being so damn consistent over the years gotta give this one a 4."
1,"i just start my membership about a month ago, i love it so far, everyone is very nice and friendly, Vadim and Todd are the BOMB!!! great instructors!! i already feel i'm stronger, cant wait to see the result after a year....if you want to have a great work out, this is the place you should come!!!!!!"
0,"2.4/5  - How can you make Mexican food without any flavor?\n\nOrdered the BBQ pork burrito. Heard a lot about and read a lot of great reviews about this amazing BBQ pork. Turns out it is shredded pork with a very bland ketchup/honey sauce on it. I understand it's a chain and you aren't going to smoke the pork or anything that would add flavor during the cooking process but to skimp out and get the cheapest tasting BBQ sauce? Why even try? The other meat choices are shredded beef, shredded chicken, steak, and grilled chicken. The shredded beef didn't look too bad but the shredded chicken was sitting in a bunch of grey water and looked like it came out of a tuna can. \n\nThe employees screwed up my order a little bit, but I forgive them due to the environment they have to work in. When someone orders extra meat or cheese they all have to scream \""extra meat\"" or \""macho man\"" or something else incredibly obnoxious that I couldn't understand. You can see by their face they are miserable doing it and I don't understand who they are doing it for. Does a customer exist who takes great pride in everyone within earshot knowing the standard is just not enough for them? If the owner or manager of the restaurant is reading this review, KNOCK IT OFF! It's not funny, clever, or whatever else you think it is. \n\nIf you are looking for better quality Mexican food in the same price range first go to Baja Fresh (or Una Mas in the Bay Area), then Qdoba, then Chipotle.  On the way back I thought about whether there is any reason I would ever go back. The only thing I could come up with is if you really want BBQ and your wife really wants Mexican and you want to be nice and compromise and get a really crappy BBQ Burrito then maybe you go here."
1,"I had lunch here today for the first time and was very pleased. \n\nGabriela, my server, who I think may also be an owner, was very personable and helpful.  The meal started off with a warm roll accompanied with a great dipping sauce. Then, being my first time, I asked Gabby for suggestions.  She mentioned that the # 19, Peruvian style fajitas, was their most popular dish, so, that's what I ordered. Very satisfied with her suggestion, I will most definitely be back again.\n\nExcellent food. Exceptional service. Authentic, clean restaurant. What more could you ask for?"
1,"Stayed here last week. Beautiful and convenient. The suite is spacious and fancy - marble countertops and such. There was even a remote control for the curtains! Wow! Lots of pillows on the bed, so you can choose flat or fluffy. Only one minor complaint, I realize that the mini-fridge full of overpriced drinks is a standard thing, but I was bit annoyed there wasn't room to shove in my leftover half sandwich from a late night snack. Oh, and the note on the fridge says you will automatically be billed for drinks taken, so no dice on temporarily moving bottles out. \n\nLove the bathroom and bathroom amenities. Glass walled stand-up shower, bathrobes, a nice tub and another TV in there. There was a little box with q-tips, a shower cap and even a mini sewing repair kit. Okay, I didn't need to use it, but it was thoughtful. I was bemused by the phone right next to the toilet. \n\nSituated close to the Venetian, Mirage, Treasure Island, Wynn, and Fashion Show mall. Some construction was going on out but it was no bother. The hotel restaurants were good although typical Vegas pricey- I enjoyed the Canyon Ranch Cafe and Espressamente Illy. Also there's a Walgreens right out front, convenient for getting things like bottled water. \n\nWe took a brief visit to lounge at the pool deck. They offered oranges! I don't like oranges, but it was a nice touch. In all fairness though, the pool boys should be shirtless if the pool girls have to walk around in bikinis and a skirt."
0,"The night club was awesome. We had 10 people go there with us for my daughters 21st Birthday and we were all from California. Here's what I'm really disappointed about. We all arrived there Friday 10/17/2014 @ 10:15pm . We had checked their website and it said on Fridays it was $30 for men and $20 for woman, when we got there they said It was $35 for men and $25 for woman. That's not even the worse part of it, I really didn't care and wasn't going to argue about it. The bad part is, the line was so short and in fact, there was only 8 people ahead of us and it took us over an hour before they let us in. The Gate keeper I would call him came over and told us if we wanted to tip the host $20 per male they would let us in right now and at this point there was only 4 people in front of us. So if we paid this extra $20, we would be @ $430 instead of $310 just to get in the front door. Then at there desertion, they would let people go straight in with no wait or maybe they just had more money than our group and could pay the $'s needed to skip the line. The good part is, that once we got in we spent over $1,000 in drinks and had a blast. The sad part is I would never go back to this club because of there greed. I mean really, you would think that they would be happy you picked their Club for a special night for our daughters 21st and that we traveled all the way from California. When I told the Gate Keeper that it was my daughters 21st, he didn't even seem to care one bit. When we go to Las Vegas for my next daughters 21st, I will make sure if we go to this Club again we contact someone there that actually appreciates your business. People running this club will end up costing the owners money and maybe they already make so much that they really don't care. Great Club, poor Gate Keepers.."
0,"Two small rooms that hold the poker tables. Often filled towards midday and past with little mini-tournaments, the atmosphere here is fun, albeit it can be filled with locals at times, and so going into one of those games can leave you a bit high and dry.\n\nThey do have high hand bonuses, which is nice."
1,"I came here during a company conference a few years ago and now Im making a review because I'll going here again this weekend.  I'll tell you what its the best show i've seen on the strip! Well the fact is that I haven't seen KA, O, Blue Man Group or any other Cirque du Soleil shows in Sin City. This show will mesmerize the mind in some way and it as a fun kick to it.\n\nWhen you first walk inside before ticketing, WOW the lobby corridor is GrooOOVE!!! Psychedelic! its like being in Austin Powers British world, Yeah Baby! now strike a pose and take pics! Make sure you get some of that Strawberry Fields drink at the bar before seating and keep your souvenir cup (I left mine behind the first time).\n\nWe all sat a few rows down from the top on one of those 200 sections, it was easy to see, no matter how far you are because the stage is round.\n\nEarly part of the show your gonna hear the beats thumpin' rolling into the track \""get back\"" it got me bobbin my head. At the start, the music is slow, and soothing and so forth. The performances are great! the Choreography is Cirque Du Soleil splendid! they all flow accordingly of some of the Beatles greatest hits.\n\nBefore all of this, I had little knowledge of Beatle Music and knowing that its my parents teenage years of their generation, was the craze!  I remember seeing some those old Beatles records my dad kept at his childhood home but it must be golden.\n\nI recommend seeing this show, it got me to be a believer that's why I've been wanting to take my woman this time around and that's why I played the Beatles Love CD soundtrack (provided from my company swagbag) like non-stop on our road trip back home from conference and again I played the music soundtrack non-stop on a road trip to Arizona. The music is catchy and it would make you appreciate Beatles Music more after watching this show. It even got me playing Rock Band Beatles on my XBOX 360! for crying out loud!\n\nThis is how i can describe the Beatles Love show at the Mirage: happy,joy,sad,celebrate,and all you need is love..."
1,I had the Serenity massage yesterday and absolutely enjoyed every second. Marica was fabulous! She asked me how the pressure was and knew just where to take a little extra time!\n\nThe Spa is so calm and clean. My room was inviting and the bed was really comfortable. My massage even included a foot scrub. The prices are reasonable and you are really pampered. \n\nThis is my second time here and I highly recommend getting in for a treatment. When I checked in on Yelp I even got an upgraded to include aromatherapy!\n\nThank you to the staff for treating this tired mother to a great hour of relaxation!
1,"I have lived here for four weeks and have been here 3 times already. \n\nHave not gotten a dish I haven't liked yet! My only complaint would be the service, which is slow and a little sloppy, yet redeemed by the servers having great attitudes and being very sweet. \n\nNice decor, clean. Very reasonable price.\n\nI was a little concerned about a bottled beer being out dated.... check those bottles, guys!"
1,Awsome
0,"I had a bad experience here because the service was really bad, we sat down for 10 mins before we called a waitress that was just talking to two other waitresses. She said just a moment and continued talking to them. Finally another waitress came to take our drink order, then she brought everyone's drinks but my water. So I asked again after 15 mins I had to ask again. All in all food was ok but service was really off today. (Mon 3/25/13)"
1,This place is actually really nice. The rooms are well worth it and there's a balcony too.
0,"Came here from LA for a day, and having had amazing food at my own mom'n'pop Cuban food spot at El Criollo and Havana Man\u00eda (shameless plugs for you Vegas peeps visiting the LA area), other than my abuela's house (que en paz descanse), I came here armed with great reviews from local folks (yeah, you guys!) and naturally high expectations... Aaaand left a tad disappointed. The only thing fresh we received was the bread (oh, soo good), the maduros, the guanabana shakes and the avocado salad. Our main course came so fast out of the kitchen after we sat down and ordered, we were amazed... Until I stuck my fork into my chicken fricas\u00e9 (spoiler alert: when I get it at my local spot, the meat is falls-off-the-bone delish!), not only did it not budge off the bone, it tasted like it had been re-heated, and parts of it had the texture of jerky. Not a sign of freshness. Lord knows I've cooked and reheated enough leftover meals in my day to know what happens to chicken when reheated in the microwave. My mom's meal, though it was very tasty, the one bite I had was less than lukewarm. All of these elements going downhill were disappointing, because of our waitress being so friendly and welcoming that it felt like I was coming to my family's house to eat. Though everything else was great, the two stars are strictly based on the main course."
1,"Good location for Scottsdale.  Restaurant is very nice on the inside.  The bar was packed (hey . . . it was on a Friday afternoon).  Sat in the dining room.  Dining room was pretty crowded already.  Lots of folks with small children but the children were behaving fine as it was still early in the evening.  Tourists in tee shirts and shorts.  It was Scottsdale after all and I suppose folks were on vacation.  I had the prime rib because of the earlier reviews I'd read here.  Prime rib was very good.  Just came on a plate with a side of mashed potatoes.  Pretty boring but I was hungry.  I loved the wedge salad.  It was full of blu cheese and bacon.  I'd get that again.  Husband had the crab cakes.  He said it was just OK.  All in all, I'd go back.  But I'd sit in the bar and order off the bar food menu.  One thing I didn't like.  Good service but she brought out our meal about 5 minutes after ordering.  I felt like I was at In n Out inside of having a relaxing meal on a Friday evening."

1,"Stopped here for lunch the other day after walking by dozens of times over the years.  I had 2 slices of pepperoni lunch special.  Pizza was hot and fresh and very good and tasty.  I've been to places where the lunch-slices are sitting out for a while and are like wet cardboard, but  not here.  Will eat here anytime I have a chance!"
1,SO SO accommodating to my gluten sensitivity. I felt at home and not rushed by our waiter who had a perfectly placed french accent. By far the best part of my visit to Las Vegas.
0,"i have to drop another star on this update and here's why. the major surgery i mentioned in my last update (ACL repair) turned out to be a tad on the extreme end of the treatment scale. \n\nthe way the diagnosis and treatment was presented to me was: surgery and rehabilitation (by a paid therapist, not on your own) -- end of story. and if you don't do the surgery, she will eventually blow out her other knee(s) because she not putting weight on the injured one. i was pressured to schedule tests to prep her for said surgery and the idea of surgery at all was just so nonchalant. in fact the dr said he's done this surgery on both of his own dogs and does these types of surgeries on dogs all the time and this injury is quite common. it was somehow alarmist and blase at the same time.\n\nI dont' doubt that that is all true (including the possibility of injury to other knees), but a bit misleading in the way that this is a major, major surgery with major, major recovery time. Also, after doing my own research and finding out that this was 1. going to be anywhere from a $3k-$5k surgery, and 2. it's not at all as \""absolutely necessary as i was led to believe, I felt this was not at all a good choice for such an aged dog.\n\nso after researching it a bit on my own i felt a little upset about not being informed about the other ways you can treat this (your own rehab efforts, meds like phycox and hylox). only when i called to cancel dozer's follow up appt for tests to prep her for this surgery did Finch call back to recommend the \""DIY\"" rehab tips. (And he does personally call back to check in on your pet after appts, new meds have been started, etc., which i think is great.)\n\nIn fact, I have always liked Dr. Finch, and i don't know that he's deserving of the other reviewer's remarks (come on: smelling of alcohol on the job? please. and his demeanor hardly seems capable of rude or rough) - he's not unprofessional or uncaring, and his manner is rather soothing, but i just feel that trust has been majorly broken. \n\nnot to mention at a previous appt before this whole ACL business he spent five minutes going on and on about this revolutionary new dog food that's great for joints (dozer also has bad hips) even though i kept interrupting him to say we weren't interested in it, all while staring at a huge poster ad for the food behind his head on the cabinet.\n\nafter these last two incidences, which have made me think back on still other minor ones, i feel that their priorities are a little out of order, and am now in the market for a new vet."
1,"Can't believe it's taken so long for me to comment on Shampoo Ink and my stylist Heidi!  I've made so many changes to my hair over the year from blonde to red to transitioning back to blonde and every change we've done I've received so many compliments.  It's hip but not too trendy to intimidate anyone.  I even recommended my boyfriend to give it a try for a professional cut and he loved the extra treatment he received from Heidi.  Heidi never pushes product, but will make suggestions when I need something.  Love this place and would suggest Heidi to anyone that needs a new stylist!"
1,I went to gourmet for my moms b day to surprise her ! I was making a dinner for my moms b day and I thought it would be cool to get some gourmet popcorn in as apps. Everyone loved it !! the banana and the chilli flavored popcorn is a must !! The white chocolate is my favorite ! Glad you are in las vegas !!
0,"Meh. \n\nBasically describes it. Food, service, and drinks are all mediocre. I tried a Daiquiri and it was disgusting, I'm pretty sure it was just rum with  a few strawberries and NOTHING else. The computer chairs are terrible to sit in and awkward if on a date, I'd recommend booking online or going early to get the lounge chairs with trays.\nHowever, even those are not the most comfortable. I go back purely because they have a lot of Groupons, probably to draw in more business as I see and agree the reviews aren't very good. I'd recommend AMC Esplanade over Studio Movie Grill or even IPic if you are looking to dine while you watch a movie."
1,"It is rare when I find myself on the north side of town. On occasion I do happen to drive through. I try to avoid it after dark at all costs since it is not the best area. I was a bit surprised when I saw this little gem, there are a lot of empty spaces in the shopping center but they were busy enough that I decided to give them a try.\n\nWhen I pulled up to the drive through , I was amazed at the huge menu. Reminded me of home sweet home (California). I wanted to sample everything off the menu but I had to practice self control. I ended up with the chili cheese burger combo and boy it did not disappoint. I gobbled that combo up within 5 minutes and was left wanting more, so what do you do when that happens? You go back for more!\n\nI went back the following morning to sample their breakfast. Steak and eggs, pancakes, and the pastrami burger. Oh and the sauce, don't let me forget about their burger sauce, it is amazing, definitely gives the burgers a great taste!It all was very good, the hash was very crispy but it was too plain, that is my only complain. Other than that, everything else was very good. Definitely worth the drive across town in my opinion."
1,"This is a business plan that was always going to work - lingerie and a caf\u00e9. Both girls and guys are going to love it. To be fair it is actually really good and is more than just a novelty. Found in the West End, it is slightly off the main shopping streets but worth the detour. \n\nPrimarily it is a lingerie shop, and it has a good selection of pretty, dare I say it rauchy, stuff. Obviously as a guy, and a non-transvestite, I have a different criteria of what makes underwear hot, and Boobytrap delivers. Not quite as provocative (let's be frank slutty) as Ann Summers, think more La Senza - sexy but with a touch more class. No crotchless knickers here or nipple tassles. \n\nAs well as this, we have the unusual addition of a caf\u00e9. Whether all the raunchiness has left you feeling a bit weak at the knee, or are a girl chatting about what to buy, or simply a guy way way out of his depth, the caf\u00e9 is a place to chill out. They do a good range of teas, coffees and sandwiches which you can enjoy before heading off for round two.\n\nAn individul and enjoyable place to spend about half an hour, whether as a couple or on your own (buying gifts, not perving - I am not endorsing this)."
0,"Literally shit. Do yourself a favor and go to the food court in Palms, because the Chinese food here is horrible. \n\nFirst, we ordered the pho, expecting some sort of resemblance to the savory Vietnamese noodle dish familiar to our (admittedly) spoiled taste buds. Unfortunately, the noodles were too thick, the broth had no flavor, and the temperature was lukewarm. \n\nNext, we got the orange chicken, which was worse than Panda Express's. Once again, it was cooked to a lukewarm temperature, but the texture of the chicken made it apparent that it was bought from Costco or something. \n\nFinally, to everyone familiar with Chinese/Taiwanese hotpot: it's not hotpot. A more appropriate title would have been \""beef stew.\""\n\nBtw it's really expensive without Palms club membership."
1,"I work near by and have had stopped in here for lunch several times. Always delicious and always a great experience. \nThis is a small store front with an extremely courteous staff and just plain great food! Sandwiches made to order... bread (especially the croissants) with so much flavor and baked just right! And price wise... a much better deal or at least comparable to the famous chain sandwich shops (Subway... bleh!). \nA few weeks ago a coworker mentioned that they also have breakfast so being that I had my staff working on a Saturday I agreed to buy breakfast... HUGE sandwiches with eggs, cheese and a meat (bacon, pork sausage or turkey sausage.) all on your choice of bread... All for as little as $1.99 (50 cents extra for a croissant.) So yummy and so filling! This was a big hit with the staff for sure and really... I got off pretty cheap considering that we fed a total 8 people for right around $20. Much cheaper than the local burrito place and better food then hitting the local drive thru! \nNow on to the desserts... WOW! Passion Fruit mousse cake!!! My personal favorite...Awesome! Not to sweet but definitely worth splurging those extra calories. \nTony (the manager) and his staff are always extremely friendly, courteous and willing to help questions and suggestions. \n\nDefinitely recommend this place..."
0,"This was the biggest nightmare I have ever had with a shop.  My car had a fairly simple repair.  We called and were told to go buy the part and they would put it in.  We did and paid the labor.  Five minutes after driving away the Service Engine light came on, which has never happened before.  My husband called the shop and the sweet guy at the front was so apologetic and said they would of course fix it and make it right.  My husband drove it straight back to the shop and they hooked up diagnostics to it to see what the problem was.  Of course it was the part they had just installed.  They took out the part again and tried to tell us that the part we had just bought was bad.  The sweet mechanic even said that it was possible that it got bumped in installation.  Adam told us we never should have bought the part ourselves and that it was all our fault.  Adam is the owner and started hopping around and talking in circles.  We told him that we did exactly as we were told by the employee at the front.  He even got the employee on speaker phone and he openly admitted to telling us that they would repair the car, as they should.  If it was a bad part, then don't install it and we'll get a different one!  He wanted us to stay overnight and then pay more than double for a different brand part the next day and said that we would have to pay labor again as well.  He would not give us a quote.  When I disagreed with him and said that it was not fair to have to pay labor again he flipped out at me and started cussing me out.  Saying he was the only one that was willing to help me.  He removed the part and refused to put it in again.  He left us there with the seats removed from our car and the entire gas tank exposed.  He literally pushed our car out of the shop and refused service.  He had no problem leaving us there stranded with our family at night in the alley way.  I could not believe it!  Unfortunately the workers there are all very sweet and seemed to be ruled by his iron fist in fear, so they don't feel like they can disagree with him.  I truly believe that had Adam not been there, they would have fixed my car properly and sent me on my way without further charge.\nSome angels happened to find us and help us replace the part so we could leave that nightmare.  \nDo not go to this shop!  The employees are awesome, but unfortunately it is owned by a completely dishonest, unethical tyrant.  Avoid Adam at all cost."
1,Get a hair cut and a nice close shave. I like the shaving cream warmer.
1,"I'm so glad I finally gave Rollin Smoke a try and that I didn't go here by myself as I would've driven away. The location isn't that great. It's close to a strip club, adult stores, etc. Tits and BBQ - this is a man's restaurant. The BBQ aroma fills the air inside the restaurant and sticks to your hair and clothes (had to shampoo my hair twice).\n\nThe food was amazing!  I'm not the biggest fan of ribs so, for me to like this place is a major deal. We had a meat Trio: brisket, pork and ribs with waffle fries and Mac n cheese. I liked everything we got. The meats were tender, juicy and smokey. I poured some house BBQ sauce on the meats for more flavor. The waffle fries were very crispy and I wanted to order more. The Mac n cheese has a smokey taste to it as well but was runny...still damn good though. The chicken sandwich and a black berry cobbler were ok.\n\nThis is not a fast-food restaurant so, expect to wait about 20 minutes or more to get your food. It's worth the wait."
1,"My husband and I are locals in Las Vegas, and have visited many restaurants on the strip. Sushi Samba is one that we had been waiting to try, and it lived up to all of our expectations. From the minute we were seated by the hostess to the end of our dinner, the experience was wonderful. The ambiance of the restaurant is very modern and fun. Our waiter was very knowledgable about all the food and beverages. Throughout our dinner he took the time to explain all the dishes to us as they came out. My husband had a Sake, and I tried their signature Samba juice, both drinks were very good. We tried a little bit of everything from appetizers to entrees. The food was delicious! The sushi would rate among the best that we ever had. Their menu is a fusion of Brazilian and Japanese, so they had some very different items to choose from that you don't see at other Japanese restaurants. We also had a chance to meet Chef Joel as he walked around the restaurant. He was very personable, and took the time to talk with my husband and I. He explained to us about some of the dishes that were on the menu, and you could see the passion he had for the food. It makes us really excited to go back and try more! The excellent serve we received, the exciting environment, and the delicious food makes for a wonderful experience. This is one restaurant I think should be tried by all that come to Las Vegas!"
1,This was one of the best dinners I've had out in a long time.  We had the zucchini fries and pimento cheese small plates to start.  Both were wonderful!! I got a mushroom burger which was awesome and he had the trout which was delicious.  And for dessert we ate the chocolate mouse which again was perfect.  We are definitely coming back again.  The staff was pleasant and I couldn't be happier with our experience.
0,"I went in for a pedicure, thinking I would have a more luxurious experience than I normally do at a nail salon. It wasn't a horrible experience, Crystal was very nice and did a good (but not great) job. What has me at less than 5 stars is the fact that the place is immaculately styled and kept EXCEPT the area for nails. They clearly treat this service as an afterthought. They desperately need to update their chairs for pedicure services, a picture from a year ago showing a broken remote is still accurate(!!) and neither chair seems to work for anything but making bubbles... Also, I really thought they would have what was needed to take care of my feet based on the description of pedi services. I was a little disappointed with the results but I can cut some slack considering I know my feet were in poor shape coming in. Sorry to say I won't be back."
0,"First off, you should know that I am a waffle snob. Waffles are something of a tradition in my family, and I have VERY strong opinions about them. \n\nThe husband got the famous fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was fine. The waffles were not. Heavy, doughy, flabby and lukewarm: these were very sad waffles indeed. Come to think of it, they were pretty much the opposite of a waffle in every respect. \n\nI was wary of the waffles to begin with and ordered the corned beef hash instead. The scrambled eggs that came with the dish were well prepared. The hash felt....um....assembled. I'm betting the dish was made by putting down a layer of fried potatoes in a skillet, throwing on some onions, peppers, and shredded corned beef, then piling on some swiss cheese and running the whole thing under a broiler. In no way were the ingredients saut\u00e9ed together, which is what makes a hash a hash. This was just a pile. \n\nThe server was friendly and attentive, if a bit unctuous."
0,"Run from this buffet!!!!! The food looks like its been sitting there for weeks. You couldn't PAY me to eat the food. The only thing I can say is the staff is very nice and friendly. If you wanna make many trips to the bathroom , then is the food for u. Stick with taco bell. Its safer. Hey I dont want to be mean here, but its pretty hard to NOT lose your appetite while looking at the different selections of entrees. YELP!!!!!!! I must say we ate the rest of the time at the Victory club and the award winning mexican restaurant and they were fine....reasonable and the food was decent. The complete opposite. Stay away from the buffet unless you loose all your money in the casino and you are in need of food. Then and ONLY then would I even attempt to eat there. If you do, good luck and make sure you are near the bathroom the rest of the day!!!!"
0,"Omg worst service ever. Walked in with my Family ready to order while the girls their were just chatting and laughing talking about \""boobs\"". Finally one turned back and walked over to take our order. \""Didn't look to happy no smile no hi\"" anyways all the tables were dirty and the drink station was full of a mixture of soda and ketchup! I told one of the employees if she can please wipe a table down for me and wow she just smeared the table and walked away. Geee thanks! Never coming back that's for sure"
0,"I would give this place no stars or negative stars if possible. Horrible service, place is filthy, and the wait time is ridiculous! What a joke. For that price you think you were getting gourmet food! I got a stale, wilted salad and a overseasoned, soggy chicken fraco. And their \""specialty\"" drink, is juice with club soda so they can charge an arm and a leg?!!! Never again!"
1,"These are the best tacos I've ever had! The only problem I had was with the service. There was only one waiter, though there were two people cleaning. The food came out 10 minutes after we ordered, but when it came, my brother and I agreed that it was worth the wait. We came for a light lunch, so we got two tacos each. They are individually priced, so you need to think about how much you want to eat. I got the carne asada and the standard tacos. They were perfectly made and I was enjoying them so much! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants some high-quality Mexican food."
0,"Overpriced.  The food is decent, but when you consider that you're paying $20 (or more) for every mediocre entree, it makes the food that much less enjoyable."
1,"TOGO's is about as good as it gets for a \""franchise\"" sandwich, and this location in particular is the best one I've ever been to. It's huge, well-run, with very friendly service, fast when busy, and consistent in quality & quantity. About a million times better than Subway, and a far better value as you actually get a reasonable amount of meat in your sandwich, unlike the other guys, where you get about a metric ton of lettuce and other fluff ingredients, hiding some wafer-thin slices of generic grocery case cold cuts. Give it a try if you've never been, you won't be disappointed."
0,"I had an appointment to see a vehicle on Saturday at 10:15 am, this was confirmed Friday evening also by them. On Saturday morning I drove the hour and forty five minutes to see the vehicle that they had advertised. To my very surprise, it happened to had been sold that morning and, no one bothered to call me. They stated in their ad that you make a VIP appointment and they will have the vehicle available. I believe that the vehicle did not even exist and they just wanted me in there to sell me something else. This is the worst experience with a dealership I have ever had. The manager could care less and the Internet person lied that she tried to call me 30 minutes prior to my arrival which is absolutely absurd!! Does anyone care what happened, NO. I would warn everyone to watch doing business with this dealership , something shady going on here."
0,"Been eating here since it converted from the old buffet. I was totally convinced that I had found the best Chinese restaurant in the area. The food was really tasty and I had been treated well by the wait staff and owner. That all changed yesterday. I had lunch here for the last time. When I walked in, the manager sat me...I was 1 of 2 customer's in the joint. I ordered and waited for my food. Customer #3 walks in and is seated right behind me. He orders his meal without rice - extra veggies. Waitress responds like he's weird, \""You don't want rice?\"" The waitress goes to the owner and they speak for awhile. He comes back with her and they ask the customer to explain his order. \""I don't eat rice. I just want fish & black bean sauce, but put extra vegetables, please.\"" Easy enough to understand, but they go on to question why he don't like rice! PLEASE! The man don't eat rice...cook him some food! Owner says, \""OK, but that will be extra...\"" FOR WHAT?!! I blow that off, smh and mind my business, eat my meal and my waiter asks if I want more ice tea. I said, \""Sure, thanks. But can I get it in a to-go cup?\"" He goes back to the owner and then sends the waitress back to explain that today its cool but I would have to buy my FREE refill next time! FOR WHAT?!! SHEEESH! Really? I understand times are hard, and saving money is pretty important. However, seeing that the joint was SO NOT CROWDED, wouldn't it be wise to treat your loyal customers (if not all of them) with some hospitality & grace? Good Luck Mr. South China owner...keep doing business this way and I promise YOUR BUSINESS WILL TANK! NO SOUP FOR YOU!"
0,"Bad experience here tonight. Three of us ordered burgers all cooked the same - medium. Mine came late and after I got one bite in, I saw burger was raw on inside. I sent it back. Rather than cook a new one they put the raw one back on grill, seared the edges and brought it back. They literally threw it on the table and quickly left table. After a bite, I saw it was still raw at center. I couldn't get anyone's attention and my guests were almost finished. Staff avoided checking with me again. Bad"
1,"One of my biggest gripes lately has been regarding price; while I fully expect a burger in a strip location to cost upwards of $15, I find it very hard to pay up when there are amazing choices for under $5 in albeit locations of not the greatest ambiance. It is this reason that I got excited the other day while reading a little blurb on Eater Vegas about a burger deal at the Palm Restaurant in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. The starting price was still almost twice the price of some stand out cheap meals I've had, but could this discount help out?\n\nI've already gotten into how much I hate parking at Caesar's so I won't get into that again. I didn't really step foot into the restaurant past the hostess counter because I sat on their 'patio' to people watch tourists in the mall while I ate my burger. It seemed dark, intimate and 'fancy' if you will; you can probably find better information in their gallery than from me. The patio area has about 14 tables directly within the shopping corridor and really does make for great people watching as you eat, or if you're cocky to be seen eating here. The lunch and dinner menus vary quite a bit, with only one burger available on the dinner menu at over $18. The lunch menu gives you the choice of four specialty burgers at $16.90, and a basic one at $14.90.\n\nI went with the 837 Club Burger which as prosciutto di Parma, roasted red peppers, pesto aioli and fontina cheese. My burger came out, and it was huge. So big that I actually slowed down a bit towards the end despite being absolutely starving coming into my meal. The meat had excellent flavor, was cooked almost to order although there were a few random spots of grey. The Peppers had great flavor and the burger was very cheesy and tasty. The aioli was sharp and also very good. The bun was a tiny bit too thick and dry, but was well proportioned to the meat so it ended up being ok. The accompanying lettuce, tomato and onions were not necessary as the various tasty toppings did the trick.\n\nThe fries were excellent too; seasoned and cooked well with some a bit undercooked and some crispy. A good variety of textures with none being bad. This was a welcome addition to my meal after encountering so many great burgers with bad fries around town. My normally $16.90 burger cost me $8.37 which I found to be a fantastic deal for what I was given. Even at almost $17 I probably wouldn't have complained too much for the quality, although once you start comparing it to others that cost a fraction of the price you can certainly make arguments against it. Either way, if you happen to be at the Forum Shops this is a great burger."
0,"Rude & slow customer service, dirty cars, not worth saving a few $$$."
0,"The hotel itself is conveniently located in the center of the strip and the no-frills rooms are fairly modern and well-maintained, minus the phones. Since there is no WIFI (yep), make sure you add the personal hotspot option to your cell phone service so you won't be without internet service for the duration of your trip. Diamond Club check-in is pointless, for those wondering. It still took me 20 minutes to check in because they only had two desks open.\n\nNow, on to the food, which is the primary factor leading to my 1-star rating.\n\nEvery year, my company holds a week-long convention at this hotel and since I'm hard at work, I rarely get to leave. I'm lucky if I get to eat one meal outside of Harrah's. Up until this year, I would pretty much survive off room service and Ming's Table, which is now gone, thanks to the brand new Fulton Street Food Hall which looks nice, but with the exception of their slow-as-shit salad bar, is pretty much useless to me.\n\nThis year, I was forced to order room service more than previous years and I was shocked... SHOCKED... at it's drastic decline. First of all, they now stop serving breakfast at 11am.\n\nWHO THE FUCK WAKES UP BEFORE 11AM IN VEGAS????????\n\nSo remember... if you're rolling in from the club, drunk as fuck at 6am... congratulations! You can get your mushroom omelet, you lucky son-of-a-bitch. Secondly, they have scaled down the room service menu so substantially since last year that your only food options between 11am and 11pm are all pre-made sushi ($17-20 per roll), pre-made sandwiches ($12-16 with no sides), or pizza ($20). They have a couple salads on the menu, but since those are pre-made too, don't bother asking if you can add chicken to the Caesar salad because the answer is no. Between 11pm and 6am, your room service food options are... nothing. They're closed. \n\nI tried ordering the roast beef wrap twice and both times, they were out of them. However, one of those times, the woman who took my order called me back after 20 minutes of ordering to deny me. The pizza (which comes from the Fulton Street Food Hall) was an oversauced, practically cheeseless disaster. If you must order food via room service between 11am and 11pm, go for the Italian panini ($16) which was the only decent item they served me all week. If you want a side of fries with it though, that'll cost ya an extra $9.\n\nPhilip, the guy who delivered my food up to me 9 out of 10 times, was as friendly and pleasant as could be, and this room service review is in no way a dig on him.\n\nI used to enjoy ordering a burger from KGB or even a steak or pasta dish up to my room. What a disappointment.\n\nA year ago, I probably would have given Harrah's three stars. I've heard my company has yet to renew our contract with them for next year and I sincerely hope we decide not to."
1,"Fun, wonderful food and an amazing beer selection. Our waiter had excellent knowledge of the food and the beer, and made our visit great. I will definitely eat here again, if we ever visit LV again."
1,"On the hunt for some shelving for the Baby M's nursery, we made the trip out to Chandler yesterday to check out this Pottery Barn Kids.  \n\nAs the other reviews say, this place is super-cute albeit very pricey.  They have a decent selection although we're going for bright white and their \""white\"" is more creme / antique off white, so that is not going to work for us.  The service was not the friendliest either, but I'm going to take into consideration that we were there on a Saturday afternoon and they were jam packed. \n\nBefore I schlep out to Chandler to this PBK store in the future, I'll likely do my research online on their website.  But if price isn't an issue and you're looking for super cute kids' furniture and decor items, you can't go wrong at PBK!"
0,"I tried XO Nails because it was so close to my house, but the disgustingly dirty floors should have been my first indication that it wouldn't be the best manicure I'd ever recieve.\n\nI asked for the gel nails and they barely cleaned up my cuticles and used the same tools they used on a client before me. They were extremely sloppy with the polish and didn't clean up the excess gel surrounding my nails. This is a pet peeve, especially with gels because of how it dries. Three days later, the polish is already peeling off...unlike other salons I've been to where my gels stay on for 2-3 weeks.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm never going back."
0,"Won't be back...ever.  Phoenix had a lot of messy rain this week and we all wanted to go to the car wash.  Today when I went for the quick $5.00 wash I was told by a teenager waiting at the entrance that the $5 quick wash was 'unavailable' but they could perform a full service wash.  Only one way to interpret this: Greed.  I didn't have time for their wash or high pressure sales tactics to upsell me on a myriad of overpriced products that they 'wheel and deal' on once you show disinterest.  So I went up the road 1.5 minutes to Snappy Car Wash.  They were open and glad to wash my vehicle in the quick wash for $5.00.  Also like Gary B, I have 'over waited' in the past with my car sitting there and no one coming in to announce it was ready after a detail - even though they took my name down and said my name would be called when ready.  Just say no."
0,"The inside of Morels is nice, classy and bright white/black decor.  If you are hung over, caution, you may need sunglasses.\n\nThe service is also good except we never got offered bread to start the meal. Anyway, I hardly judge a restaurant by service or looks alone or what the wait staff did or didn't forget to bring.  \n\nThe crab benedict was a delight to look at.  The taste was also pretty good.  Fresh crabs, a delightful citrus hollandaise.  However, the poached egg was cooked solid.  The yolk was not running at all, and last time I checked, a perfectly poached egg has runny yolk.  That is a definitely cooking faux pas.  Unforgivable.\n\nDefinitely headed to Bouchon instead, next time."
0,"I love their pizza, but I tried to call to pick up a pizza tonight and was put on hold.  For 5 minutes!  I thought they forgot about me, so I called back and was asked to hold again.  I told them I wanted to order a pizza and was already on hold for 5 minutes.  I was told, \""well, could you just hold for a couple of minutes longer?\"" and was promptly put on hold again.  I gave up.  They got issues . . ."
1,"super awesome sushi. get the cucumber rolls, they're the bomb! also the rice wrap sushi is amazing. great service & fabulous food. the only reason they're not getting 5 stars is their bathroom was nasty, no toilet paper, just a kleenex box."
1,"Good, quick food. Especially enjoy the breakfast burritos on a lazy weekend. Right down the street so its convenient and its been clean every time Ive visited. Will be back!"
1,"Pizza has returned to Vistancia! And it couldn't have come sooner in my opinion. I missed the pizza place that previously occupied this space (R.I.P Grande) if only for the option to have pizza and wings close by. What's better is I read some chatter online that said this was to be a sister location to the venue at 59th Avenue and the 101. I had been there before and was very happy with my trip. Things were looking up.\n\nImmediately coming through the door the feel is very different considering what was in this exact location not too long ago. It was warm, inviting, and very pizza joint. You walk up to the counter with the menu hanging up behind it and just start reading left to right. The first thing that I noticed was the variety. Stevie's has sandwiches, wings, calzones, pizza, a list of other things, and something they simply call \""Rolls\"". These rolls are really intriguing in their simplicity. It appears to be a sort of cannoli made of dough, cheese, and your choice of fillers such as broccoli, sausage, pepperoni, and a couple of other choices. There are a couple of televisions which not surprisingly had sports playing as well. It was a really good feel. The place being very busy in the first week of their opening had a good vibe as well.\n\nMy family went with a sausage, mushroom pizza, 10 barbecue wings, 10 mild wings, and an order of garlic knots. With as busy as it was, the food came pretty quick. It came to the table hot and smelling great. The wings were really good. I take my wings a little crispy and these were a little shy of that, but pretty good. The flavor was pretty spot on albeit a little warm for mild. The barbecue was just my style. A little tangy and full of flavor. The garlic knots were buttery and loaded with garlic. Not to much for this guy, but some might not appreciate that much. Then there was the pizza. This is touted as New York Style Pizza so I will let you decide. It is a thinner slice with smaller more numerous pieces of toppings which were mushroom and sausage in my case. The mushrooms were fresh and the sausage had good flavor. What it didn't have was excessive grease and a fold-able flex. It was baked pretty crispy and kept a good shape while I ate it. I know some like a nice greased up fold-able slice like Grande used to serve. I respect that, but I prefer this style. It was a darn good pie and we all enjoyed it.\n\nHere is the other cent of the two I've got. Ranch. Some call it a sin to dip one's pizza or wings in ranch. I am an occasional dipper. A social dipper. I am not addicted, I swear. I can stop any time I want. Stevie's ranch is a little too much on the buttermilk side and comes in the small cups. I am a big fan of the thicker less oily ranch in the big cups (Barro's is my benchmark on this subject). If you are a purist, disregard my insolence. I know not what I say. \n\nI have to admit, I was mentally comparing Stevie's to the pizza shop that was in this location before. I couldn't resist it. You walk into the same space and your mind can't help but want to see something it had previously. That was a very good thing in this case. The service is so much better, the ambiance is much more welcoming, the prices are super reasonable, and the refills are free! I am very glad that another pizza joint took up the spot of the old. It is just the thing Vistancia needed in my opinion. My gripes are small but my smile is big. Welcome to Vistancia, Stevie's!"
0,"Used to love this place...went here tonight and they are horribly understaffed. I know it's not the employees fault but it took about 10 min just to have someone come to the front to take our order. Out of 6 orders they messed up on 2. The employees were very friendly and apologetic,  but that doesn't make up for it. A lady at another table took her burger back up to the front because it was served raw. We have been here at least 5 times and unless things drastically change back to the way they used to be, we will not be returning. Buns were soggy...fries were over salty...and everything just seemed sloppy :("
1,"The Wicked Spoon buffet is the best buffet I've ever ate at Las Vegas.\nCustomer service is more than what you could ask for.\nMs.Lisa was our server and was outstanding.\nWith many food varieties, it is hard to choose what to eat.\nThey have a little but of everything from Asian cuisine to fresh seafood\nThe dessert was heaven in my mouth.\nBottom line is the Wicked Spoon buffet is the best Vegas has to offer."
1,"Since Tryst used to be one of my fav Vegas clubs I had to check out XS! When we got to the club (myself +3 girls) the line was FREAKIN Insane on a Friday around 12am. We made our way to the front to see if there was anyway to bypass the line! The door guys at XS are tough cookies! After talking to 3 of the door guys we finally found one who agreed that we shouldn't wait in the long line:) Unfortunately, we didn't get away with free cover:( But jumping the line definitely saved us at least an hour! \n\nThis club is HUGE and gorgeous! Everyone was dressed to impress and looked amazing! The club also has a cool pool where you can sit and waddle your feet in...not sure how safe it is dealing with drunk chicks, but it's a cool feature. \n\nOn the downside, the DJ was kind of wack. The entire night consisted of mash-ups. From what I heard, Saturday nights have better music. We ended up staying till about 3:30ish. XS is one of the better clubs in Vegas and by far the most unique!"
1,"LOVED THE cute in this place:-) Went here on a date.. its coolio for that.. HOWEVER, I didnt care for the pizza we had... and its not to say the other pizzas arent better! I had the Pesto, my 'date' ordered.. I just thought the combo of potatoes with pesto on a crust was odd.. BUT I loved the antipasto platter.. a huge assortment of olives.. and the marinade was awesome.. Great wine.. great service! Ill go back for sure... and just order something without potatoes and pesto!! :-)"
1,"No room, don't buy passes on street. They are fake. The club was very small. But it was cool. You had people bumping into you constantly but what do you expect it's Vegas. I was a little upset the security guy didn't let me keep the picture I took of the model. But other than that it was ok."
1,"I keep hearing about Ambiente Golf Club, so I decided to book a tee time. They have 18 holes at Camelback Golf Club, and Ambiente is brand new and opened in November of 2013. The course has an incredible layout, and while hard, was a really good challenge. The bunkers are well placed, there is plenty of water, and once this course has time to mature, it will be one of the best in the Valley. The staff was really, great too. I got to meet with Filippa McDougall and we talked about her history with the golf course. From the time I pulled in until I finished 18 holes, it was a great experience all the way around. I can't wait to get back and play the other golf course."
1,"This is great food... Not sure how it's not rated 5!!! I have a very ethnic pallet, and for a random walk in... I wasn't expecting much! \nI will now be a regular!!! Someone mentioned not spicy enough... Tell them u want the level 10!! And it's a guaranteed ear popping, sinus opening, mouth burner!!! These people have serious service, and authenticity!"
1,"Just found this gorgeous salon yesterday! Tiffany did my nails, and she did a wonderful job. The owner is super sweet also. I got there at almost 6pm yesterday & they still took me even though they were supposed to close at 5pm. I loved conversating with Tiffany, she is definitely my new nail tech!! I love the comfortable atmosphere and the decos are super cute. The owner is so friendly and takes so much pride in her shop & what she does. They are wonderful people, I will definitely be back!!"
0,We ordered chicken  Parmesan for wife and daughter our first night in Phoenix.  The chicken was raw.   Seriously???  Due to poor lighting they ate some of it before realizing the chicken was raw.  I am not taking slightly undercooked I'm saying RAW!  We notified the manager and she was apologetic and gave us comp cards for next time .  Are u kidding?  No way at w going back there.  Wife and daughter got sick the next day.   Stay away!!!
1,Great service all around. The hair stylist really helped me pick out a haircut that fits my head and makes me feel good about it. The hand wax was weird at first but the after effect made them disturbingly soft. I actually enjoy it haha. Would recommend it to my friends.

1,"This restaurant is owned by Carla Pellegrino of Rao and Bacio fame, but run by her sister and brother-in-law.  The restaurant, formerly Chef's Palate, is small, but very busy on this Monday evening.  Fortunately we decided to only order entrees because the portion size is generous with most people departing with doggy bags in hand. \n\nMy wife's entr\u00e9e was salmon in salsa al limone - a very large portion of moist salmon sitting on a humungous amount of saut\u00e9ed spinach.  I ordered pollo scarpariello - oven roasted half chicken, topped with saut\u00e9ed red, yellow bell peppers, hot & sweet Italian sausage and hot cherry peppers.  Both dishes emphasized high quality, fresh ingredients.  Neither of us came close to finishing our meals so on our next visit, there will be one, we will likely share an appetizer and a single entr\u00e9e."
0,"My mother in law INSISTED on this place for dinner this weekend saying they had the best Mexican food she ever had. :/\n\nWe roll up and the hostesses didn't even greet us (there were 3 of them at the podium). They were rude and were too busy talking amongst themselves to even notice we were standing there. I finally had to say hello to get noticed, I wasn't happy about this. They gave us a pager saying it would be around a 30 minute wait. There were TONS of people sitting around waiting for seats. We were called for our table about 30 minutes later. By this time, the front was getting crazy busy with people waiting for tables. \n\nAs we were seated, we noticed of course all the people at the front waiting for a table-then we noticed all the empty tables.....a serious WTF moment. :/ There were at least FIVE empty tables just in our section alone. So they were either purposely creating a wait OR were seriously understaffed.\n\nOur waiter was nice but he seemed to be in a constant rush. We ordered guacamole which is made at the table, we received a bowl with large chunks of avocado which is NOT guacamole. He just sliced it into a bowl and stirred it a minute with a seasoning packet and served it. Again, I was NOT a happy camper. \n\nAll four of our dishes came with \""spanish rice\"". This \""rice\"" was obviously a boxed mix with frozen peas. The rice was hard to bite into and seemed out of place as it looked like a fried rice mix, it was bizarre.\n\nI ordered the chili rellano and the chilies seemed fresh and had good flavor but the rest of the meal was very bland. My husband had the shrimp fajitas and he took two bites and REFUSED to eat anything else on his plate.\n\nThis place makes cheap horrible food and charges $15/plate for boxed crap. It's only attraction is that it's in a nice location and charges a fortune for everything which attracts people who don't know any better (like my mother in law). \n\nIf you're one of those folks who thinks that just cause it's expensive that means it must be good, then come running to this place-I'm sure they would be happy to take advantage of you. \n\nIf you actually have taste (and taste buds), go to Valle Luna or Los Olivos or for God's sake even Filiberto's would be better than this place. \n\nDon't say you haven't been warned :/\n\nToo Long-Didn't Read version: bad overpriced food and service suck mmkay?"
1,"STRIPsteak is the best steakhouse I've been to in a long time and a complete opposite to the Morton's type steakhouses. We had various lobster, king crab and other seafood apps (all good) and I had the American Kobe cooked rare. A great \""value\"" given that it's only $18 over the $54 regular filet. My only regret is not getting the Japanese Kobe! One thing that I didn't think was so special (but not enough to take away a star) was when we were served duck fries \""compliments of the chef\"". Listen, they're just fucking fries, ok?"
1,"I had a great experience here!  My friends and I ate here after waking up in the afternoon and were able to order both breakfast and lunch.  One friend had waffles and a side of sausage, and the other had bacon, eggs, and a side of toast.  They had no complaints and said it was rather good.  I had the club sandwich and fries, which were also great (especially the fries which were battered and fried).\n\nWe were there on a Thursday afternoon when it wasn't so busy, about 1:30.  The service was great, friendly and prompt and the prices were reasonable...it is Vegas after all."
0,"This gym is the filthiest, smelliest gym I  have ever been in, the staff never cleans ANYTHING!   We joined as a couple the price was right but we found out the hard way why!  The Owner is extremely rude and seems to have a Napoleon complex or was having a roid rage moment!  We were over charged on our credit card by only 7.00 but the amount wasn't the issue it was never corrected..  When we brought this to his attention he freaked out and cancelled our memberships!  This blew our minds. His mistake, his gym who else do you go to? Well, not this guy, he seems really bothered by dealing with customer service a word he apparently never learned, his people aren't trained either which isn't any surprise!  Don't waste your money you might end up sick, if  this place doesn't clean up it's act they will most definitely be shut down! The health dept is on there way hopefully, I know several unhappy members who have reported these pigs!!"
1,"Biaggio's is amazing!  The pizza, bread, and desserts are incredible.  It is really the only authentic NY Italian food in town."
1,"I dined again at Buon Gusto, and the experience was a very good one.  But for this dinner with friends I have to drop my evaluation half a star.  \n\nWarm homemade Italian bread was excellent as before.  And, Fried Ravioli on the verge of being over fried was good with mild Marinara Sauce.  But homemade Cream of Mushroom Soup was too peppery for my taste.  \n\nA basic Romaine Lettuce Caesar Salad was very good, and a large portion of tender Veal Parmigiana was excellent accompanied by cheesy Fettuccini Alfredo.  An order of gelato produced two chosen scoops: Lemoncello and Chocolate.  Both were very good.\n\nThis time 4-1/2 stars overall!"
1,"Goodwiches and Good-location!\n\nThe wifie and I decided to check out the Goodwich after hearing so many good things about this place. We ordered the Foie and the Le Pig. Both were excellent sandwiches and were well thought out. \n\nLet's start with the Le Pig. This had a great balance of both flavor and texture. The lime ginger radish\\slaw went well with the rich pork and the crunchy texture of the chicharones made it all come together. It somewhat reminded me of a torta (Mexican sandwich) without the beans. \n\nThe Foie was a little bit more interesting. The Foie pate was paired with somewhat of a cabbage jam which made it a little sweet and chicken skin which again added the crispy texture. In my opinion I would have added a few more extra pieces of chicken skin as it got masked by the strong flavor of the foie. I would recommend getting either their house pickles or their pickled beets along with this sandwich to cut through the richness of the sandwich.\n \nI want to come back and try a few of their other sandwiches, maybe even create my own (fried egg with lots of chicken skin and bacon) mmmm I can feel my heart slowing down.\n \nIf you're looking for a late night spot to go after a few drinks downtown this would be the perfect place to satisfy your cravings."
0,Overall the service was spectacular! Alyssa was prompt and kept the meal moving without it feeling rushed! You could tell she loved her job and was informed about the menu!\nThe food on the other hand was nothing to write home about. I one word greasy. The oil on the gnocchi and spare ribs could be soaked up with a towel-gross. The cheese tortellini was overly oily as well. The only good dish was the bolognase which had a great flavor! Dessert was good but agin nothing great - we had the tiramisu. This is a neighborhood joint that I will not frequent again.

I weigh less than 200 pounds. I told him that if all it took to loose weight was for a man to tell me I needed to, I would have been thin a decade ago. He glared at me and said I needed therapy. He belittled me throughout that appointment. When I got home I filled out a form that his office sends to all patients and I noted that I was not motivated by derogatory remarks and a negative attitude. So today he erupted at me and blamed me for his inability to function as a doctor. \n\nIf you are a compliant little old man who looks to your doctor as God, believes it's OK to be belittled and never expresses personal feelings or opinions then perhaps Dr. Mason could successfully push you into your grave. \n\nThe crazy thing is, he thinks he is a great doctor - only if you have no health problems and don't require anything from him. He is completely intolerant of people with disabilities, women with opinions, and anyone who doesn't idolize him."
1,Great Chinese restaurant. Best in Las Vegas!!!!!!!!!! Also have cheap lunch special and dinner special after 9pm 7 days a week.
1,"The only reason why I'm writing a review on this is because I love the drinks here. It's weird because you would go to a bar instead of a club and rave about their drinks but XS just hits the spot. \n\nI had my first White Russian here and the one back home in Cali did not taste the same at all. My girlfriends and I would have to agree on this. \nMy friend had someone buying her a drink so she got the Tokyo Tea because she wanted to get hammered fast. We all hate that drink because it's pretty strong. But dude, XS did it right once again. They make THE best Toyko Tea ever. It really is one of most dreadful drink but here, they make me crave it!\n\nIt's a great club to go to, a lot of GQ guys for us girls, good music and perfect for summer. XS hosts 'Night swim' every Sundays too as well, so make sure you come here in your swim gear!  I come here every single time I visit Vegas which is very often. See you during EDC weekend! ;D"
1,"This pizza joint is a people pleaser, and they've definitely pleased me.\n\nMy party settled on the Algo Malo pizza, and it was very rich and delicious. A little heavy on the arugula, but that's an easy fix. Split between three people, we were still able to take a piece of the large pizza home. The prices are a little high, but manageable compared to their competition.\n\nThe service while dining in is very, very friendly so that is a huge plus. Even despite being busy with a near full house, the phone ringing off the hook inquiring orders, and only one oven working, nothing felt rushed or lackluster. I really appreciated that.\n\nAnother positive is that their menu is very flexible to their patrons wants and needs, be it substituting a certain kind of sauce (they have like 4?) or customizing your own pizza."
0,"Terrible. Scratched my car. Did not refund my money or offer to fix my car. Look at the pictures. I had my car three months. I checked my car for scratches religiously especially because I received a small ding at another establishment. \n\nWhen it happened I knew something was wrong because the guy drying my car was acting suspicious. \n\nThe manager said that it was not from their machines and they are not responsible. All I can say is be careful. If not, you might have to pay $450 like I just had to. \n\nUse this place at your own risk but know that if they do scratch your car, they will never own up to it or offer to fix it."
1,"Good range. On the small side, but clean and new. The staff is all pretty nice, although 1 or 2 of them will have their super cool utility belt with extra mags and handcuffs and whatnot while working. I mean, I'm all for guns and self defense and all that, but really? lol. They provide discounts for police/fire/ems/military."
0,"I had a chance to check this place out before going out and about on First Friday in February and I was quite disappointed. The concept of the bar is awesome and the drinks sounded great, but the overall execution was terrible. Really, this rating is completely based on service and maybe I should give it 2 stars as their drinks are very good, but that's about it.\n\nUpon arriving at Breadfruit/Rum Bar, we were told to sit anywhere in the bar area and someone would be around to serve us. There were about 20 or so people in the whole place (restaurant and bar), so it didn't seem that busy. However, it took about 10 minutes before someone came over to take our drink order or even acknowledge our group. Not a good sign. \n\nAfter we made our order or Estate Mai Tai, Dark and Stormy, Mojito Ponganot and French Caribbean Breeze, two of which were the server/bar keepers suggestions, we waited and checked out the decor. The ambiance inside is dark and relaxed, but made reading the menu almost impossible. Others around us and our group were using cell phones to try and read the menu, it was so dark. I get trying to give a place a vibe, but can we get a little bit of light to read? \n\nDrinks Arrive! These were amazing. I had very high expectations given the selection of rum and narrative behind everything we ordered, but was still impressed. Drinks were well blended and decently strong. The Mai Tai was off the charts and might have kicked my ass had I gotten another.\n\nWhich brings us to the next drink, that never happened. Our server/bar keep came by mid way through our cocktails and asked if we wanted a second order, but given the time it was taking us to get through the first one, three of us waited and one ordered a Red Stripe.\n\n15 minutes pass and most of us are either done or close enough to order another, but no server. Drinks done and our group is waiting for another 10 minutes. No Red Stripe and no second order. What the hell. Now we are sitting around waiting just to see how long it takes, but after 10 more minutes, we give up and go to the bar to get our tab. 10 more minutes go by and we finally have our bill, but there is no breakdown of what we ordered. It's just part of good service to always bring a breakdown of the bill and we were curious to see if the Red Stripe we ordered and never got was on there.  Sure enough, after 10 more minutes of waiting to get a breakdown of the bill, there was the unicorn Red Stripe. Getting that off the bill was another 10 minutes and finally, we were allowed to leave.\n\nI'm not sure what happened that evening, but there is no reason for poor service. The place was not that busy and they were clearly not understaffed  based on the amount of staff roaming around. The staff seemed preoccupied with assisting those sitting directly at the bar instead of the lounge seating behind the bar stools and the bar appeared to be getting great service. I'll give it another try for the drinks and sit at the bar, but it's with hesitation and low expectations of service."
1,"Very Busy, must have patients, thats the result of excellent food, service is a hit and a miss..."
0,you suck. i've waited for hours in the west end for a cab. you're more like an airport car service than citywide cab service.
1,"Sew Now is tucked behind Rosati's and Jack in the Box in the little strip mall - and it's a gem!\n\nMy better half has discovered the joys of custom clothing - which means buying stuff that fits right in all the right places, and then having Sew Now take care of the rest!  (I end up happy since she'll spend only $75 on jeans instead of $150+, and then get them altered to feel/look like she spent the larger amount.  Yay!)\n\nSuri (sp?) is the wonderfully nice woman who takes care of us every time we're in, and does such great work for absolutely reasonable prices!  They work quickly, and the workmanship has been superb.  We've had everything from jeans (did I say how much we're saving with a $10 alteration? Yes - yes, I did.), shirts, slacks to jackets all saved or improved by Sew Now.  For example, they hem the jeans so that the original hem still shows - how do they do that???\n\nCheck 'em out - you may find that your wardrobe has new life!"
1,"The place looks and smells exactly how you would imagine a rare books store would.  Every one of my interests has been satisfied by the bounteous selection and the owner is very adept at finding the rare book that you are searching for.  Screw the Kindle, I'm old school like that."
1,"So disappointed to see such poor reviews of Otto.  We loved it here.  It was by far the best meal I had in Vegas on this trip.  From the service, to the food, to the ambiance (minus the tables with kids), it was all perfection.  \n\nFirstly, we loved our server.  He was so patient and offered us a reasonably priced wine after we described they type of wine we like.  He offered wonderful suggestions and didn't push us to order too much, or too little.  \n\nWe stared with several appetizers:  ricotta fritters, which were incredible, lentils, way better than I expected them to be...(I wish they sold those at Trader Joe's), and two cheeses which were accompanied by jam and honey to compliment them.  We had a goat cheese and a cow's milk cheese.  \n\nBy the time we had gotten through the appetizers we were too full to each get a main course.  We were in the mood for pizza and split the eggplant pizza.  The eggplant was shaved thin.  The pizza had red sauce, which I love and the crust was perfectly thin but not so thin that the slice drooped onto your hand.  It was a fantastic pizza.  Finally, for dessert, we had the Otto Sundae.  Real good and made with gelato."
0,"Chicken kabobs were tasty, however the spinach wraps clearly tasted of freezer funk, so I ordered the orzo soup and hummus instead. The hummus was great but my soup had about three grains of orzo in it!! Won't be coming back."
1,"If you need a place to get the freshest and most authentic Chinese food in town, Hong Kong Garden Seafood & BBQ Cafe is the place to go. Whether you are craving peking duck, lobster, or even freshwater eel, this restaurant will definitely fulfill your cravings. Whenever I go here, I get THE freshest seafood and I am never disappointed with their dishes. There was this AMAZING waitress here that was able to provide me with extraordinary service and a welcoming atmosphere. I've been to a lot of Chinese restaurants here in Vegas and nothing compares to Hong Kong Garden. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a place with fresh and authentic Chinese food!"
1,"Decided to go this place because it's very close to my house and I was in the mood for Indian food and didn't want to make the trek to Saffron.  OMG!  Most menus at Indian restaurants are the same--you won't find too many varying entrees to choose from, but still, the Paneer Tikka Masala (I think that's the name) was out of this world.  I've gone back a few times since and have nothing but positive things to say about the staff and the restaurant overall.\n\nThis is a great place to get some solid Indian food at a pretty decent price."
0,"i've worked in a medical office, and i'm currently in PA school, so i have a good idea how the front desk should treat all patients. this place is horrible at it! \n\ni confirmed with my insurance that this office can offer me services, and right when i handed my insurance card to the receptionist, she declines me. i kindly explained to her my situation and that it would be best to call my insurance for verification. and of course she was too lazy to do it. how can you deny people services by assumption? just because an insurance card looks unfamiliar to you, doesn't mean you immediately reject them!\n\nafter a few exchanges, she finally offers an alternative - cash payment. i ask how long is the wait, she didn't even have an estimate! it was quite ridiculous how unhelpful she was. and on top of that, there were lots of patients waiting in an unkempt room.\n\ni recommend 1 World Medicine in Las Vegas for urgent care. they were very accommodating with my insurance and my late arrival. the staff is efficient and welcoming and their services are on the cheaper end."
1,"this place is great!! \nvisited Hawaiian Style Poke while on a short trip to LV with the wife\n\nwe arrived shortly after they opened, 10:15-ish, one customer ahead of us, and they had somewhat of a bigger order, but there was nothing in the cooler.. so I'm thinking, maybe made-to-order? or on that HI time! hahaha :)\n\nwe ordered 4 1/4 pound portions so we can try the different flavors\nhawaiian style poke, limu ahi poke, furukake ahi poke, and tako poke\nsooo good\n\nthe staff there were friendly and the store was very clean and organized\n\nthey also have a small gift shop with t-shirts, stickers, souvenirs, and also candies (Li-Hing) from HI\n\nmissing a star due to lack of parking and not being ready by store opening\n\nenjoy!!!"
0,"i've ordered from this place twice seeing how it got decent reviews and i wanted to give it a second shot before i passed judgement. sadly for me it was way below par. first time around i ordered my favorite kind of pizza with pepperoni, extra sauce and extra cheese; sadly it was overpriced and bland, all i tasted was cheese and grease. the next time i skipped the pizza and ordered their napoli pastrami sandwich which comes with a side salad, slaw or fries. i saw on their website they offered chili cheese fries which gave me an instant craving for some, but the lady on the phone would not sub them. i then asked if i could sub some spaghetti or something, she again refused. so i had to order my sandwich with a side of fries with an extra side of chili cheese fries. i figured if the fries were good they might be worth it but they weren't,  bland and barley warm. i literally live 2 blocks from the restaurant! and my food can't be delivered hot? that wasn't even the worst part, the sandwich was disgusting, the pastrami was so dry it was Inedible, to top it off it was just a rip off of Capriotti's Capastrami. btw chili cheese fries were also terrible, my dog literally would not eat them. he gave them a sniff and turned away. he did however eat some of the pastrami."
1,"Red or green?  Yes!\n\nI had no idea that I would like New Mexican food so much! Further, I had no idea that \""New Mexican\"" food was a thing.\n\nA friend of mine in Buffalo, NY recommended this place to me a few years ago & I've been carrying that around in my mind ever since.  This was my first trip to Phoenix since he told me about this.  I had just a little bit of hard time convincing my friends & family to try this place but none of us was disappointed!  \n\nThe food is delicious  :)  Try the salsas prior to ordering so that you'll know how you want your food prepared.\n\nThe service was great.  Our waiter took the time to explain everything to us & was very attentive to our requests (my wife orders food like Meg Ryan from \""When Harry Met Sally\"" - ugh).\n\nIf you don't like spicy food then you should just leave now, you'll be sorry if you don't.  I have a friend who can't eat too much black pepper - she would probably explode if she ate here."
1,I think I may have inhaled too many brownie bites from Yogurtland at the time of my first review. I don't know why I gave my favorite frozen yogurt place only 4 stars when it clearly deserves 5. I tried the Key Lime Tart flavor recently- it's really yummy. Try it. It's perfect for summer!
0,"Instructors that I have had previously (since I posted before) have now left. The only few instructors that I do like are Danielle, Lisa Virga and Diana. I feel as if the rest of the instructors have no idea what they are doing. I would be inclined to leave if I had not signed a two year contract for a price of $29.99 which you can't beat. The pricing is about the only good thing. The rooms are unclean, the toilets are always flooded, no hot water etc.\n\nThe one thing that bugs me the most is that they are soliciting $2-$4 for tips on their class cards on the doors etc. Also, most people do not follow the no bag or cell phone rule."
0,"One star for the food, a second for the people watching.   I'm being generous. \n\nFour of us walked in at 9 PM on a Thursday, all wearing suits and in good spirits. Sat at the bar, hoping to have a drink and ultimately something to eat because we just came from a conference and were starving. \n\nI live just north of Steak 44, in Paradise Valley and was really hoping to like the place so that it could become a regular go-to destination. \n\nI ended up in embarrassed to take my out-of-town colleagues there. It wasn't as if the bartenders were spending more time with other patrons among the light crowd, they weren't really paying attention to anyone. \n\nFinally, \""What would you like to drink\""? I've never been here before, so how about offering to help me out with the wine selection?\n\nI guess I'll hurry up and choose something since I seem to be imposing. \n\nLikewise, absolutely zero assistance, enthusiasm or even advice about the food menu. I ended up getting the meatloaf with b\u00e9arnaise on the side (my substitution), which was actually quite tasty. \n\nThere are too many other great restaurants in the area to put up with mediocre service. I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere."
1,"We came here for a \""snack\"", as my ever hungry friend called it, as we were here shopping.\nOur \""snack\"" consisted of a Spicy Chicken & 3 Cheese Pizza, Yummy Baja Style Fish Tacos, Black & Tan Beer Battered Onion Rings, shakes, a coffee, and an OMG Chocolate Chunk Cookie. I think we ordered more food but I was entering a food coma already so I sort of forgot, I just know the bill came out a little under $100.\nI'd compare the food here to a really good version of Friday's, good but nothing amazing.\nThe portions were pretty decent, big enough that most normal people would call it a meal."
0,"Well of course bad service often causes reviews such as this I feel it is warranted.\nI went in to the store to inquire about having my stainless steel rolex Daytona serviced.  I mention that I had seen a new one over seas for sale and the clasp was different than  my 10 year old Daytona.   The sales person showed me a new Daytona and indeed the clasp.is different.  She then called over another salesperson and to make a long story short they began to tell me that I had a fake rolex.  When you spend 10000 dollars on a watch you don't need to hear the dealer telling you its fake, and after running in back with my watch the first salesperson walked away and starting helping other customers.  I had to walk over and ask where they had taken my watch, without my permission.   In case you think I'm just some idiot with fake stuff,  I would like to mention that when my ROLEX DAYTONA was returned the 2nd sales associate said he just found out this was the correct clasp for a rolex Daytona of this vintage (1995, D serial).\nI for.one don't care for being treated poorly when asking about a $1000 dollar service on my watch.  TO THE MANAGER OF COFFIN AND TROUT, tell your people customers wearing jeans and a pizza restaurant t shirt may still have money, heck they might own a chain of pizza restaurants, and such people don't wear suits and ties, but deserve respect and competent service also.\nI recommend Jared ' s they have always been kind and respectful for my Rolex needs. \n\nIn response to Mr. Coffin,  your sales person DID NOT \""leave me in good\"", or any hands.  The woman went to another customer and I stood in your store sans Daytona or explanation. ......I might add your response In no way has attempted to resolve my complaint.  I am happy you responded and wonder what you feel a customer oriented resolution would be?\nSincerely,  marc\n\nMr Coffin responed to a message I sent and I believe he would bend over backwards to assist me if I ever return to his establishment.\n\nKudos Sir, and thank you for listening.\n\nGood luck, Marc"
0,"Wish I could have wrote a better review about this place. The mechanic i spoke with Was a nice guy an i felt confident the work would be quick and easy. I had some repairs on my truck. I was expecting it to take a couple of days and was expecting to spend up to a grand. The work was done and the vehicle passed emissions. BUT, within a day of getting the vehicle back the check engine light came on and now my a/c does not work. I popped the hood to see about the battery (as it was suppose to be replaced, it was) and under the hood there were bolts sitting on the side by the battery. I have no idea if they belong to my vehicle. There was also a rag tucked on the other side of the hood. The plastic cover on my neg. battery cable was sitting by the valve cover instead of being put back on or discarded. And the wiring harness which was accessed during the repair was not rewrapped and the wire that was worked on was completely exposed. I wanted to take the truck back but I was pretty soured on the lack of care for the work that was done. I will keep looking for a mechanic that gives me more bang for my buck."
1,"With all the media attention retail banks are getting for \""new fees\"" less customer service etc. I have actually noticed a marked improvement or have noticed employees of at least two Wells Fargo Bank locations in Henderson NV going the extra distance. \nLittle things, like smiling friendly service, recognizing you when you enter and leave the bank. Just the other day I was waiting in a line of about 8 people and all I had was a simple check deposit. Some employee, I dont know who or what their position was, came up to me and asked if that was all I had to do? Then she took the deposit behind the cage and brought me my receipt. With their awsome bill pay service online and widely accepted debit card, Im staying with Wells Fargo. Keep up the good job!"
1,"I have taken my clothes (both dry clean & wash-and-fold) here since 2008. Never an issue. Great quality and the absolute best customer service in town. They make you feel welcome and appreciated, which as we all know, is rare in Vegas.  Thanks a million Heather and James!"
1,"I really like this casino because of its features. For one, I really like the ambiance of Pure. I've always had a good experience every time I go to this club. I have yet to try Poetry, and this past Thursday I missed out on seeing that hottie Keri Hilson. The things I would do to that woman... you know like take her on a date and tell her how gorgeous she's looking and that I enjoy her company. Yeah thats the life.\n\nAnyway, another reason I like Caesar's is the Forum Shops. I'm not that big on gambling, but when you're bored waiting for others to meet up with you, the shops are a way to kill time. I know its mostly high end stuff, but its nice to see stores like Express, Gap, the Apple Store, and my personal favorite: Niketown. I can always count on Niketown to have something that catches my eye, yet I have to resist and save my money. \n\nReason #3: Fat Tuesday, which is next to Express and Niketown. Treat yourself to a Magnum 44 with a triple shot of Everclear and proceed. \n\nReason #4: the Forum shops have a Bank of America ATM located in one of the hallways. If you're a BofA customer and you're trying to avoid withdrawing from a 3rd-party ATM, this has to be great news to you. \n\nReason #5: Watching the Roman soldiers-in-costume chase people and eventually take pictures with them. Yessuh. \n\nReason #6: Cleopatra's Barge, the floating lounge with complimentary snacks and cougars galore. \n\nReason #7: The moving statues show. Way better than that living garden BS at the Palazzo. \n\nReason #8: F.A.O. Schwartz and the giant piano you step on to play it. It's even more fun when you're plastered. \n\nOK, I ran out of reasons. What I don't enjoy is how much of a pain it is to get to self parking. Trying to get here is one of the reasons I try to avoid driving along the Strip as much as possible. I also don't like that the tables usually have $10-$15 minimum bets. I know its Caesar's and all, but if you're a gambler on a budget, it would be nice to have. \n\nIf you like Elton John, Bette Midler, and Cher, you might like it here too. I'll update my review when I get around to staying here for a night or two, but for now, Caesar's is pretty solid."
0,"This place is a joke worst service 3 out 4 dinners sent back 2 dinners still wrong the second time, manager doesn't even come back to check ruined our evening and still paid 125 for garbage you want good food go to Parma, this place is over priced over rated and the service and manager dont even care!!!!!!!"
1,"I came to Casablanca for the first time yesterday and it was pretty good I must say! Having lived in the Middle East, this place was a pleasant surprise. I ordered the Casablanca Shrimp Wrap and boyyyy was it spicy! It was good but it opened up my sinuses LOL. I noticed that they offered hookah, but no one seemed to partake. I may come here and try it out sometime in the future. The space is not as big as I expected, but it is quite cozy. I did give a side eye when I asked for sprite and I was given a can and my fork was in a baggie..... o.O. yea lol The only other thing I can add is that the tv's that are on play Arabic music videos. Meh, I guess that adds to the atmosphere...But besides that, no complaints."
0,Blah! Blah! Blah!  My hubby and I came here with such high expectations after reading/ hearing all the reviews... and boy were we ever disappointed... infact my hubby got kind of quesy after eating here and we returned to our hotel to sleep it off...\nYet another buffet that I will not be coming to in Vegas
1,"Going to go ahead and give this place 5 stars, because the people are friendly and I have always found what I needed. Great snacks and drink variety. I understand that there are still many drinks they don't have, but they have the ones I want. Very convenient location for me. It is right across the street from my school so i can stop by there after my classes are done. Parking is convenient. Never had an issue finding a spot.\n\n I'm only 1/4 Asian and it's not Korean, but Korean products have grown on me. There's a beauty section that I have noted to go by next time I visit there. They also have some Japanese stuff. \n\n It can feel a bit awkward because most of the people who work there primarily speak Korean. I don't know Korean and I feel really bad making them have to speak English because of my lack of knowledge of their language, (this is why I have not gone over to the beauty counter!)."
1,We are in our late 30s. Thought i'd mention that because you don't have to be a senior citizen to love this show. The theater was great because it contributed to the authentic feel. The sound system was also top notch. But the show was fabulous. The singing was great and the comedy was in the spirit of the Rat Pack but it was updated to be relevant today. It was upbeat and made me want to jump out of my seat and dance. We sat in the back just in case it was corney or cheesy we could make our escape but we were so pleasantly surprised with the entire production.\nGood Job!
1,"First time coming here and we weren't disappointed. One of the best Rubens I've have in Arizona, everyone else in my party had burgers. The California, Bacon & cheese, and a cheese burger. Everyone was very happy with they're orders. Also tried the onion rings and cheese curds. Both were great. Great people behind the counter and very friendly. Can't wait to keep trying  more of the menu."
1,"Oh Le Reve, oh la la! \n\nLe Reve is the fabulous show at the Wynn Hotel and Casino.  It is a beautiful, breathtaking aquatic show.  The name Le Reve actually means The Dream in French, which plays nicely with its main theme and storyline.  The show is about you going into the the dreams of the main character and going on a fantastical adventure through the main character's subconscious mind.  And what an adventure it is!\n\nThis show was created by the mastermind Dragone.  He is the one that created O, Mystere, and Celine Dion's first Vegas show.  He used to be with Cirque but has since gone out on his own because the man is an artistic genius!  The man definitely knows what he is doing when it comes to dreaming up these amazing Vegas shows.  You ask how I know these things, well I used to be a concierge here in town and was lucky enough to attend several behind the scenes tours of this show, so I picked up some fun info right in the show itself.\n\nI really don't want to say too much about the show because I don't want to ruin it for you, but it is just a beautiful show.  It does have some Cirque-style acrobatics in it, as well as a lot of other fun imagery.  It is my favorite water show in town and I think it kicks the other water show to the curb!  \n\nThe theater is a huge circle, so no matter where you are sitting, you have the same view as the person directly across from you.  There are no bad seats but there are wet seats, but those are just more fun, in my opinion.  The action takes place in a 360 degree stage, as well as going from beneath the water to the top of the theater.  No matter which direction you are looking, you will be watching something amazing going on.  The show has so many different scenes that you are always on the edge of your seat wondering what they are going to do next.  \n\nLe Reve is simply beautiful, dark, mysterious, lovely, funny, and magnificent. all rolled up in one delightful package.  I think it is a must see show on the Vegas Strip for locals and visitors."
0,"I went in to set up a tire replacement for my tractor and Luis refused, flat refused, to provide an estimate or a copy of the work order he created. Has all the ear-marks of a bait and switch company, I will never do business with them! I will not take a chance on being ripped off!"
0,"We went to India oven after trying mint a couple of times, which by the way great restaurant with good food and decent price.\n\nThe ambience wasnt great, waiter seemed like traditional Indian gujju broken english. We ordered two vegeterian dishes dinner format that includes one naan and half rice ($18 each). Price was hefty but food was good. However the service was pathetic. There were couple of different people serving the table without proper communication withing themselves. We asked the first waiter for togo boxes for our left over food, however different waiter showed up and started to trash the food. We asked for an additional naan togo and that different waiter came back without naan even though they charged for it. When I asked about the naan he said he was not not told as if it was my duty to tell each time a different waiter shows up. All in all I wont recommend this place if you are looking at a good experience."
1,"Excellent local, family owned restaurant. The servers are polite, lovely decor and excellent Italian food. The recipes have been around for years and have been consistently delicious and authentic. Serving sizes are huge so go very hungry or be prepared to take home the extras. Warm, fresh bread with awesome herb butter. Good wine selection, nice happy hour and if you want to go in the late afternoon there's a half off early bird special. Don't let the strip mall location fool you, it's so worth going inside for a nice evening"
0,it was okay
1,Great place!  Check in online or on your phone for quicker service!  Wait times listed when u check in so you know before u go! Staff is friendly and nice.  Will definitely come back.
0,"A little pricey, and the quality and service was not there to match.\n\nHad the filet sandwich was very much overcooked (you could not request how you wanted it cooked), the beef was not at all tender, probably because it was over cooked.\n\nThe pizza was OK and the salad was great!\n\nThere wine bar looked interesting but I am not sure I will be back."
1,"For me, Grand Avenue is really where the action is on First Friday. I think the galleries there are more exciting and interesting. Case in point, Jordre Studio. Kyle is the kind of person I like. He lives by my same motto: don't dream it, be it. He's the kind of artist I like as well: he's not formally trained, he's self taught and self made and creates art that is entirely his own. You (meaning me) can feel a sense of freedom and joy and fun in his work. The paint is so thick that you just want to touch it. I understand all art is subjective, some people may not like it and that's fine. But his studio and his work are worth checking out nonetheless."
0,"In Vegas for a Girls' weekend and was super excited we had reservations for a Rick Bayless place.\n\nMundo is in a design center...somewhat strange locale but the restaurant is 'Latin Chic,\"" we went with it.   We all got super excited when we saw \""Mexican Corn\"" on the menu.  To be fair, this is out great expectation to another experience we had in NYC with mexican corn at a little hole in the wall place...AND this is Rick Bayless IT MUST BE EVEN BETTER! (wait for it....)\n\nThe \""MEH.\""  (Would have been aokay at 3 stars)\n1.  The sangria was tasty, none of us could get a buzz off of it.\n2.  The Mexican corn came out...and it was waaaay too rich.  There was waayyy too much cream/cheese in it to really enjoy it.  Had it been a bit lighter, we would have inhaled it.\n3.  Carnitas...had better.  RB didn't revolutionalize or improve upon it. Sadly...meh.\n\nThe Grr.... (minus the 1 star)\nService:  overall all the servers were friendly.  However dropped a few balls which wasn't such a huge deal...but don't lie to me about a $2 cup of coffee.\n\n- Initially Jose, our server was friendly, jabs here and there (perfect in sparring with these group of girls).  However as the night wore on...the attentiveness wore off.\nHe forgot my corn.  Come to find out, he served it to another friend at the other side of the table.  Not such a big deal.\n- Then came dessert.  I asked for a cup of coffee with a plate of Churros for the table.  The churros came, we ate it, it was okay, we sat there -- no coffee.\n- Meanwhile, a table he was familiar with sat down next to us and he proceeds to yak them up, even pulling out his phone for a slide show and having a complate conversation with the table.\n- When he finally got back to our table 20 minutes later, I looked at him and he realized he never brought my coffee and proceeded with the following:\n --   JOSE:   Oh! I am so sorry!  I won't charge you for it, it is removed it but let me give you a cup to go.\n --   ME:  Forget it..  Just take it off the bill\n --   JOSE:  Please. Let me buy you a cup of coffee.\n --   ME:  No, forget it.\n --   JOSE:  You sure?  Okay...well here's the bill, no rush\nMy friend took the bill and muttered to another friend \""ooh...the coffee is still on here\""\n\nNow.  Let me set something straight.  It isn't the $2 he charged for my coffee.  Rather , why make the big gesture of falling on the sword with \""I am SO SORRY! I TOOK IT OFF! LET ME BRING YOU A CUP TO GO!\""   Had that been it, I would have been fine, but no....he lies about a $2 cup of coffee..."
1,"If your looking for a low-key place to have a couple drinks, this is the place. The balcony has awesome views and its in the heart of old town. Its a must try at least once or twice. The menus are electronic! Innovative, I must say :)"
0,"Sweet Venezia is brand spanking new. I want a new Gelato shop to do well that is this close to home. Sweet Venezia isn't ready for prime time yet. They have a nice space, they have parking, the place is clean. \n\nHowever, they need to make their refrigeration colder, the gelatos were all soupy and melty. My fudge gelato was grainy as if there was a powder base and frankly... I drank it. Now we did stop in for drinks as well, but that wasn't what I had in mind. My partner ordered the Jungle Jolt and the person there wasn't sure how to make it. The other person cleaning wasn't sure either. They made a float, it worked and my partner liked it well enough.\n\nI wasn't happy with the consistency or overall quality of the gelato, but they are brand new and it might take them a bit to get their chill on properly. Maybe I'll check them out in a month or two and see if things are better, but I'm still in love with Arlecchino's and they aren't much farther away."
0,"I found the food to be EXTREMELY crunchy but tasteful. I ordered a fish. An orange one. Also, there were a lot of ingredients, just too many. I did have a wonderful beverage though."
0,"Placed an order to-go. Ordered appetizer sampler which weren't bad except for the cook missed two items and put something else other than what's described on the menu. Pad Thai was horrible.. It's really hard to find bad Pad Thai since it is such simple dish! This place had that noodle so dried and it did not have no taste! I mean.. no taste! :/ Last, I ordered papaya salad with salted crab and that was horrible! It tasted so fishy which made me think the crab might have gone bad! It instantly gave me stomach ache... Pad Thai and papaya salad are my favorite Thai foods and never fail when I order them from anywhere.... I felt like I just threw my $27 in the trash. My boyfriend had to open canned chili after a couple of bites because of how bad it was...\nStrongly suggest not to spend money on this place"
0,"Service is usually very sloppy in this location and they often mess up orders.\n\nFigured I could be more descriptive.. My family loveees tacos. With a passion. But every time we seem to visit this location we're lucky to get our orders correct. Plain is plain! -_- it's cool to stop by when the Diamondbacks win, but eh, we've moved on :("
0,"Great drinks, no problem there. But forget about getting food. 90 % of the time I try to get any type of snack here, especially bagels, they are \""out\"". Last Sunday my boyfriend got our drinks and tried to pick us up a quick bite with our beverages. The only food they had left was some kind of nasty muffins. He ended up just getting them and they were gross and ended up in the trash. I think coffee bean should just stick to drinks since they can't seem to keep their food stocked."
0,"I know this is a violation of Yelp Law, but my visit to Monta was only the second time in my life that I've had ramen (Cup O'Noodles doesn't count, not that I eat it).  \n\nI may have been spoiled by the first time, which was in New Jersey.  At that place I was able to customize it to the skies: choice of the regular pork broth, or chicken, or even vegetable.  Too salty?  \""No prob, we can do low sodium.\"" And I was able to have chicken or shrimp (can't remember which) instead of some fatty pork.\n\nIt wasn't that way at Monta.  What you see is what you get, complete with photos.  And since even as a kid I was nauseated by even the tiniest bit of fat on any meat or poultry, I couldn't stand the pork that was in the bowl and had to remove it.  I'll take a nice, lean piece of pork loin any time, but not the stuff that makes up the choices at Monta.  The broth was pretty decent, and I'm a sucker for noodles of any kind, but the ramen here will never be my comfort food.\n\nWhile service was quick, the tiny and cramped space does not lend itself to comfort or relaxation, so fast service was definitely welcome.  \n\nI don't disagree with all of those who love this place.  Different strokes for different folks, I guess."
0,I really wanted to check this place out. Excited to look around and sign up. The guy in the reception area couldn't be less interested. Since I wasn't feeling like he was going to help me I asked for a brochure. He looked for about 5 seconds and said they were all out. He said I could look online. Bad customer service. Where is the tour they advertise?  Very disappointed
0,Went here for appetizers with my family before a get together. The food we had was VERY tasty and I would love to eat there again whenever I come to the strip. I only give it two stars is because we had a waiter who took our order and was VERY neglectful and very very rude to our entire table. It really soured our dining experience. If we do go again I hope we get a different waiter or I would walk right on out again. No matter how good the food is bad service will completely ruin everything.
0,"I was a tenant for little more than a year as I house shopped.\nI loved the house, but hate the spectrum group. \nFrom day one they were hard to deal with and just fed us corporate lines. I was lucky to have my own (and very good) realtor deal with them. \nIn the end they basically took my security deposit.   What did I do?   Spent $2000 on landscaping(with permission), installed bathroom fixtures(there were none), etc. and generally improved the house.   I never asked for payment for these things but just made it nicer for the next person.  \nYet I lost my security deposit due to pre-existing(and provable) things or just made up BS.      I'm wondering if it's worth a lawsuit.   Do not rent or use in any way. Really."
1,"We had a lot of fun with Tracy. We were four girls celebrating a bachelorette party and  wanted to do something fun and memorable for the bride on this special day. The class was in a private room and was a combination of strip tease, lap dance and pole dancing. Tracy put us immediately at ease and the class was hilarious and we learned some quick easy tricks! The free spa facilities was spacious and clean with with a jacuzzi, steam room, sauna and refreshments. What a great way to relax before enjoying the three free VIP club passes that is complimentary with the class! I definitely recommend this experience for some great female bonding :)."
0,"This is a very small store, with a very limited selection of products. We always hit up this store and make do with the limited selection, but it's hard since both Lowes and home depot are just a mile away and you know you'll get exactly what you need at lower prices. \n\nMost of the staff are very friendly, but this past week we rushed in about five minutes before closing for something small. At exactly one minute to closing, an assistant asked if we were done. When we said we'd be just a minute, he rolled his eyes and said he had a family that he'd like to see. We dropped what we were looking at and walked out. It was not like we were there looking at and deciding on tiles or fittings options for 30 min after closing - just some yard gloves that we wanted to make sure was not made of latex. It doesn't matter if you are a chain or a mom and pop store - make the customer feel like an idiot (especially in a non-situation like this) and see your $$$ flow the other way. To be fair, we've had pleasant experiences with some other staff, but lately it seems that none of them are very knowledgeable about the products in the store at all (reading labels and repeating what it says does not count)."
0,"Wow.. The service here is deplorable, I don't know if I've ever been so disrespected  before at any bar. One of the bartenders spilled a bottle of j\u00e4ger and doused me with some booze without so much as an apology. Not to mention it took maybe 12-15 minutes just to get a beer after sitting down at the bar.. The only thing that brings me back here is that I have no choice with the lack of arcades for the kids.. Once again, poor service from a poor location."
1,"Alright so classy I know, but we had the corn dog puppies and lobster roll...\n\nBoth were really good. Drinks were good. Decent happy hour deals also\n\nThe bartenders were great. I really enjoyed the music though...I heard Korn, Alice in Chains, and Metallica while I say at the bar. There aren't many places that I've been to where I could say that. ...made me want to stay longer"
0,"Horrible bland food. Horrible service, but a sweet girl. TVs were waaaay too loud -only 30 people in the huge place, the loud volume was not necessary. Table was dirty. We'll never go back."
1,"Facilities were clean and spacious, but I should focus more on raving about the deep tissue massage I received!  \n\nI believe my therapist's name was Michael...not sure, but the BEST deep tissue/swedish combo I've ever had in Vegas.  Seriously."
1,"I'd been to the downstairs bar and back patio a few times for beers, which are both nice. As some other have mentioned, they have a great selection of beers. This spring, I discovered the upstairs. Really fun dance parties. Most of the crowd is comprised of just out of school hipsters (i.e., young), but people get along and there was very minimal attitude. The DJ's are a little lazy. They just plug in a macbook and ipod, and play whatever their whimsy dictates. It would be nicer if they thought out their sets more carefully, but everyone has a good time, so that's not such a big deal."
1,"I purchased a shirt here a couple of days ago when I was in Vegas. Love this store. So many nice things. One of the best shirts I've ever gotten. So comfortable and looks wonderful. I loved the service here, exceptional. Great selections of dresses and many other things. The sale rack was great, cause most of the other things I couldn't afford. Quite the high prices."
0,"Great costumer service, unfortunately the pizza was very plain, I will stick with CPK."
1,"The District is a beautiful place for shopping and dining!\n\nIt is a beautiful area to walk around.  There are plenty of great little shops and the normal chain stores. After a little bit of shopping cardio, there are plenty of options for dining.  Balboas, Elephant Bar and Settebello Pizza are just a few to enjoy.  The GVR casino and resort is also located next to the area.  \n\nThey have recently added the road going through the center of the shops with parking.  I did like it better when it was all blocked off for people to walk but it's still good.  \n\nIf you are in the Green Valley area, stop and shop!"
1,I had the Philly cheese steak with extra cheese. It was pretty good. I also like that they have seasoned fries. Solid place to eat.
1,"I enjoyed my trip to Sprouts. It's in the Trader Joe's / Whole Foods realm. In fact, it really made me think of a tiny Whole Foods. Lot of great fresh produce. If you're hunting for some produce that you haven't had luck funding elsewhere and/or didn't look so good elsewhere, Sprouts might just have it. They also had a good selection of high-quality spaghetti sauces, condiments, etc. It's definitely a grocery store that I will add to my list for finding more unique products. It's on the pricey-side, though, so I can't say I'd ever make it my go-to, single grocery store. If you haven't ever been to Sprouts, I recommend giving it a whirl."
1,"Wow, who knew? Great Mediterranean food on a hill in a trailer park overlooking the Beltline. Excellent service, great belly dancing, hookahs on almost every table. Highlights included chicken kabob with fresh grilled veggies and chicken on bed of incredible couscous, Mediterranean pasta and falafel. Only negative was they were sold out off eggplant parm from the night before!"
1,"I'm so happy I tried this place out!  I stumbled upon this place because my eye doctor is near here.  I was attracted to the green tea cake.  Had a feeling it was the same chef that was at Goyemon, and it was!  Yippie!! Tofu cheesecake back on my list and Green tea cake and I saw other things to try.  It was about an hour before closing so of course what I wanted to try was all gone.  However, more reason for me to return and drag my fianc\u00e9 along with me!  Yay I'm a fan!"
0,"This is just for the service department!!!\nI purchased a 2011 528i and the car is great but every time I bring it in for some service, I end up getting the worst service. They don't have loaner cars and when they do they say \""we can't loan you a car for just a oil change service\"". Due to the quality of the service department I am going to get rid of my car once I can break even on the sale of the car. I had a lexus gs450H before my BMW and I will have to say the service between the two are night and day. Yes, I can go to another BMW dealer for service but why should I when I live half a mile from this dealer. \n\nVery disappointed in the quality of service from a high end car dealer. This will be my last BMW I purchase."
1,"Wow, tapas in Vegas has not disappointed me!  Three words:  bacon wrapped dates - omfg, delicious.  I think I almost finished a plate on my own. The scallop were also very good as were the peppers (not that spicy!). We ordered quite a bit of food and two pitches of sangria AND a paella (which, warning, is HUGE...and delicious).  I think the total for our large group was $35 a person...extremely reasonable by Vegas standards.  The outdoor dining area is huge - great for people watching."
0,"This was a horrible experience in the drive thru. Cars parked in line with their engines off. 4 Staff members playing inside store. The only person that was actually working was the guy on skates. 30min stuck in line, burnt food, cold food & horrible service."
1,Food is amazing and the service is top notch! It nice to come to a restaurant were the people actually serve you with a smile!!
1,"I was passing by the place , and since I like Thai food I thought I will give it a try . and I do not regret it. One of the best , the food taste good and fresh , I had 4 different dishes to go, my wife and kids loved it too. It was  very good"
0,"Hooters is a crappy hotel! The wings aren't even that great! Try Terrible's wings (see my review) and you'll be glad you did. The hotel looks cheesy on the outside & is just as cheesy on the inside. They try to sucker people in with the Hooter girls as dealers & waitresses bending and giving everyone a peek at their business. Big deal! You can see that sh!t from thousands of chicks on the strip....not to stray but have you seen the way most chicks are dressing in Vegas these days! Yikes! It's gotten so that you can't tell which ones are the \""working girls\"" and which ones are the visitors. But anyway, back to hooters schemes to get'cha in to their casino. $100 free slot play! You see it all over Vegas..on cabs, billboards, etc. I guess it worked on us because we went here for that reason and that reason alone (probably not for the males in our party though who were finally more than willing to go!)! Do I smell something fishy, and I don't mean the females here, or what?! Waste of time? YES! You sign up for the players card and then you MUST play at the 12 designated machines they have for this \""$100 free play\"" promo. Then you play the hundred in $2 slots & if you win you can't keep the money! Only if the money reaches over 2400 (or something like that) in credits. Then you get an amazing $50! Don't waste your freaking time! That money flies in like 2 minutes. Spend your time and money going to a better casino!!! And fellas, if T & A is what you seek than tour the strip! Seriously."
1,I thought the pizza and salad were fantastic! Great flavors! And the atmosphere was fantastic!! Our waitress was spot on but it seemed like the rest of the staff were right out of the Robert Palmer video without a smile to be had... :|
1,Great tacos (I recommend the 'crunchy') very nice beer selection. I was surprised and pleased...from the plain jane name was expecting a dive bar.
1,Never a disappointment at PT's! Especially this one with the nice lounge area in the back and two pool tables. Food comes out fresh and tasty and their pizza's cannot be beat! Especially for $9 on Happy Hour. Definitely my bar of choice!
0,"I was here hosting an event for about 25 people. The rates were good but the hospitality, service and professionalism were not. The reservation desk employees were very nice, though. Dealing with the catering staff, everyone we talked to, including managers were downright rude. For as much money as we are spending here (20k), I expect stellar service. We were constantly told \""no\"" and never given reasons, could never get a hold of staff to help us w our requests. \""no.\"" ICE! We are an easy going crowd and didn't as for much but when you can't get a hold of a manger on duty, time after time, it gets old. I'd never host an event here again. The conference room we reserved was disgusting. The table cloths were full of food, dirt and hair. They over charged us for everything- as well as having crazy ridiculous prices to begin with. Its like they don't care about us and when we did finally find managers and did complain, they laughed at us. Not only is the hotel a smoke pit, the restaurants were not up to par and half are closed during the week. We won't be coming back."
1,"This is \""Chew with your Mouth closed\"" type food.\n\nThat means SAVOR this stuff people. The Beef Bourgignon might be the best \""melt in your mouth, yet hints of crispy-ness\"" meat I've had. \n\nGreat Somelier (wine expert) on hand to help you pick and choose the right bottle based on your meal. Really friendly staff. Great view, hanging over the strip.\n\nYou're in Vegas. Go out, and spend some cash. Make some memories. 3 of us had a bill of $260 before tip. But that included 2 amazing onion soups and a big league crabcake. And 2 great uniqe bottles of red wine.It originated in West Hollywood, I can't wait to go there next. Do it.... Vegas! Do it!"
0,"Been there three times hoping its going to get better.\n\nHere is the lowdown...\n1st time I went I was told they had a game that was my favorite, when I got there they didnt have it. Half of the games I wanted to play were out of service. Some of my friends had a booth and were playing playstation or some shit that we could all play at home and they were being charged per person at the booth. Since I had not came with them and I ordered al my drinks from the bar, and never even played the game...they still tried to charge my friend for an extra person because I was over there talking to them...\n\nThe concept is great, lacks management and seems like a free for all with the service and they way they treat people there.\n\nI will never step foot in there again. would rather go to pinball museum."

0,"The interior quality and the VIP seating with alcohol is a great addition to this theater but the crowds are terrible. For some reason every time I go here the people at this place are ultra loud, talking on their cell phones, yelling to each other, etc. It makes it nearly unbearable to watch a movie here. And it's not just me, it's most everyone I know that has had these same experiences. All of my friends avoid this place anymore.\n\nIt's definitely a trade-off. If you want booze and super comfy seats, and don't mind dealing with some noisy people, this is a good pick.\n\nIf you want quiet, head to the SouthSide Works theater."
1,"This place has great pizza! The atmosphere is nice, with a long bar and an open kitchen so you can watch them put the pizza's in the large brick oven. Try your pizza with sun dried tomatoes, meatballs and risotto-- so good on that delicious crust. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because I find it so damn irritating that they have the menu on the place mats, but when you sit down there is always a plate over it that you have to move to read the menu! It gets really awkward with a large group and everyone having to hold their plate while reading. Sounds picky, I know, but it's irritating."
1,"The tapas are delicious. We had a mishmash of sorts, the bacon-wrapped dates, the chorizo/chicken mushrooms, the tinga empanada, the mac and cheese. Everything was delicious!!!! Can't decide which is my favorite, but everything was great! The drinks were good, too!"
1,I would definitely recommend! I'm currently getting tattoo removal. Very kind staff and reasonably priced
1,"Stayed here for a long weekend with my boyfriend. We were pleased with the room (furniture, media, decoration etc.), the building amenities and overall offering. We spent most of our time in the hotel & the City Center \ncomplex and felt we could easily fill 2-3 days without getting bored there. Very happy they had free Wifi.\n\nThe casino is high quality without the overwhelming glitz some of the other higher end places thrust on you.  We had some excellent dealers who had great rapport. \n\nNegatives: The beverage service at the tables was colossally slow/spotty. There weren't enough regular restaurants & stores (deli, coffee shop, convenience store). Everything was quite expensive - not that that isn't the standard in vegas, but its still shocking and a negative."
0,"Plain and simple don't stay here... Spent one night and it was one night to many... Only stayed because of groupon and will never trust either again! Horrible rooms... Lots of broken parts(shower, lights, end table)... Even the sheets where dirty... Pay the money and stay any where but here!"
1,"This review isn't for Subway in general but this location specifically. I have closer Subways to me but this location surpasses them on service. They know me by name now, remember what sandwich I like, and that I am a student at UNLV. All meaningless things, sure, but the fact they took time to remember deserves my business. The employees are always in a good mood and the owner and her family, mainly her daughter, are so friendly. They truly make you feel like part of their extended family. \n\nAs for the food, its made neatly yet it tastes the same as the others. The presentation is definitely better and the restaurant is clean and organized."
1,"This was one of the coolest things I have ever done in Vegas. I have been going to Vegas at least once a year since I was about 7 years old. So I remember many of these signs. It was so neat to see them all in one place and that this exists. The tour guide was great. She really knew her stuff and gave you a lot of information on all the signs. The tour takes about 1 hour and was really fascinating. She had great stories about the people behind the signs and I learned a lot! When you get sick o the food and smoke and slots, head down to the museum and get a little history! \n\nThey are restoring smaller signs and putting them back in the community for everyone to enjoy. I thought this was great. There are day and night tours but it was way cooler at night! There are restrooms and a small gift shop with some great books on Vegas. They have really old signs and newer signs like Treasure Island's old pirate sign. So even if you haven't been going to Vegas as long as I have, you will see some signs you might recognize."
0,"This is my first yelp review, but I felt so passionately that this show is a waste of money that I felt the need to share my thoughts. I am not one of those people that are difficult to please, or a debbie downer all the time.\n\nI have seen almost every cirque show in Vegas. Zumanity (twice), La Reve (twice), Love, and now \""O.\"" I like Cirque shows. However, all the hype led to higher expectations than what you actually see in \""O.\"" I was very impressed with the guy on fire (he burns throughout an entire scene)--but other than that, La Reve was much more impressive. \n\nLa Reve has a much more intimate theater, no seat is poor. At O, the theater is jam packed and the seats uncomfortable. I was bored and very  uncomfortable the whole show!\n\nThe clowns weren't funny, and were on stage for way too long. I would have been happier if the clown scenes were shorter, making the entire show a bit shorter. \n\nOur tickets were 25% off, still 393 for three people (after taxes and fees), at some of the best seats in the house. Row K, seats in the center, right on the edge of the middle section. Not worth it at all. I would not pay twenty bucks to see this again.\n\nLike all cirque shows, there wasn't really a theme... which usually doesn't bother me, but this one flowed even more awkwardly than the rest.  I recommend La Reve. It is passionate, and remarkably entertaining, although no true theme, I was able to connect with it. I had no emotional connection with O... Kind of just made me feel like I was having a bad dream... or hallucinating? Not good. Definitely too scary for kids, don't bring em."
0,"The service was good...don't get me wrong.  Nothing but sunshine and smiles at this location.  The only thing that bothered me was they sold me on a crappy-tasting drink...\n\nI had asked the lady who rang me up which of the seasonal beverages she preferred (i think there was a peppermint mocha in there, an eggnog and a gingerbread) and she sold me on the gingerbread latte type thing.\n\nBLECH.\n\nThere was a fat layer of white sugar on the bottom and the Ginger flavor was overpowering... it was an iced beverage but it burned my throat.  And it tasted watered down. boo.\n\nGranted it was a free drink (sign up for their little email club and they'll send you a coupon for a free drink plus another one on your birthday)... but still.  Why sell me on something that tastes bad?"
0,"Ordered the juicy 8 ounce burger with folded in cheddar cheese on a wheat bun with happy hour chicken strips. The chicken strips were lightly breaded & slightly singed, but you could taste the char, kinda weird.\n\nThe burger arrived hot, along with the bun & a generous helping of toppings. I liked how juicy it was, but it didn't live up to expectations, when it came to taste. The burger was seemingly flavorless.\n\nThe person that came with me ordered the same burger and also said that it lacked enough flavor to justify it's cost. He even mentioned of visiting a fast food company afterwards.\n\nThe burgers were juicy, but when it comes to flavor and because of the higher cost, I would suggest finding another location to get one. Minus two stars for lack of flavor and one star off for the server not checking to see how my meal was going."
1,Love the johnny # 2 roll
1,One word: YUM.
1,Applebee's has revamped and come a long way. Food is better. Three cheese penne is to die for. Absolutely addictive. Had dinner there last night. Melissa was our waitress. She was quick and did an excellent job. Some of the best service we've had in a while. Food was cooked in a timely matter and arrived at the perfect temperature.
1,"This entire process was a breeze.  I was cited for an unsafe lane change and submitted my ticket.  Within a month, the citation was dismissed and I never had to leave the house.   I was able to submit all of my information online and the communication was phenomenal.  Even if I still had to pay a fine, the $50 I paid for legal fees was worth not having to take time off of work and appear in court.  I hope I never have to use this service again, but, if I do, I will be a repeat customer."
0,"Skimpy tacos and only OK salsa, combined with the fact that an employee used the bathroom and resumed behind the counter without a hand-washing, made this the worst America's experience I have ever had. The only redeeming quality were the chips, until we got to the bottom of the basket and found a hair!"
1,"Yay for Yelp - I never would have found this otherwise.  Wicked Spoon puts all the other budgets to shame. No, you can't do everything perfectly at a buffet that feeds thousands everyday, but almost everything was awesome.  Succulent lamb, amazing veggies and raviolis with goat cheeses were highlights. I went for brunch 2 days in a row w/bottomless  mimosas.  Service was great too. Highly recommended!"
1,"I started using Leo's service back in June of 2013.  He's assisted with personal and business trips and never fails to provide great service.   The #1 feature I look for is timeliness for travel and Leo's service is always spot-on.   The cars are clean, the driving safe and comfortable and the prices very reasonable.\n\nWould highly recommend these guys for any trips or transportation needs!"
0,"It must be a new management/owner because the plate of fried calamari is really very small compared to what it was even last year (and more expensive). Before, you could share a plate with your other half, but now you have to eat also the whole basket of bread to fill full. That's sad because Marven used to be a great place to eat calamari and drink ouzo."
1,"+ Awesome service\n+ delicious steak\n+ thin crispy shoe string fries\n+ super fluffy cinnamon sugar donuts\n+ heirloom tomato salad with basil - YUM\n+ border crosser (shot of tequila + beer)\n\nCame here with friends in hopes of delicious delicious meat. They change their menus so what we were hoping to get was no longer on the menu, sigh. However, the manager came buy and said if we ever call in a day before hand they'll be sure to make it for us - score.\n\nOur group ended up ordering various steaks topped with eggs and frites, and I ordered the lobster pasta. Everything was delicious and freshly made. But my favorite was the donuts, seriously something about that light and fluffy dough coated in cinnamon sugar. Plus it comes with 3 dipping sauces (chocolate, caramel, berry compote) OMG. If you go save room for dessert!"
0,"Perhaps the most overrated Thai restaurant in Vegas, Pin Kaow was a disappointment for me.  I ordered the Rad Na (Lad Na).  It was very bland, even with chili added to it.  I tasted my friend's yellow curry, and it was generic with sweetness and no real character or authentic flavor.  The crab rangoon was pretty good, very sweet and fried well.  However, I've had much better Thai food at numerous places in Las Vegas. Prommares kills this place, and even though Thai Grill isn't as good as it used to be, it is still better than Pin-Kaow and is just down the street on Lake Mead and Decatur.  \n\nWe had to wait 15 minutes outside before we were seated, and we were only seated after we went *back* into the establishment, asked for tables again, and split up our rather large party of 8 people.  The place was packed... with non-asians.  This doesn't always mean anything, but after tasting real authentic Thai food for years at Thai Grill when it was good, I can safely say that the food at Pin Koaw is geared towards Americans who probably don't know the difference."
0,"We went this morning and decided just to have the buffet since the waiter did not produce a menu and seemed to be pushing the buffet. It was fairly disappointing; the biscuit and gravy was by far the highlight,  in my opinion, but don't be too excited by my choice of words. In addition, it was a good 5 or 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were waiting to be seated. When we were finally seated, the table and my chair were both still dirty. I could add more, but the bottom line is that this was definitely not even close to my best restaurant experience."
1,"I like the look of the lounge. A lot of Room, Big screens around. Good spot to go for sports events. The staff is good the wings are pretty good the tacos not so much.. I love the drink specials and the deals they have here. Good spot !!!"
0,"Too bad it isn't possible to post zero stars!  Do not waste your time with this company.  If your insurance company tells you they are sending 777 Towing, tell them to send someone different.  If they tell you that 777 Towing can be there sooner than any other service, don't believe it.  After being told they would be there in 45 mins to 1 hour, the next message was that it would be 90 minutes.  When that time had passed, it would then be another 30-35 minutes.  When that time passed, it was then going to be another 30-35 minutes.  After a LIVID discussion with them, got a call from the insurance company that their truck had broken down and they couldn't make it at all.  That was never mentioned in any conversations directly with them.  Insurance company contacted another towing company, and they arrived exactly when they said.  BTW, this was all in the middle of the night with the car in a dangerous location on a freeway on ramp.  Stay away from 777 Towing."
0,"My problem with Coup Des Tartes really is that the food is horribly overpriced...not moderately overpriced makes you feel like you're eating at a fancy place, but outrageously overpriced for the quality of the food. For their price points, the food should be a lot better and the tables shouldn't be so close to each other. Their food reminded me of the kind of food I can get from the Whole Foods deli. After Valentine's Day here, I felt taken advantage of by the restaurant. $100 PER PERSON for a measly set of 4 courses with the awful offering of cliched mushroom risotto as the sole vegetarian option, with no choice of anything else. Had the menu been priced at around $40 a person, I still think this place would still only be a 3 star quality but at least reasonably priced. \n\n- Brie Brulee: A name far more interesting than the dish itself. It's a warm slice of brie served with stale/boring crusty bread and fruit. There was the tiniest bit of fruit compote served with it, so at least someone in the kitchen did something that required effort with this otherwise simple dish. \n- Onion Tarte: Probably the tastiest thing all night, but again, not worth the money. It has a very strong caramelized onion taste with a nice flaky crust.\n- Salad: Greens, fruit, nuts, and too much dressing. It was fine but not worth $25.\n- Chestnut Soup: Didn't taste a thing like chestnuts. The taste is actually like an Indian lentil soup called Sambar. \n- Filet Mignon: My boyfriend seemed to like it. The mashed potatoes it was served with were very good. The other accompaniment were sugar snap peas drowning in butter/oil.\n- Lamb Shank: The couscous & veggies served with the lamb were very boring tasting, like no one even took the time to season them.\n- Cherry Tart: This was yummy, and fortunately didn't taste much like cherry. The shortbread crust was good and the combination of warm pie with cold ice cream is classic.\n- Chocolate Ganache Tart: Pretty good. It, of course, tasted like chocolate. Nothing really remarkable.\n\nI'm confused why everyone calls this place charming. It is not charming to be a foot away from the tables next to you. It is not charming to hear their conversation like you're having it with them, struggle to push out your chair to get up because there is another chair right behind you, and struggle to squeeze yourself between tables to leave. I cannot recommend Coup Des Tartes to anyone. The restaurant left a very bad taste in my mouth, figuratively. With so many other nice, moderately overpriced restaurants with much better food, I don't know why anyone would come here."
1,"If a french fry and a potato chip had a baby, the frites at Mon Ami Gabi would be it! My steak came with a heaping mountain of them that took up half the plate. And it was a big plate. \n\n...and the steak. Ahh so delicious! Perfectly cooked, flavorful, medium-rare perfection. I opted for the peppercorn sauce, which had a slight kick and complemented (not overpowered) the meat. Pretty generous portions, but I still finished the whole thing!\n\nWe dined on the patio that sits right next to the Strip, overlooking the beautiful Bellagio waterfront. We basked in the warm glow of the heat lamps that still kept us comfortable in the 48 degree weather. \n\nMy friend subbed out her frites for a side of green beans and they forgot, but they let us keep the frites they brought out anyway, which was nice. Service started out strong and then tapered off to borderline neglect towards the end of the meal, but it was super busy so all is forgiven.  Loved my dining experience here and the prices are reasonable. I will definitely be back!"
1,"What a fantastic place to grab a bite to eat, a nice glass or two of wine and sit outside on the 2nd floor patio when you're in the 'burbs of Charlotte.\n\nA local friend and I comfortably relaxed on the outdoor couches on a pleasant Monday evening catching up on life, while enjoying a crisp pinot grigio. Hummus, scallops, and a delicious flatbread loaded with figs and goat cheese capped off the night.\n\nSounds like this place gets pretty busy at the end of the week, but I think I'd much prefer the laid back atmosphere we experienced mid week."
1,"I would suggest that anyone who lives here and has not been come, and if you're in town and looking for a great local non-chain restaurant that has quality food prepared the way it should, then try Cibo!  \n\nI took my man here for \""mystery date night\"" as a surprise since he had never been.  No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!  \n\nI have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.  You will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date - hell, maybe even a mystery one :)"
1,"The Fresh and Easy brand is good quality. I like all their pre-made entrees for when I don't feel like cooking. Try their chicken pot pie. Delish! \n\nThey also have a good selection of wine and beer. \n\nI am also a big fan of their new Wild Oats brand. The Wild Oats eggs were laid just three days before and you can tell the difference in quality. \n\nI am selective when I shop here because some items can be on the pricy side, but overall I am happy with this store. Check it out!"
0,Gross. Awful service. RUN AWAY!
0,"If I could give zero or even negative stars for Corinne at the Benefit Brow Bar, I would. I had been going to Valerie at the Silverado location, but today I went to Corinne here at North Rainbow. BIG MISTAKE! I went because I had a lunch break at work and my brows needed to be waxed. I didn't realize I already had an appointment with Valerie tomorrow. I thought it was next week - coincidentally she left a message while I was getting the worst wax of my life. I will never return to Corinne again.\n\nI got there a little after 12:00 PM, and I was told that the Benefit employee was supposed to be there already. I waited about 10 minutes, and Corinne finally arrived. She told me to wait in the chair because she had to finish her own makeup. She said she dropped her Gimme Brow in the car and couldn't find it. She seemed very upset by this, and she said it was her favorite product. She said one of her brows was unfinished. She looked fine to me. \n\nShe used the Gimme Brow sampler without using a new applicator (she used the one on the sampler). She told me she was late because she had to take her boyfriend to work as his own car was in the shop. Then she got the waxing stuff set up. She appeared to be moving in slow motion, slowly grabbing wooden sticks and cotton-tipped applicators from the storage container. It took her about three attempts to get the wooden sticks out of the container (they weren't packed tightly or anything). It seemed a little off, but I figured she was in no rush as she was apparently late for work. Hindsight is 20/20, and I am now actually worried she was under the influence while performing my service.\n\nI told Corinne that I had been growing my eyebrows for the past 4-5 months, and that Valerie said they had been growing in nicely. I complimented Corinne on her own eyebrows and thought I was in good hands (since I liked her own eyebrows a lot). She never asked me to sign a liability waver, which I recall signing with Valerie every time.\n\nAs she waxed my eyebrows, she kept saying that \""everything I do has a purpose\"" and \""don't touch your eyebrows between waxes.\"" She said she was \""starting from scratch,\"" which gave me pause because I have been going to Valerie for 4-5 months. If I have that much regrowth, why is Corinne making such a big deal out of it? I felt like she was lecturing me about how to maintain my eyebrows. I told her multiple times that I don't do any tweezing between visits, and that I have even bumped up my appointments in the past to accommodate fast growth.\n\nCorinne seemed inexperienced, as her motions were not very fluid. She was very rough with every touch, even when just simply cleaning. It hurt. However, if it looked good in the end, I was willing to deal with some roughness. After all, waxing isn't exactly a pleasurable thing. Unfortunately, my brows look terrible.\n\nTowards the end, I mentioned I had a scar on the right eyebrow. It has never affected the outcome, and I thought it was irrelevant since I was growing out my brows. The scar is only visible when my brows are thinner, and even then it doesn't look bad. Corinne then scolded me and said \""you really need to be telling people that because I could have really messed things up.\"" She then told be about a woman with bushy eyebrows and a big, noticeable scar. She lectured me for about 5 minutes. As a professional, she should ask that information if it is THAT important. Again, I didn't volunteer this information because the goal is to be GROWING my brows, not making them thinner. \n\nThis is when I really got the impression that she is young, immature, and inexperienced. Nevertheless, I know there are some high school students out there that tweeze their own eyebrows to perfection. All I cared about was the end result.\n\nShe did at least put on some eyebrow products to make them presentable, but that really would not have been necessary if she had done what I asked in the first place. She used the Gimme Brow sampler on me, which she had previously used on herself.\n\nI paid $20 for the service and left a $5 tip (even when I receive bad service, I have a hard time not leaving a tip), but I was not able to fully evaluate just how bad things were until I got home and removed all of the product she put on my skin and brows. I HAVE NEVER HAD BROWS THIS THIN. I have had some unsatisfactory wax jobs over the last decade, but this is by far the worse. My brows are also uneven. She took an unbelievable amount of hair, approximately 40%! I have pictures that I just took; it is just unbelievable how much hair she removed.\n\nI have never been so dissatisfied with a service before, and this is my first Yelp review."

1,"I went to Beckett's Table on a Wednesday night with the fabulous Aileen B. I was dying to try this place because she made my mouth water after reading her review. The pictures that on on yelp do not do this place justice. It is alot bigger than it appears and it is wide open. They are also already expanding the patio after only being open for a few months. \n\nWe started off with some drinks, I had the classic painkiller which reminds me of a pina colada and you do feel like you are on a beach somewhere sipping on a cool refreshing drink. Aileen had a glass of white wine which for the life of me, I cannot remember but she did enjoy it and that is all that counts. We ordered some mac and cheese and roasted brussel sprouts as an appetizer. OMG! People always seem to not enjoy the yummy goodness of brussel sprouts and believe me, this brussel sprouts were extra yummy. They were roasted to perfection and had shaved manchego cheese, pancetta, and had the sweet taste from the yummy lemon thyme vinaigrette. I am still drooling over those brussel sprouts as they really were that good. The mac and cheese was also divine. It was the creamy white mac and cheese with little bits of pancetta sprinkled very lightly over it. Between the brussel sprouts, mac and cheese and the warm house bread with the honey butter, who needs a main course? ME! duh. \n\nSo for the main course, I decided to order pork osso bucco. I was so excited about it because I had read how great it was in Aileen's review and I just had to try it. Well, unfortunately it was not all that great. The osso bucco was a little dry to me and I found that I am not a fan of spatezle as it had no flavor to me at all. I literally was moving my food around my plate like kid to make it seem like I was eating it. Aileen ordered wood fire mussels and she said they were good but needed a little bit more salt. I am not one to return my dish if I am not happy, but when our lovely waitress Rebecca came over to ask how the meal was, Aileen (bless her heart) let her know that I was not enjoying it. Rebecca asked if she could get me something else, but since I had my heart set on this dish, I politely declined. Well, to our surprise, Rebecca came back a few minutes later to let us know that they were not only comping the dish, but they were giving us the death by chocolate dessert as a treat. WOW! I was floored. That was very generous of them. The dessert was fabulous. Warm chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream and a oreo cookie that was dipped in white chocolate. Yum. \n\nThe drinks were delightful, the brussel sprouts were heavenly, the mac and cheese was creamy, the dessert was sinful, and my company was fabulous! Even though I did not like my main course, I will definitely be back to try something else as the service was great and they went above and beyond. Extra, extra special thanks to Aileen for inviting me and to my surprise treating me to dinner for my birthday."
0,"I showed up at the Pancake Cafe for a late brunch on a Saturday at 2:30 PM. There were a few people eating in the dining room. I stood in the lobby for about 7 min and was not helped or seated. Within this whole time, I did not see a single employee. I ended up leaving and going somewhere else. \nI do want to try the Pancake Cafe sometime, so I plan on going back. I hope I can update my review with a more positive experience after that. :)"

1,"Been going here for a little over 2 years and the owners feel like family. The food is always amazing and fresh, the owners are super friendly. You can tell the little lady gets joy out of making her food for people and she is damn good at it. \n\nI recommend the Pho, Vegetarian fried rice with veggies, Orange Peel Chicken and the Angry Chicken. Oh yeah, and the spring rolls are killer."
1,"A group of girls and I went out for a co-workers birthday and we ended up sitting out on the front patio while we waited for the rest of our group. We loved the music they played, they also play the music videos on the big screen outside. \n\nI had a Blue Moon and it was delicious, but my only complaint would be inconsistencies in prices. I paid $5 for my beer while my friend payed $6.50. Not sure what's up with that, but this a great place to \""pre-game\"" instead of spending $10 for the same thing at the surrounding clubs."

0,"I visited Macayo's because I heard that they had a gluten-free menu. \n\nWe sat outdoors on the cute, pleasant patio. The environment was somewhat marred by the presence of cigarette smoke. I know business owners can accept smoking on patios, but they can also choose to make patios smoke-free, and I find the latter much more pleasant. \n\nService was pretty good, but our server did seem in a hurry to get us out of there. Although it was 3 hours before close, she started asking if we wanted to-go boxes about 15 minutes after we got our food.  \n\nI had beef fajitas and my partner had a burro. We also ordered guacamole. The guacamole tasted kind of gummy, and the chips were too dry, papery, and flavorless. Also, we found cucumbers in the guacamole, and later in the pico de gallo. Who puts a freaking cucumber in either of those things?\n\nMy fajitas were very bland in flavor. The meat was cheap and had been chemically tenderized, with the result that the texture was pulpy. Instead of seared, it was just browned. It looked as though it had been steamed in a microwave, to be honest. Also, they used too much tenderizer, and it took the top skin off of my tongue. Gross. \n\nRefried beans tasted kind of cakey. Otherwise ok. Again, guac was gummy with a strange taste. \n\nMy partner said his burro was boring and had not much flavor. \n\nWe asked about flan, but learned that it contains gluten. There is ZERO reason that flan should contain any gluten, so I am guessing their flan was made from some kind of mix. Again, gross. \n\nI won't be returning to Macayo's."
1,Sensei Doug Clark is a warm hearted guy. He is down to earth and really understands traditional Shotokan Karate. I took my Dojo here for a tournament and he really made us feel at home. His Dojo is beautiful with wooden floors and a soft Japanese touch with a little modern taste. His black belts are some of the nicest people I know and extremely friendly. His students are extremely respectful and are very well trained. NSK is an amazing Dojo and I am glad we were able to come to his Dojo and visit. \n\n\nThanks Sensei Clark for the advice and hospitality he have given us!

I'm buying a $10 book at most three times a year, I don't need it!  They also don't take no for an answer well, they will get rude and hold up everyone else while you have to repeatedly say no.  If you give a reason why not they'll try to prove you wrong, just take my money and give me receipt so I can get out.  After this last time yesterday I won't be back."
1,"My aunt was excited to take us here for her birthday. Yup, take us out for HER birthday. She said she want us to try this place because it has authentic British food and if we don't like it, we can go somewhere else... ??? She said theres two location and she always go to the one in Tempe but she yelped and saw that the Mesa location isn't as packed as the one in Tempe. \n\nUpon arrival, I realized I've eaten here once before. Nothing too crazy but not bad either [: I just remembered that their fries are called 'chips' instead. \n\nWe were lucky and got seated right away for a party of 8. Of course we ordered the chips, some with garlic and some without and each of us got a different pasty to try. There was just so much options I couldnt pick from, so I asked the waitress which ones were her favorite and I settled for the Salmon one. Eh..\n\nChips with and without garlic were a bit on the salty side.\n\nSalmon pasty- a bit too fishy\n\nItalian pasty - my favorite! If I would have ordered this, maybe I would like this place more.\n\nCajun chicken - my second favorite, even got one to go for my mom ;]\n\nChicken alfredo - I felt like the chicken were a bit on the dry side.\n\nHamburger pasty - Makes great leftover! Microwaved and eaten with A1 steak sauce !\n\nI don't remember the names of the other ones but my sister got a mexicanish flavor and I didnt even bother to try because I dont really like that flavour. \n\nBUT the thing that made our night was the dessert!!! If you come here, make sure you leave room for some dessert pasty!\n\nOf course we were all full but my aunt gave glowing reviews about the dessert and we decided to try out some. Unfortunately because of the monsoon season in Arizona right now which makes it more humid (is that possible???), there were no strawberry meringes, so we stuck with the apple pasty and the PBJ with banana pasty.\n\nOh my, the apple was my favorite of the two because of the caramel sauce they filled it with. Heaven in your mouth. The PBJ was not bad either. I just wish they put more banana in it because the bites with the banana were the best. They have actual pieces of peanuts in there also which gave it a nice crunch. \n\nAll in all, I dont mind eating here again."

I contacted a lawyer who then said that they have to honor my current lease by law. Everytime I tried to get them to fix something in the home they refused. They kept coming out and taking pictures of my \""trip hazard\"" in my kitchen but then never fixed it. Instead they informed me that the owner was not making any changes until after the first tenants moved out. When it came time for my lease to come up for renewal I called the office multiple times and they kept dodging my phone calls and then I received a letter informing me that they were not renewing my lease!!!! They couldn't even give me a heads up on the phone the VERY SAME DAY!!!  I would never do business with this company after the way I was treated. HORRIBLE!!!!!!"
0,"Claim Jumper is one of those chain restaurants that gives you giant portion sizes, but the food really isn't anything to rave about. I went here with a few friends last Saturday after we had our comprehensive exam and it was just alright. I really wanted to order a soup and salad, but that lunch special is only offered on weekdays (which is weird...people don't want to eat something lighter on the weekends? hmmm) and in order to get soup and salad, even ordering the smallest portion sizes would have been around 13$ (which is ridiculous). So I ended up ordering the tomato flatbread appetizer and a cup of the potato soup. The flatbread was fine, nothing to get too excited about, but not bad. It had sundried tomatoes on the top and was a little garlicky. The soup, on the other hand, was not good. It was the weirdest tasting potato soup I have ever had. It had carrots in it and it just tasted almost sour. It started to separate (I could see the cream and the grease) before I stopped eating it about halfway through. My friends got sliders and sandwiches, which I guess is the way to go here  because they said it was fine, I just wish they had some half portion options or smaller salad/soup options for more reasonable prices for the kind of restaurant this is....a national chain."
0,"Oreganos is a fun restaurant and their food is pretty yummy. Portion sizes are Cheesecake Factory style -- enough to share or to take home for another filling meal. \n\nHowever, the restaurant is really dirty and for this reason I cannot give it more than two stars.\n\nI have been to this location many, many times. More than 20. Each time I go there are flies EVERYWHERE. Even our server was embarrassed and tried to explain why there were flies (apparently it's because I was wearing perfume) and lit candles at 2:00PM to \""attract\"" the flies. I spent most of my meal batting flies away from my food and hair. So gross.\n\nAfter looking around for to figure out WHY there were flies I noticed just how filthy the restaurant is: there are splatters of what I assume is food on the blinds and a build up of what look like years of crumbs on the window sills, especially in the corners. (The booths that line the walls are next to windows). It was so gross I wouldn't have wanted to touch the blind cord to open the shades without a Clorex wipe. Ew. I can't believe that this popular of a restaurant doesn't take the time to wipe down their windows -- even just once a month.\n\nI honestly don't think I will be back here anytime soon. I need to forget how grossed out I am before venturing back to this place. It very well could be that the flies were attracted to my perfume but if that's the case why am I never bothered by flies any where else?\n\nOn a positive note the service was great. \n\nSeriously, just clean the place and find a way to fix the fly issue."
0,"Fillaseat backed the vendor instead of the customer when I had a complaint. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth since I never received a resolution or so much as an apology. Therefore, I never went to the piano concert and have not booked any shows since. I believe my membership should have expired by now and I did not, nor do I plan to renew. There are lots of better ways to get bargain show tickets out there. I suggest you check Groupon and Living Social along with Yelp."
1,"zomg totally dont gamble here because they have clothed strippers (oxymoron) dancing next to the gamblin tables. You will lose all your money being distracted by them.\n\nAnyways, it is refreshing to see females dancing while I am losing all my money. It's like going to a strip club except I'm not giving my money directly to the strippers but to the craps table. Oh and of course, there are always chances of profit (which is not possible at an actual strip club) but I wouldn't count on it.\n\nJust to set things straight I dont stare at the strippers because I'm not a perv or nothing. They were just totally dancing in the area I wanted to gamble in. How annoying!\n\nYou are thinking, there are alternative gamblin tables at PH where no pole dancing is involved. Well, stop being a smartass."
1,"I had some time to kill earlier this week so I decided to stop in and have a look-see and I am sure glad I did.\n\nI have always been anti-junque stores, but this place isn't a musty old antique store. This place is brightly lit and the walk ways are kept reasonably clean. I do have to agree with other reviewers when they say that the place could be better organized. I thought that, but then realized you can't just keep changing each vendors booths location to fit what they are selling. So is stands to reason why there really is not a ton of organization to the place.\n\nSome booths have nicer more organized booths with finds that are of better quality (and price). I managed to find an old picture frame that I had set out to find, and I also walked out of there with an antique silk scarf in mint condition for $6. \n\nWhen I walked out of the store, I wondered where the last 2 hours of my life went. I also called my mom and apologized for giving her crap for all her years of antique shopping. Thanks to Odana Antiques, I am becoming my mother after all."

1,"I really enjoyed my visit to Edinburgh Castle. It's definitely a must-see in Edinburgh! The price was totally worth it. The architecture is majestic in itself but the fact that the castle is atop a hill makes it even more magnificent. The prison is probably the most interesting part despite the unpleasant smell. Also, the walk along the beautiful Royal Mile right outside the castle is a treat in itself."
0,"Do not waste your money. If I could give them a negative star I would. We got some passes for dirt cheap and decided to give it shot. It was not fun, some of their so called lab equipment was not working and at the end after you solve the crime they want you to pay for your certificate. You can also pick to get it email for free...umm I picked email but people who pay full price of 30 bucks and they still have to pay for a freakin certificate! Please stay away I promise you will be disappointmented."
1,"great product and excellent service, consistently, not a big fan of coffee but when i go it smells so good i always end up grabbing some.  \n\nlove the atmosphere, great concept"
1,"Still a solid choice.  Came here after seeing The Book of Mormon for a late lunch, dined on their larb again, chicken panang and some other items.  All was excellent, except the BBQ pork was on the fatty side.  Servers here are always super friendly."
1,The trip was amazing. We took the tour that landed in the canyon. Very professional outfit. The video was kind of stupid but I understand they probably have to do that for liability purposes. Sandwich wasn't good but who wants to eat when you only have 30 mins to check out the scenery?  Ask if they are running specials.
1,"This place rocks. I have been there twice and the staff is friendly, food is excellent and pricing is great. I will be visiting there often!!!"
0,"Yelp needs to make a zero star review possible because Thrifty totally deserves it! I went against my own instincts and booked with them because they were the cheapest and didn't charge a one way rental fee. NEVER again. Huge line and when we started there were 4 employees working which quickly dwindled to only 2. 45 minutes later we finally got outside to actually get our car. The lady tells us to \""take any of those 3 cars over there\"". One was being cleaned by quite possibly the slowest person ever so we went to the next one,loaded all of our luggage, and then saw writing on the windshield. I asked another employee about this and he told us the car was broken. At this point the other 2 options are gone. They did upgrade us to a Mustang, but it really was too little too late. Also after driving about 20 miles, the oil change needed light came on! Please avoid this disorganized mess."
0,This place has so much potential but falls flat. I ordered a chicken panini and had one bite. The chicken was dry and the panini bread was horrible. The only thing I ate off my plate was the fruit. I ordered a mimosa and basically got an oj with a splash of champagne. \nThe staff seems confused about everything and are all running in a million directions.\nAaaaand the hat stand in the bathroom looks ridiculous.
1,"Food was amazing, huge portions, forget hash browns, these homemade chips are the bomb!"
1,"Only Mexican Restaurant in town. Pico is legit, got to get the Guac, mariachi bands on Friday!"
1,"Enjoyed both meals I had here during recent visit to Vegas. Plenty of draught beer, PUB food with a twist, and awesome service! Highly recommend to those of you who love PUBs, but want something a bit more classy than your usual local dive. Of course you'll pay more...It's in Aria which is the newest hotel on the strip...But, if you can drain beers in 8 seconds then you get 'em for free!"
1,Been here once. Got the Italian special & the European sub. Both were really good! I tried both & couldn't decode which one I liked better lol. The sandwiches are actually 2 sandwiches when you order the full sandwich so you get huge portions! Not bad at all for $7 & change. Lots of other European goodies that I had never seen. Sweets too. I tried the kinder country chocolate bar. The girl at the counter said it was Germany's most popular candy. I can tell why! Yummy!!!
0,"I was sent here by the airline I was flying on. Not the nicest of hotels but it was free so i guess i cant complain. some of my findings here:\n\n- Staff was friendly and fast\n- Airport shuttle was small and uncomfortable but the driver was very nice and funny\n- Rooms are outdated and \""feel\"" dirty even though they are \""clean\""\n- Shower was...old and peely\n- Television wouldn't power on. I'm a stage technician so I know what power is and NO it was not user error. The power strip is bad.\n- Decorative pillows were dirty.\n\nSo all in all, for a FREE stay its tolerable. I would not spend money here though."
0,"We went here after finding a coupon on groupon.com.  The service was good and friendly and the restaurant was quaint.  It definitely has the neighborhood bistro feel.  The food... not so good.  We ordered the special appetizer with shrimp, tomatoes, and garlic bread.  The garlic bread was stale.  I ordered the Chicken Toscano, which sounded yummy with with artichokes, prosciutto and Mozzarella.  It tasted like Chicken soaked in butter with ham.  The prosciutto was probably the worst quality I have ever experienced.  My boyfriend ordered Sergio's Ravioli and I would say for $14 we could have gotten Costco's frozen pasta to last us a week and it tastes much better!"
0,"I've been coming here for a couple of years now and like a few others it has become a habit. \nI am NOT one of those freaks that comes here on Thursday and waits outside for the place to open so I can run in, grab a shopping cart and fill it with every single item that has a specific tag color and then makes the rest of the shoppers stand in line for eons while the cashier has to ring up their 100+ item purchase.\nWE come here looking for bargains, yes, but just a couple things here and there and often times the full price items.\n\nWhat don't they have?\nWell that really just depends on the day.  This place has darn near everything, including empty liquor bottles.  Why?!\nYeah, even Goodwill has trash on the shelf for sale sometimes.\n\nSome things are priced fairly, and then there are things that are just outrageously priced.  You must be a good shopper to know if you're being ripped off.\nFor example, I can get dog beds at Costco for less than $20 and they had the same one here, used/dirty, priced for $20.  Now tell me that's not ridiculous.\n\nI will suggest you not feel conned into giving any more of your money when the cashier asks you to make a donation. \nDo some research and you will see that Goodwill already makes a great profit and what they give to the community isn't nearly as much as those commercials say."
1,"Clean rooms, friendly staff. We were very impressed.  Stayed here for 2 nights during a last-minute trip to Madison.\n\nRoom has full kitchen (with utensils and storage containers - nice touch), living area with TV, computer desk, fold-out couch.  Bedroom has comfy linens and nice lighting, bathroom clean and separate vanity area.\n\nWalking distance from a little strip mall with a pub we really enjoyed and other little shops.\n\nOnly thing we didn't care for (and this was NOT the hotel's fault) was all the little kids down in the hot tub late at night.  Parents, I beg of you, get your kids with their arm floaters OUT of hot tubs when you see adults wanting to use it!\n\nNice job, Homewood Suites.  We would most definitely stay here again."
1,"So I had just gotten back from Barcelona (not the restaurant, the city) and fell in love with Spanish food. So when I came here I saw squid ink ravioli with lobster cream sauce. YUM! I'm all over it. Sadly, my poor friend had extreme morning sickness so I could not get all the unique items and we had to dine and run. but i would definitely go back and order a cocktail and eat this again. i love the ambiance, very modern and fun. Good for girls night out."

0,"We used to really love going to Oaks on the weekends for a family breakfast, but sadly over the past year it has just circled the drain.  The food hasn't really changed, it's still the greasy spoon type breakfast food you would expect, but the service is atrocious.  Unfortunately it appears as though the owners have taken to hiring their kids (literally) as servers and unfortunately it seems like they really don't want to be helping out in the family business.  Getting your drinks, a menu, a refill, hot sauce, your order taken, etc doesn't seem to be on the list of things they would rather be doing.  It's a shame, and I am sure we will still go there occasionally but we certainly don't really look forward to it like we used to.  It's not really representative of Cave Creek."
1,"Love this place! The italian ice tastes exactly like it's description.  The toddler loves the Starburst Strawberry flavor the most.  I love getting a mix of the vanilla frozen custard with the cherry italian ice. They also have a mobile app you can download for free and you can scan each visit and on the 10th one, it's free!  Also, don't be shy to ask to sample any of the flavors. They are really nice about it."
0,"Wow the cashier must have been 10 maybe 11 years old! I understand family owned business, when it comes to my money I would like an adult at the register. Upsets me when someone just hands you back a handful of money and doesn't know how to count it back!  Customer service 101 is smile thank the customer for the business and count your change back! furthermore I Arrived at 10 o'clock and are pretty much out of donuts!  Don't know if there be second chance for this establishment"
0,"I rarely guve low reviews... but the pictures are deceiving.... servings are super small and food over priced. The rolls are decent but gone in two bites.... everything else we ordered (fish n chips, calm chowder) was not very good to be honest..."
0,"Yesterday I ventured into Roka Akor as it is near where I've recently started working. \nI am a big fan of sushi places. I may not be into eating the fish but I am all about some miso, veggie tempura and veggies rolls (...and whatever else I find minus meats).\nSo upon finding myself on a closing shift and hungry I called them up ordering a bowl of miso soup-$5 and an order of veggie tempura - $6. i was told it would be about 10-15 minutes so I waited 10 and headed over. I spent a bit of time waiting at the bar where the bartender was friendly but very obviously busy.  It looked like the drinks were well poured and I found myself thinking maybe a night after work I could gather some friends up and have some drinks, dining & fun. I will say that this place is decorated beautifully. \nOn to why there are two stars. I was delivered my bag and I walked out to my car did a quick glance to see there was a bowl and a box in there as I was walking. \nI returned to my desk and busted out a small bowl of miso soup which was half filled. The tofu looked as if they had fried it. It was ok. I've had much better that was more cost proportionate. I had hopes well, maybe that was a mistake and some how I ended up with a complimentary side version of miso instead of the appetizer. I shrugged it off. I then opened into my veggie tempura, how disappointed was I to find seven pieces of bland vegetables. Had I not looked I would not have really been distinguishing the difference between the vegetables, just so you know my taste buds are not damaged (non smoker, 1-2 a month if that drinker). Now completely disappointed and irritated at myself for wasting eleven dollars here when I could have gone to anywhere else near by to get a portion of something that was actually filling. I still clung to the idea that maybe this was a mistake where the portions were incorrect but alas upon my phone call to their manager today it seems that is what should be expected from this particular place. I will stick to other sushi places that give me more than a double shot of miso.  As you have probably figured out I'm not coming back.\nJust for fun, I'll post what I saw when I opened up my food from Roka so you know what to expect."
0,I'm gonna give this only 2 stars BC the service seems to always be slow. I keep saying to my self we will never go back but we have been coming here since my oldest was 4 and today she is 14. \nThe server was all over the place but she was good I guess. \nFood was pretty good. A few new items on the menu.
0,Mediocre food. Had fish and chips. Fish was overcooked and coating was charred. Chips were soggy and flavorless. Kitchen was SLOW. It took over an hour from when we were seated until we were served our entree. This might be a good place if you want to drink a lot of beer and don't care when your food arrives or what it tastes like.
1,"I went to the Wine Cellar as part of a group from my job. This is the kind of environment I really enjoy- beautiful colors, warm lighting, quality furniture, leather and wood- I'd love a room in my house to look like this!  I enjoyed looking through the old collection of wines and finding ones bottled the years my parents were born (1930s).  We enjoyed a couple of different wines (I'm not much of a drinker) and some nice hors d'oeuvres.  Because this was an event hosted by my job, I have no idea about pricing.  All I know is that I would love to come back and curl up with a magazine or two in one of those nice, cozy chairs."
0,"I went to dinner with my parents and ordered a steak. Everything was great, but as I cut into my steak I cut into a paper wrapper that was left on? The manager/waiter was nice and brought out a new steak, but by the time it came out we were done with everything else. Basically, it ruined my meal and in return ruined our family dinner. The manager have us a free piece of cake, but really since we had to take the food home and will probably never reheat it the food that was messed up should have been comped. \n\nWe all agreed that we will not be going here again. \n\nIf you do go -- do not order a steak!"
1,"Love zia records. They always have great deals on cds, blu rays and whatnot. The staff is always very helpful and kind.  I highly recommend for about anything you are looking for."
1,"The chocolate custard is amazing, though I didn't enjoy the Italian Ice nearly as much.  On my first visit the employees were very helpful in explaining the menu. We tried several samples of the Italian Ice. It has an interesting taste and texture, just isn't for me. The person I was with preferred the Ice to the custard. A large cup is about $5. Check Yelp deals for discounts, it can save you half. Coupon or not, the custard is rich, creamy and well worth the price. Beats any yogurt or ice cream in town! It should come with a surgeon general warning \""May be habit forming.\"" (I've been there 3 times now.)"
1,"Pekara has recently become my go-to spot if I want to spend a few hours sitting downtown. The coffee is good, the service is friendly, and there's a great selection of food whether you are looking for a snack, a meal, or something sweet.\n\nThe crepes and the omelets here are outstanding! Especially the vegetarian options. And all the pastries and baked-good I've had are delicious.\n\nThere are a few tables out front and a patio in the back if you want to sit outside. In the back, they have a couch and an armchair and a taller table that works well for small groups.\n\nThe only weird thing is that they don't bring cutlery out when you order the food so unless you think ahead, you have to walk back over to the counter. Not a big deal, but it would be a nice thing for them to do."
0,Its our second time here and they messed up our order both times and the service is horrible.
1,"I got to talk with \""Crazy Ken\"", he is a great guy and kept encouraging me to go group riding which i will do. I literally came in to burn time, but to be honest i had the best experience i ever had in a bike shop. No one gave me snobby looks, he listened to my confusion and self proclaimed cluelessness for what i was really doing. He helped me out a lot. We got to talk a lot about my bike, and i am pretty sure i want this to be \""My bike shop\""."
0,"TERRIBLE! \n\nWow, I hate to leave bad reviews hence I haven't but this place is terrible and I must warn you. I am only giving one star because I can't give zero stars. The staff was great but the place is really a dump. We chose this place because we brought our dog and this place may be dog friendly but it isn't human friendly. lamps were not turning on, stains on carpet, drapes and towels. I did not take a shower because I didn't have any plastic bags to wrap around my feet. We used a pair of socks for \""walking on the carpet\"" that I will throw away after. I also am glad I had my tetanus shot and our Yorkie has been vaccinated!"
0,"We really wanted to like the Compass because of the great views, but cannot recommend it for a couple reasons. First, even though they had tables, they made us wait for our reservation time in the bar downstairs. It is a dumpy sportsbar with a surly bartender and we felt completely out of placed all dressed up for a nice dinner. When we finally got a table (and by then there were dozens available), the service and view was outstanding, but the food is poor quality. Creative ideas for sure, but gristly duck and too salty even though we asked for no salt. The wine list is limited and forgettable. If you really have to have the view, go at sunset for a couple appetizers and go somewhere else for dinner. Finally, at the end of the night, even thought we spent over $200 (including $15 / each for drinks), they charged us another $12 for parking. $2 discount with validation, that is incredibly insulting on their part."
1,"There was really no part of this meal that was anything but spectacular.  I probably can't add anything new to this slate of almost 700 reviews on here, but if I came back again, I wouldn't do it any differently: start with a couple cocktails, oysters and steamed mussels, move on to french onion soup and a bottle of burgundy, and then finish with the poulet roti, perfectly roasted and juicy chicken served over some kind of potato and apple (?!) slaw sitting in jus.  It was all amazing.  Also, the spaghetti squash with honey glazed cranberries, while not exactly the highlight of the meal, tasted exactly like christmas.  You'll know what I mean, even if you're Jewish.\n\nWe got out of there for around $120 a person, and I have to say I feel like as far as fine dining goes in Vegas, we did alright.  If there was a Bouchon in Chicago, I'd be back in a heartbeat."
0,"I am a huge fan of In-N-Out, but at this location I had a HORRIBLE experience. I ordered my food to go with some friends and when I took a bite of my double double I saw that there was MOLD on the bottom of my bun. I was so disgusted I could not eat for the rest of the day. The other people in my group had nothing wrong with their food, so I was the unlucky one. I contacted corporate about the issue and they sent me vouchers for two free meals during my next visit at any In-N-Out but I do not plan on going back for a while..."
0,I called and left a message and emailed them through their website over a week ago and never got any response back.  Bummer...
0,"The city has weak, overpriced drinks, an oftentimes shady crowd, slow bartenders and massive spillage everywhere.  The leather couches and chairs are this bar's only redeeming factors and there are about two dozen better places to grab a drink dowtown."
1,"Don't sew, don't knit, don't craft...but every once in a while I need things like a specific  blue thread to replace a button, or some fabric dye to revive a pair jeans that have faded from black to to \""graphite\""...  Everything was easy to find, and the staff, while unenthusiastic, was helpful.  Fabulous thread selection.\nThey have a great setup for buying a sewing machine - all are set up so you can try them - very nice!  Almost temped me to believe I ought to get one, but then I came to my senses."
0,"A few months ago I went to this place at lunchtime. Looks like a nice place. I went in and waited at the front stand to be seated. No one came to the waiting area. I said \""HELLO!\"" a few times. There were about five tables taken and plenty of empty tables available. I waited another five minutes or so and left. Not impressed..."
1,"Oh my heck! I ate here for the very first time yesterday and was absolutely enchanted by the experience. Initially, it is an intimate dining experience without any unnecessary trappings. The restaurant was quiet, clean and comfortable. The owners are, frankly, as charming as was the food. The food service was personal and prompt. They were very attentive to me. While enjoying the food, I observed several customers enter and interact with them and have the firm conviction they are this way to everyone. \n\nWhile the interpersonal dynamics alone would be enough to bring me here again, they paled in comparison to the taste of the food. \n\nI decided to try the Greek Sampler Plate to get an overview of what they did well. On the spur of the moment, I decided to go for a cup of the Shorba soup also. I was asked if I wanted it spicy and answered in the affirmative. \n\nThe soup was incredible! Halfway through I was regretting not ordering a bowl of it. The \""heat\"" was barely noticeable, but enough to accentuate the subtle nuance of the broth. I drained that cup just as the Greek salad was brought to the table. \n\nThe salad was perfectly dressed. All the greens were covered in a perfectly light but flavorful dressing--not saturated in it. The salad was much bigger than I had anticipated and I was concerned about my ability to finish the rest of my meal. \n\nNevertheless, I endured and am glad I did. The dolma was tasty, the potato-eggplant dish was divine, but the topper was the gyro meat which was the BEST I have ever tasted in my life! I told my wife I would swear off carne asada forever if I could guarantee a constant source of this meat. Alone or with Tzatziki sauce it was incredible. I knew I couldn't adequately explain to my wife how good this food was, so I decided to save some of it for her. Unfortunately, I just kept noshing on the meat until I had only a very little left. \n\nI will definitely be back here often. If you like good greek food at a very reasonable price. This is the place to go!"
1,"I have never tried Indian Food before, so I was excited. When my friend and I walked in at first we thought it was dead but when we came inside there was actually a lot of people. \n\nThe service was GREAT!! They are very attentive and very helpful. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and my friend ordered the Lamb Mango Curry. Both dishes was delicious.  Have to order the Peas Pillau and the Garlic Naan. And their Mango Lasse was very refreshing. \n\nMy friend and I loves to eat and try new places, since this was my first time trying Indian food. I would definitely let my friends know about this place and I would come back to try more of their dishes."
0,"while on the phone tonight around 7pm creating a large take out order with Lorna, my phone had issues. I called back to complete the order. during that call, my phone unexpectedly muted itself. after figuring out the issue, I said hello dozens of times.  seconds later, I hear Lorna and her coworker cussing and complaining about my phone issues. im not sure why she didnt hang up the phone before starting her venting. I heard the words f***ing b**ch, wasting my time with her bullsh**. her coworker told her to tell me to call back at 10 pm. I would not call back. you serve the customer when the customer approaches prepared to make an order. this was my first and last experience with this establishment. I wont hesitate to share my experience with friends,  family, coworkers, social media, etc. there is never an excuse to be that sloppy."
1,"Our go-to place for Chinese food in the Mesa/Tempe area! We love their Mongolian dishes, vegetable fried rice, kung pao, brown rice, Etc etc! Always great service & amazing prices!"
1,"My wife & I frequen this place. I live about 25 minutes away from this place but sometimes we are here 3 times a week. Our favorites are the luv-it special, western & banana split. My daughter likes the bumble berry. Sometimes I will order a pint of their frozen custard and usually it takes me longer to finish it than a regular half gallon of ice cream from the supermarket because it's very packed unlike store bought ice cream, which to me now is half air."
0,"Very disappointing.\n\nI came here recently with a friend hoping for flavorful Cuban food but we both found the food  to be mediocre as far as Cuban cuisine goes. I feel bad for leaving such a short review, but there just isn't much else to say. I can't complain about the service, wait time or the atmosphere, the food was just rather bland and very disappointing. \n\nI am a vegetarian and my friend a carnivore and we were both disappointed with the our meals. The food didn't taste horrible, it was just lacking in flavor (think Luby's) and we left with no reason to come back in the future. \n\nI have since heard that the Havana Cafe location down on E. Camelback is much better so will look forward to giving that location a try next time I am in the area. Hopefully I will have great things to report."
1,"This review is more general as opposed to a single visit, and applies to Soba post renovation. \n\nGoing here, the more expensive price is expected, and honestly worth it. I don't mind paying more money when the food is delicious, the service great on all levels, and the ambiance enjoyable. Soba achieves all three with flying colors. The first time I came with a large group and sat in the main dining area, and we were accommodated very well with fast flawless service. We ordered a variety of dishes and I can't say I disliked any. I normally hate tofu, but I even enjoyed the fried tofu dish. I've come back twice since then, to eat in the bar area. Whether the place was crowded or less busy, there was no variation in the high quality of food and the speed and friendliness of service, a rare accomplishment. \n\nMy advice for people coming here is to order a bunch of appetizers to share. The variety of flavors and foods is remarkable and it gives you a chance to experience the diversity this kitchen is capable of without investing a lot in one dish. That isn't to say that the entrees aren't also amazing, but this will help you have an idea of what you like best here and pick entrees that suit your tastes. But don't forget to make space for dessert. Their drink menu is also quite extensive, especially their offerings of a variety of sake to suit any dish or preference ranging from a standard carafe of warm sake to some limited edition bottles. \n\nIf you're in the mood for Asian food and want some great fusion cuisine, this is the place to go. It's also a great place for a date or happy hour with colleagues/clients. Happy eating!"
1,"Very helpful staff. Buying a birthday gift and had no idea what to do or what to ask for. They took the time out to explain every little detail. They were not only knowledgable about all kinds of products, but they weren't trying to sell you anything, just giving information. You also get to try the different types of liquid before you buy. Good deal!"
0,"I've eaten here three times over the past 5 years and I've been disappointed each time. Sometimes it's because they mess up my orders, sometimes it's because the food is just underwhelming or simply not fresh. I know people who like this place a lot, so perhaps I am just unlucky."

1,"There's finally a great donut place on the West, West Valley! I used to have to drive to the maryvale area for donuts but thank goodness Daily Donut is here in Avondale! These donuts are made fresh daily! Still fresh when I got there around 11am. I had the ham and cheese jalape\u00f1o crossaint which was light and flaky (not so greasy) and of course a dozen of their signature donuts. My favorite are the old fashioned and they are light and not overbearingly sweet. I can eat them all day! You have to stop by and try them out AND they have boba! All reasonably priced. Great to have a local family owned establishment that's clean and Terry and Hank are such nice people! Excellent customer service!"
1,I never knew that they had a sushi bar but my first experience there was during their monthly all you can eat day. It was amazing! Def would recommend trying sushi here at least once! You might get hooked!
1,"Like the other review, I purchased the groupon due the proximity of where I lived. The booking process was quite simple, as Annette has it set up online. Her place is located inside a business complex, so it can be tricky to find, but it's in the front of the building and there's a little sign. \n\nAs for the massage, one word sums it up, amazing! Annette listens to where your trouble spots are, takes a genuine interest in what you are looking to get done and does an amazing job. Her lotion is her own blend, and opens up your senses as she goes (and the smell doesn't linger after you walk out). She has amazingly soft hands and just that perfect touch that you're looking for in a massage. She is definitely worth the trip and I cannot wait to book my next massage with her!"
1,"Love this place!  It's the people from Cheesecake Factory and 24 hours!  And, even though, it's in the Palazzo, the prices are not that bad.  Nuff said!"
1,"I had a coupon to try this place a few weeks ago, and I had a great experience... Laura did my eyebrows and she did a fantastic job.  She was sweet as can be and professional too.  They offer other kinds of waxing here also.  I made an appointment ahead of time, but I think they are pretty good about walk-ins and last minute appointments also.  The Brow Lady is located in a convenient location and it's small and comfortable inside.  I'll be back to see Laura again soon for sure!\n\nInteresting history of 'The Brow Lady' also... read about it at:  http://thebrowladyusa.com/The_Brow_Lady.html  This is the kind of local business that makes you feel good to support!"
1,"Been here plenty of times and always encounter SOMEONE on staff with an attitude! servers at the Red Embers restaurant are slow forgetful and act like me asking for good service is such a hassle! Thank God for Claudia, the bartender at the bar in that area! She always goes around to the tables the patio wherever, to make sure everyone has their drinks food or has even been helped. Went with a group of co workers ordered drinks waited around 5...10....15 minutes and Claudia came over, she must've seen us looking around thirsty, and asked what we ordered... No writing anything down just went straight to the bar got our drinks and came back with them BEFORE the server ever came back to ask what we had ordered again! As far as the place it is a great environment, so many things to do and great place to meet up for drinks, dinner, arcade, bowling whatever. Just wish there were more people like Claudia on staff!!"
1,"A great deal for awesome Pho.  I've tried Pho at 2 or 3 places in Phoenix, and can't say that I know what Pho is \""supposed to taste like\"", but I crave this.  The amount of cilantro, basil and razorgrass (?) that comes with the Pho really adds to the flavor.  \n\nFor anyone complaining about service, I think that it is more an issue of expectation - they bring my food within 10 minutes of ordering.  They fill my water glass if they notice it.  It's better to think of this place as being more like \""cafeteria-style\"" rather than a sit down restaurant - they're curt, but quick, which they have to be considering how busy they always are.\n\nAlso, it's so affordable, I can eat here without feeling like I'm dining out since I don't think I could make such good food for less at home."
1,Can't complain.  Asked for a shot of espresso and it's served as expected.  Nice interior and their prices are very reasonable.  Nice addition to that area.
0,"My wife and I went on a Tuesday with two of our friends who are Vegas locals so at least we got the 2-for-1 deal.  Didn't like the darkness. I like to see what I am eating.  But maybe that was better,  because I didn't have to look at my chicken marsala that was drowned in what I think was a dark brown sauce the consistency of mud.  The mushroom risotto I got with it was bland and watery.  My wife got the chicken parm and left half of it on her plate.  The salads that came with the meal were tiny. \n\nGuess you are paying for the speakeasy theme because the prices they charge are way too high for what they give you,  plus you are forced to order way overpriced drinks to get the 2-for -1 deal.  Would have rather they had better food. The only things keeping it from a one-star review were the cheesy garlic bread,  the interesting way you enter the joint and the nice waitress."
0,"I had the worst dining experience here that I've had in about five years.  When we arrived, the dining room didn't seem too busy.  (After we had been there awhile--and had already ordered-- a large group that can only be described as Mesa's version of Comic Con arrived.)  We sat down and ordered an appetizer of garlic knots (ultimately delish when they finally arrived), a sandwich, and a pizza.  We asked for 1/4 of the pizza to not have any toppings, just cheese, so that my three year old could share with us.\n\nWe waited a half hour for the garlic knots.    After about 20 minutes, I asked the waiter how long they usually take.  He responded that they take less than 10 minutes.  He promised to follow up with the kitchen, but never returned.  When I raised my concerns to the manager, she said there were only two workers in the kitchen, which was causing a delay.\n\nThe pizza and sandwich took approximately 25 minutes more.  When the pizza arrived, it was not made correctly.  Instead of being just cheese on 1/4, and all toppings on the remaining 3/4, it was all toppings on all, but only using 1/4 the amount of normal cheese.  :(  As a result of having so little cheese, it was burned, and had the taste/texture of a burnt cracker.  The waiter offered only to return it to the kitchen to have it remade.  With two hungry kids, and Mesa Comic Con in full swing, that did not seem like a palatable option.  Instead, we requested a plain cheese piece (they sell them by the slice and then heat them up quickly) for my son.\n\nWhen the bill came, we were surprised that we were charged fully for everything--the 30 minute garlic knots, the incorrectly made pizza, the slice of cheese pizza.  I didn't expect them to give us the whole thing free, but seriously?  The waiter apologized and assured us if we came back he \""would take care of [us].\""  How about taking care of us this time?  (He ultimately removed the $2.50 slice of cheese pizza from the bill at our request.)\n\nWe were terribly disappointed with the speed, the service, and the food."
1,"I don't normally write reviews on places but I actually liked this Del Taco. The lady at the drive thru is a little hard to understand but she's sweet and smiles and is polite. That goes a long way in my book. It's clean, the wait is pretty short, and it's close by."
1,"I haven't met a donut I didn't like here at Rainbow Donuts.  The old-fashioned donuts, chocolate bars, and french crullers are my favorites.  They even make croissant breakfast sandwiches, which also hit the spot on the mornings that we come here.  Don't bother with Dunkin Donuts if you want authentic donuts at great prices.  The service has always been great and the young lady who works here is always smiling.  :)"
0,"Worst service  EVER waited over 10 minutes to get drink or drinks, 45 minutes and our appetizer still had NOT arrived. Asked to speak with he manger he too do not arrive. 1 hour and 5 Minutes our meals finally arrived the noodles on one plate were COLD like taken out of the refrigerator. \n\nI would NEVER go back..."
0,I'm sad. I'm sad I recommended this place to friends. I'm sad I referred them to be talked to the way they did. Looking for a discount on 2 Daniel def AR15s. They were priced 1499.00 each. Everywhere else in town they are 1300 to 1379. We asked why and we're givin a long run around. When my friend decided he still wanted it they said it was 1799 now300 more then it was just 5 days ago. When we questioned that he said it was a mandatory price increase from the manufacture. 6%. Sorry but basic math is not 300 bucks in my book.  With that said Tony said I'm just a manager and got bent. We left I won't ever be back. It saddens me. It truly does.
0,"It's a shame that I have to give Downtown Grand one star- even with the weird shower, and the location making the rooms noisy, I liked it. But it's run by very poor management, with little organization (with one exception, see below.) I work in the industry and these people should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nMy husband and I stayed the night on 12/23/14 - he had a job interview downtown so he brought his suit with him. (We were in the process of moving from San Diego to Vegas.) When he got back from the interview, the company called to offer him the job! In the excitement, when we left to check out, he accidentally left his $500 suit there. He realized it an hour after we left, and immediately called. They found it, logged it, gave us a confirmation number and told us they hold onto it for 30 days. Since then, he's talked to them twice on the phone and has been told the suit is still there. \n\nToday my husband finally had time to retrieve his suit- so off to Downtown Grand he went, only to be told they didn't have any record of his suit and they changed their policy (without calling us) to only hold items for 7 days, so it's gone by now even if they did ever have it. \n\nNow tell me - what kind of hotel has that kind of policy? I have worked for two casinos, one boutique hotel and one resort - nobody has a policy like that. The last hotel I worked at, an item of high value had to be kept for 90 days. And they have all of our information- why would we not get a phone call? Or an email? SHADY!\n\nAfter being told his suit wasn't there anymore, my normally very calm, mild-mannered better half internally lost it and had to walk away. This is his favorite suit. So I called to figure out what was happening. After almost a half an hour of holding (really downtown grand, you're that busy when there's an angry guest on the line?) I finally got a front desk manager and explained the situation. She told me she hadn't heard of a 7-day policy. She connected me to Edwin, who I talked to at length. I have to admit, at this point I was furious and he could sense that. After a bunch of people \""looking\"" for the suit, Edwin found it after not even ten minutes. He also let me know their 7-day policy has been in effect for quite some time, even before our stay, so for so many departments to not know such a big piece of information, there is clearly a huge problem with internal communication.\n\nSo how does a $500 suit get lost, but once I called and made it clear I wasn't accepting that answer, it gets found? I let them know my next phone call would be Metro for stolen property, or I would get in the car and come help them look. Then the suit gets found. Now my husband has to go all the way back there a second time. I'm disgusted with the way they handled this situation- I will never ever stay at this Motel 6 in sheep's clothing again. If you're going to be bringing anything of value on vacation with you (and I'm sure you are), I wouldn't risk staying at Downtown Grand."
0,"We came here on a Saturday.  The first time I tried to go in, they told me that my friend was too drunk to get in -- which was annoying since I was clearly the drunk one.  No wait, I mean -- we were fine.\n\nWe got in later, and it really wasn't worth it.  There was no one inside, the dance floor was pretty crappy and they wouldn't let any of us sit even though none of the tables were taken.  That was kind of annoying.\n\nThe bouncers just seemed like jerks.  I guess if you have a pass to each of the clubs you could come here for a drink.\n\nAnyways -- they ended up closing and kicking us out at 2am.  I guess they even realized they didn't want to be there."
1,Bree was cool!
0,"So I had stayed here before and it was always ok- decent, clean, and a great location to ASU. What has happened???? This place has gone down hill fast. First, it sounded like a herd of elephants was above me- not entirely the hotels fault, but had me wondering if it wasn't just a cheap hotel with thin walls. Second, there were three pillows for a room with a king bed AND a sofa bed. Hello? How cheap can you get??? When we asked for an extra pillow or two, they said \""we will see if we can find some\"" and never brought them up. I also requested extra towels at check in, but I did not receive them. The room was never cleaned. That means no trash emptied, no new towels, nothing. We were gone almost the entire day, and when we came back they had never been in the room. We went to the front desk to \""complain\"" and there was another guest complaining about the same thing. The did NOT apologize or anything. gave us a basket already made up with clean towels and toiletries. How often does this happen that they have the baskets all ready for customers when they complain?? As I stated, I have stayed here before but will not be staying here again."
1,"What can I say, I really like this place! I know the food ain't great and sometimes the crowds are a put-off. But you can't beat the charm of the antiques and whimsical oddities. And it has lots of big open spaces for groups of out-of-town guests or get-together with old high school chums. Lots of fun."
0,"Just returning from seeing \""wait, wait, don't tell me\"" live radio show. The show was fantastic and once in our seats, the view was great (even in the nosebleeds) and acoustics were fantastic. \n\nBut getting into the theater was more like wait, wait and then wait some more.  I was horrified at how completely unprepared they appeared to be to handle a sell out crowd. We initially waited in a line for will call that didn't move for 5-10 minutes at all. Then eventually started snail pacing along. Getting into the theater itself was a confusing cluster-mess of snaking lines leading every which way.  Once in the theater there was no one directing anyone anywhere. It was a mess. I was so unimpressed with the entrance, it is a good thing the actual show made up for the first impression. Not a venue I'm likely to return to anytime soon."
0,Dirty and way over priced...  $25 for 50 rounds.  Can't bring your own ammo.
0,"I stayed here on a family road trip to visit some relatives in Las Vegas. A convenient location off the Strip, this place is very much appreciated from being adjacent to the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nMy family and I had a late check in. The overnight agent was cordial and patient with checking myself in. He asked my preferences and did his best to accommodate. My family had forgotton some bags in the rental car and we asked the front desk agent to radio the Valet for the rest of our bags so we may change faster before an appointment in the morning. He radioed in front of us and the Valter/Bellman on the other side said, \""you're kidding me! I just brought all the bags up and parked the car!\"" The front desk agent looked embarrassed so he stepped away to talk to the Valet/Bellman. Momentarily, the Valet/Bellman appeared and repeated to the Front Desk agent, not even acknowledging us, that he couldn't believe we needed the rest of our bags. My sister stated, \""yes please.\"" He looked at us both frowning and upset and saying, \""I asked you if you had all the bags and you said yes,\"" confronting my little sister. She stated it was very early in the morning and she forgot two in the front seat. He gave a loud sigh and went back out. Please note, the parking garage is only steps away. \nWe described to him the two bags up front to have delivered to the room. When he came up to the room, he had brought the wrong bags, but being in a bad mood and apparantly showing us, we decided to get the rest of the bags in the morning...\nThe layout is easy enough. Very easy to get around... Inside there is a Cafe behind the Front Desk that serves Illy Coffee, major plus because that is my favorite coffee brand. But the cashier/barista was short staff. There was a line of 5 and she was by herself... hopefully, I'd like to assume they are not staffed like that all the time and I just happened to be there on another ones break. But no relief? \nThe room was okay. A typical room, but I'd expect more from a Renaissance brand. Also, the therapeutic bed did not fit the bed board. So when my sisters and I would talk on each others bed, we could feel the mattress slide underneath us, to fit the bed board. The walls are thin. We could hear the next room coughing...\nThe morning Valet were all cheerful! Tangerines during check in were a nice touch. The furniture may be too tacky modern for my taste. The television screens are good, but when my mother in the second room tried to hook up the internet connection from her laptop to her television in the room, it would not read. The pool area looked a little tired.  A little disappointing....\nWhen my family came back from the last night out they found a COCKROACH ON THE FLOOR IN THE HALL OF THE LOBBY! Now, I used to live in Vegas for a few, during the boom of the real estate... & I remember the houses of my and my neighbors' have to get rid of the desert bugs. But a cockroach in a hotel is a nightmare!!!!\nWhen they told me this in the morning, we talked to the Manager on Duty. She deeply apologized. I had to correct the folio, my mother had talked to someone that night to take off the bill because it wasn't working and this was not done. \nI'd only come back here unfortunately, just for the coffee :( It was not my forte :("
0,"I was surprised when we called ahead on a Sunday morning and asked to have our name put on a waiting list.  We were told that they weren't very busy, and they couldn't put us on the list until we arrived.  So 10 minutes later we arrived to find a 20 minute wait. \n\nI mentioned this on their Facebook page and got a snarky reply that pretty much suggested I could just shut up and wait like everyone else. \n\n\""The Original Pancake House franchise has been extremely successful for 52 years.  We've tried variations to the corporate policy standards, and it simply doses not work.  Since 1995, the Vegas locations have used the first come first serve method.  Thank you for your comment, but Even past presidents, celebrities and politicians wait on weekends and holidays.   There is no way to \""jump the line\"" except dine on weekdays when the wait is shorter.\""\n\nOddly enough, call ahead simply DOES work for restaurants all over the country, so I'm not quite sure why they can't figure it out.\n\nIn all fairness, the wait was probably less than 20 minutes- closer to 10 or 12 minutes, and the food was fast and very good, as always.  \n\nBut with this type of attitude displayed towards customers, the Original Pancake House won't be my go-to place for breakfast any time soon.  \n\nOr at least not THIS location."
1,"Been meaning to try this place for a while and swung by for lunch while running some errands.  Delish.  I won't write a whole review as I've only been once and had a lunch special.  The menu seems to be very pan-Asian influenced, with bold flavors.  If you like heat, ask for the side chile sauces, which you can mix in and increase to your desired level of pow.  The owners were incredibly nice and I'm afraid their lease is up, so it remains to be seen if they stay put.  If you like Asian food, give them some business... I think it would be a great place to take friends and share a bunch of dishes."
1,"Very chic hotel. Love it!  It's pricey but it's worth it, even if for one time.  We fit a group of 6 in here..a couple in the bed, one couple on the floor and then another on the pull out sofa bed.  Plus, there's a kitchen area, so you can def mix your drinks and just party it up in your room before heading out."
0,"I really hate to give this place 1 star, but I don't think it deserves much more than that after my most recent visit. I had been to this location once before about 3 months ago and it was a decent experience: nothing outstanding or overwhelming. The frozen hot chocolates are a great novelty to try, but it's heavy even for someone with a sweet tooth like me. \n\nFast forward to Labor Day Monday, 9/1/2014. My boyfriend and I checked in at the hostess stand and then waited 15 minutes for our table. It all went downhill after we were seated. After being seated for about 5-7 minutes, we looked around to see if there was a server around our area - our table and the table next to us seemed to be the only ones without a server coming around. After we'd hit that 10 minute mark, I managed to flag down a server walking by and asked her if she was the server for our table. She said no and pointed at another woman who she thought was serving our section, and she proceeded to go over and ask her to come over. I saw the other woman shake her head and continue with her business. \n\nThe server I talked to then came over and reluctantly said she'll be taking our orders now if we're ready. (No apology for the wait - it may not have been her fault, but the gesture would have been nice.) I appreciate that she was going to be serving us, but she seemed like we had totally ruined her afternoon and it just became more of an unpleasant experience. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and she had her own assigned tables to take care of - but if she didn't want to help us, she could have found a manager or talked to the hostess about who the proper server should have been.\n\nThe waters and food came out at appropriate wait times. The Meat Madness Pizza was extremely salty and my boyfriend found it inedible after eating 1/3 of it. I got the alfredo with chicken, it was edible but for the price I had expected better flavor. Portion was large and I didn't finish more than half. The garlic bread that came with the dish was hard and the spread was rubbery. \n\nBy the time we stopped eating our food, we were no longer in the mood to order a frozen hot chocolate. We got our check, mentioned to our server that the food wasn't great and she sorta gave us a nervous smile and walked away. \n\nI'm not sure where the mis-communication happened with our table and the server assignment, but I kind of wish I had gotten up and left when the idea was on the table. The frozen hot chocolate was good when I had it, but I won't be returning to this establishment again unless someone dragged me here."
0,"DEF a place for the ladies!  I finally popped in GWE this afternoon on the way home from a dr's appt (been meaning to forever).  Admittedly it's a quaint store, but obviously geared towards the female customer (more so than most other gift shops of this nature).  There's a little of this & a little of that casually-yet-deliberately showcased throughout.   The front of the store housed mostly candles (one of which I nabbed) as well as various bath & body goodies.  Another corner had local artwork and in the rear of the store there was a decent selection of those marvelous offbeat humor cards (something else I nabbed one of).  You can also pick up a few \""naughty\"" items as well (a blow-up husband was included in the selection), so be cautious if shopping with kiddies.\n\nOverall--for ME--I only found one gift I'll be back for as well as a few candles to make the abode smell spiffy.  Other than that it isn't tops on my list of stand-by shops.  I'll stick with Paper Skyscraper & the like.\n\nOH...I did get a helluva laugh out of their security sign on the floor across from the register that reads \""Not to worry, our security cameras will keep you safe.\""    LOVE IT!!!"
1,We went with a group of 14 people. Nothing but friendliness. Imagine a restaurant in America where the waitress brings everyone water along with other drinks - thats pretty cool. \n\nVelvet soup was recommended to us by friends and was great order a bowl and share with atleast 6 people. The Anthony's noodles and General Tso's chicken was superb.\n\nmenu prizes are very very reasonable - Don't miss this place
0,Sold me a 100.00 gift  card with a bouns 20.00 card for myself over the holidays. Went to use the 20.00 dollar card tonight and they told me it had already been used. Yes cashed in just one day before my 100.00 amx purchase. I guess they are into recycled plastic or rip off
1,"My friends bought me a prenatal massage gift card for Massage Envy, so I booked 90 minutes with Debbie recently. First, a 90-minute massage is ridiculously awesome, and I felt lucky to have the extra cash. Second, Debbie is fantastic.\n\nShe explained what she would do and encouraged my feedback, made me comfortable with a body pillow and comfy blankets, and was really attentive. But really, what's important is that Debbie is great at finding and releasing tension in the neck, back, arms, and legs. She did an amazing job. I felt better at the end of that treatment than I had in the previous 4 months of pregnancy. (Of course, anything feels better than the first trimester, but I didn't realize how badly I needed some TLC.)\n\nI'll definitely go back to this shop and plan to request her again. I didn't expect a national chain to be so good, and I was pleasantly surprised."
0,"This review is being written for the two food items that I tried. I am a pho'ckin pho aficionado. I have had great pho in every city I've ever visited and that is a whole lotta pho. I was drawn to this establishment because of the clever name. Once entering, you'll notice that everything is very clean and very open. The tables line mostly the borders of the restaurant with a few small tables in the center. It kind of reminded me of a fast food chinese restaurant. I became wary right away. I immediately noticed that my favorite appetizer was not on the menu. No egg rolls. Yeah...those delicious vietnamese egg rolls that you wrap with lettuce and dip in sweet fish sauce? None. There were no spring rolls either. So I continue to browse the menu and notice that it is more of a vietnamese/thai restaurant. I ordered the wontons with curry as my appetizer thinking it would be some type of fusion food. I also ordered the Vietnamese staple, beef pho. The boyfriend ordered a chicken pho. He's very White-American and doesn't know any better. I don't know why, but I had expected some actual dumpling-style wontons, but we got some fried wonton chips with a tiny dish of watery curry. Disappointing. I was served before my boyfriend was. I thought it was because it took longer to cook the chicken..or something, or maybe there was smaller stock of chicken broth/soup since most people order beef pho. I guess it just took longer to cook the chicken because he still got bowl of beef pho, just with chicken pieces instead of slices of beef. There was something about the noodles that just didn't taste right. Like, they purchased the packages of dried rice noodles instead of using freshly made rice noodles. It just wasn't good. I didn't think you could go wrong with a bowl of pho since it is such a basic food (like fried rice), but you can. If I ever go back, it would only be because it is literally across the street from my housing community. Perhaps the Thai food will be better."
0,"Oh, man!  Thank goodness it ended when it did because I was falling asleep.  Snore, snore.\n\nOf course, this hasn't been the first time I've fallen asleep at a Cirque show, but who's counting after having seen 14 different, official Cirque shows.  See all my reviews here on Yelp.  (link: http://www.yelp.com/list/my-favorite-cirques-las-vegas)\n\nFor me, this show was lacking... well, CIRQUE.  Other than the cool, Spider-man like trampoline act, this was only Cirque-est (like those cheap traveling acts that come through your town with Cirque rejects.  Actually, those fire breathers and dancers are quite entertaining, but I'm going off on a tangent).\n\nAnyhow, this is my idea of a high end lounge act... which, in Vegas, you can usually get free tickets to when you endure a couple hours of timeshare lectures.  (On a positive note, the singers are really good.  To which, this review would have only gotten one star without them.)\n\nNonetheless, if you paid and did not get a REFUND due to the pyrotechnics malfunctioning, the breakdown would follow:\n\n - $10 for the tribute video, one would pay at an Elvis museum\n - $40 for a good Vegas lounge act with no headliner\n - $40 for a Cirque-lite side show\n\nThat's a total of $90 for 90 minutes with no intermission, which leaves you in the nose-bleeds section of this show.  You do the math and see if it's worth your time and money."
0,"After reading the review on Charlotte.com I was anxious to try the new, and updated Dynasty.  Unfortunately my experience was very disappointing.  From the wait staff to the food, I was not pleased.  The staff ignored my table, and attended others, that arrived after us.  There was no explanation of the \""traveling carts\"" and once we requested a cart to come by, the food was cold, over processed, and very bland.  We tried a variety of steamed and pan/fried dishes, and they were all disappointing.  I will not return.\nOn a side note, I look to Charlotte.com to see what restaurants/dives/etc. are in Charlotte to try and this did not live up to what I read."

0,"A couple days ago, I came here for an early lunch with Donald. We had a coupon for $6.99 lunch that was good for up to four people. They open at 11am Mon-Sat and it was only 11:15am when we got inside. When we started going down the salad bar, I couldn't help but notice that everything looked like it was just uncovered from the night before. A lot of the salad was limp and majority of the toppings were almost empty. Considering they just opened 15 minutes before, it shouldn't have looked like that at all. In fact, one would think we would be getting the best of everything because it should all be newly stocked. That just wasn't the case here...\n\nWe looked at the menu online beforehand to make sure they had soups that we would like. The main reason why I wanted to go was for the Cream of Broccoli and Sweet Tomato Onion, so after eating some salad I went to load up on soup. I saw French Onion, chili, Cream of Broccoli, Turkey Noodle, Dill Potato, and Split pea. What was missing? The Sweet Tomato Onion!! Apparently they just don't follow their menu that's posted online because the Tomato Onion and Chicken Noodle were missing, but they had Dill Potato and French Onion, which weren't even on their online menu.\n\nThe only thing I really liked about my experience here the other day was that it was easy to find booth seating right next to the soup/pasta section because it was very early on a weekday, but that's not enough of a bonus to add another star."
0,"Just got back from a recent stay, chances are if you've found a good rate on the internet, so have alot of other people, and they may not necessarily be quiet!\n\nThe room itself was nice, clean, bed was comfy, hot water in the shower at night, ran out of hot water one morning, there was good pressure.  No refrigerator in the room, so that was kind of a bummer. Also, the bed pillows are feather.  All of them.  No extra non feather pillows in the closet like other hotels and I really didn't feel like trying to track down someone to get me some.  I want everything in my room and not have to work for it.\n\nWalls are paper thin we could hear our neighbors cell phone going off during the wee hours of the morning, and it took them awhile to answer, same thing with the alarm clock the next morning at 6:30 am.  seriously  needs better walls, and while we're at it insulated windows.  We had the unfortunate luck of staying in the part of the hotel facing the airport, hearing airplanes all night and even a siren and motorcycle or 2 even though we were on the 26th floor.\n\nAlso, the hotel is not well organized and there aren't many food options as far as something small and quick or a little something to hold you over until dinner.  Food court had a Nathan's Hot dog and McDonald's.  Another random hallway on the way to the parking garage had a cookie/bakery place where everything looked icky and coffee wasn't that great.  The sandwich we got at the Stage Deli was good, but the menu options were limited.\n\nAlso,There is a nice advertisement for the spa, but no prices, and the spa closes at 8.  We walked all the way to the other end of the property, to find they were closed, gated off, and no price list anywhere.  Walked all the way back to the concierge desk, oops they close up at 9.  Seriously?  The concierge had even left us a message saying if we needed anything, contact them.  No such luck.  Asked the employee who stands in the lobby and directs you to check in if they knew the prices, nope.   ARGH!  Very frustrating!  I saved some loot, but seriously MGM you lost out.\n\nSigns around the property are confusing, I know its probably on purpose to keep you wandering around the casino, but seriously, pissing me off while I'm trying to find something isn't going to make me want to plop down at a table and start gambling."
1,"This place gets a stamp of authenticity from me and did I tell you we are picky about our local food? It's as Singaporean/Malaysian as it gets based on the few dishes I ordered. \n\nI agree with some of the other reviews - for people who are not familiar with SG/MY food the pictures would be really helpful. While they may sometimes look like Indonesian/Thai food, the flavors are very distinctive. \n\nStarted off with the roti canai and I was pleasantly surprised that it's not the flat crispy frozen kinds served in most malaysian restaurants. It's thick like the real ones. The curry chicken that came with it was good too. I was also quite pleased that they had the penang yong tau foo, which is a dish with curry/laksa gravy and an assortment of tofu skin or veggies stuffed with fish paste. I asked for noodles with it. \n\nKangkong belacan was good, and husband ordered a teochew style steam fish, which was alright.  If I'm ever in LV again I'll definitely come by again."
1,"Ordered 10 pieces of Dim Sum to go. Was sadly disappointed by their limp unappetizing look. I expected proper Dim Sum but got steamed dumplings. Watch out. \n\nPriced too high (10 pieces here is more expensive than 15 pieces at Mai Xiang Yuan, which are awesome!) but they taste excellent. \n\nCan't decide between 3 and 4 stars, so I am rounding up.. but I would say 3.5 ;)"
0,"I am super disappointed. I have used Pretty in Pink one previous time and was happy with my experience, but this last experience was awful. They text me they would be at my house between 1 and 2 pm the day before the cleaning. Well on the day of they showed up at noon. No one was home as I was expecting them at 1pm. To make matters worse they went to the house across the street and said someone told them the house wasn't ready for cleaning. I called when I got home and they rescheduled me for Saturday which made me feel better about the situation and I verified they had my address correct. I arranged for my sister to be at my house as I was out of town and guess what-they never showed up! I still have yet to receive an apology from the company and they did not offer to reschedule the cleaning until more than a week out. I would not recommend using them based on this last experience."
0,I went on Halloween weekend and I wasn't a big fan of it . It was ok but most of the club was tables . The outside was pretty nice . But I left . I doubt ill be going back to surrender on my next trip .
0,"Let me start with saying that I'm an avid climber that works at a climbing gym in San Francisco. I have pretty high expectations but I work at an amazing gym and I have climbed at many other climbing gyms. To start, the bouldering wall was horrible. It was barely 7 feet tall and super small. About 90% of the routes were unmarked and almost all the holds were really dirty. So we moved onto the walls which were not much of an improvement. Again, almost none of the routes were marked and a majority of the holds were really dirty. The floors also had horrible padding so falling was a bit of a concern. I would highly recommend not going to this gym."
0,"Be sure that if you have a group on that you show and tell the waiter , the  host and the owner what's in your group ticket   If you don't they will try to over charge you and \""Assume\"" you want the extras and charge you! This is so upsetting all of the above were rude , unprofessional and especially the manager , threatening to call the police when they were in the wrong , after all that they waived the extra charges because Assuming to call the police was not putting a scare into us when they were in the wrong!!'"
0,"This is the worst Starbucks of all time. Drinks are always bad -- or completely wrong. Slow service. Disgusting bathrooms. Annoying baristas. \n\nI only go here if I'm desperate for caffeine, in a rush, and don't have time to walk to Royal..."
0,"A group of four of us went last night for the first time. I had purchased a Groupon, and was excited to check out a new winery. The service when we arrived was dismal. It took a tour leader from another group to flag someone's attention. We had reservations yet they acted surprised to see us. Given all this, if the wine had been great, we could have forgiven the service...it was not great. I don't expect the wine to be of Napa or Sonoma quality, but at least make up for it with your service.\n\nDisappointing, and I'll stick to other local wine bars moving forward. I honestly can't believe this place has an average of 4 stars..."
1,Went here for lunch today..not bad. Like everyone else says its not super nice and a little slow. But the Chimichanga I had was good (nice and crispy but not dripping with grease) and it was cheap. We were able to go here for lunch and be back within an hour. I liked it and will be back!
0,"I am very disappointed in my highlight and cut. I should have known it was going to be bad when the other girl kept coming over and teaching her how to do a highlight. If I wanted to go to someone that was still learning I would have gone to a school, at least it would have been cheaper. She did not even get to my roots (the whole reason I went). The cut is uneven and I will never return."
0,"The work was good, the service was awful!\nMy dog had an accident in my car.  (I was bringing him home from the veterinarians.)  I was afraid to clean it up myself and make things worse.\nSo the next day, yesterday,  I went to Fabulous Freddy's and spoke to a girl.  She said that I didn't need an appointment and the interior and exterior-including the mess could be done for 84.99.  Fine.  I go on line and saw the detailing for around 150?  Okay!\nSo I go today.  First guy gets someone else.  She tells me that dog poop is a bio hazard.  She asks a detail guy.  They talk.  Then she comes over to me and tells me it can be done but I would have to leave a tip!  I looked at her and told her that I had worked retail and I always tip.  She looked at me like I was out of my mind and said \""You did?\"".\nSo guy #1 tells me I have a chip in my windshield, we did fix that and my insurance is paying.\nThe car  was fixed beautifully.  Everything looks great!  I ended up tipping the detail guy-guy #2-$10.  He did give $5 to the guy who cleaned the seats.  He did make some comment about not usually cleaning up dog poop.\nI was willing to pay more but don't tell me I have to tip and don't tell me that dog poop is a bio hazard.  And I always tip!\nI was recommended this place by an employee at the veterinarian.  When I called my doggy day care place they said that dog poop is not a bio hazard they were shocked and asked if I spoke to a manager.\nThe car really looks good, but..."
0,"Went here a month ago b/c of a Groupon offer.  I should've passed on the Groupon and applied the money towards a better hotel.   We did not get a strip view (as promised on Groupon) upon arriving.  We asked to upgrade to a suite and was told they had it available which made me slightly happier.  After 30 mins of, an obviously new front desk worker, tapping away at his computer he tells us it is non smoking which is a no-no for us.  That started our trip with 2 let downs.\n\nThe room was decent, bathroom was decent.  Not decent enough for their regular price they charge tho.  Their casino?  Extremely boring.  I'm a Vegas head, I go once a month, occasionally twice and TI will be a last resort  if all the hotels on the strip are booked up."
1,"Always have a good experience every time I get my hair cut here. They also send out coupons, making their service even more affordable. I love the online checkin option, allows me to know when to show up- I don't think I have ever waited more than 2 mins. I definitely recommend them !"
0,"Well after a few recommendations and some yelp reviews we decided to try it. Over all a disappointment for all the hype. 50 minute wait. 30 minute wait from the time we ordered appetizer until food arrived...uhm before the appetizer. I had 3 way overpriced \""street tacos\"" crispy fish, shrimp, and shredded beef. Both the fish and shrimp were cold, the beef barely warm...wife's were adequately warm. Over all tacos all kind of tasted the same was my wife's comment. I agreed. Appetizer finally came...ahi tostada (on the house at this point) it was good...but nothing to write home about...was not seasoned at all. It's amazing what a little salt and pepper can do for a dish folks. A double rum and coke set me back 14 dollars wtf? The moes definitely desert? Uhmmm runny and grainy boxed pudding, a clump of sliced banana, Carmel and salted pecans...pecans and Carmel were the best part etc...thrown together...but tasted pretty good...not worth 6 bucks. Our server was pleasant enough but forgetful apparently. Short term memory problems? Lol\n\nAll said and done ? 64 dollars for one app, two entrees, one desert and two drinks. \n\nI don't know what the uber positive reviews are all about I'm thinking you waited a long time and had a few too many by the time your table was ready hence...\""everything was so good\""...really over priced, under seasoned, poorly executed simple food. Trying to ride on the hipster local and decor  and forgetting that the food and service is the thing. \n\n We decided we will go try it one more time just make sure it wasn't an accident. Will update after."
1,"In all my visits to Vegas I can't believe I've never seen the Mirage Volcano!\n\nThis is certainly one of the Vegas Strip things you must do. It's free, need I say more. Head out at nighttime before the top of the hour to get a good viewing spot. However, don't get to close. I had to move further away because my eyes and face felt really warm for the large bursts of flames. On a cold night, this would probably be an awesome place to come warm up, lol."
0,"Came here craving queso- sampled prior to ordering and thank goodness. Tasted heavily of beer. Went ahead and ordered a taco salad after the dip trio came out and was decent. The taco salad is a must not. There was a ton of mozzarella on it instead of cheddar. The \""taco seasoned beef\"" was very familiar to a can of Hormel chili. The lettuce was already turning brown. Our salad was out within two minutes of ordering. The shell was glistening from oil, although it was fresh oil. I wish I had decided on Cafe Rio salad and not decided to try the queso. Being pregnant I already feel nauseated. The waiter was very pleasant and my water was fresh. Sadly, we will not be back. It's connected to a bar so don't expect anything beyond bar food. So if you are drunk... This may be what you are looking for. As for me I'd rate this below a taco bell salad for double the price."
1,"Although I have not been in many hotels, but with a history of working at a hotel increases my expectation of hotels. Even at the most high rated hotels disappoints me. This Resort, however is the most impressive I have ever been at.\n\nMy friend made the booking himself. I trust in his selections so I told him to plan my entire Vegas trip (my first time in Vegas at the age of 26; i'm a late bloomer). We saw the M Resort at a distant and I have to say, \""impressive\"". The building was beautifully standing and definitely has an alluring sensation about it.\n\nUpon our arrival, the service was instantly magnificent right off the back! They opened the cab door for us and greeted us with a smile. I was amazed by the entrance to the lobby. The glass made me felt like I was staying at a VIP hotel. (if it wasn't, it should be!)\n\nThe interior was stunning and breath-taking. The patterns and lighting made it most welcoming. The front desk agent was positive and informative about the hotel (what every front desk staff should be; informative).\n\nFrom the lobby, in the elevator and down the hallway of our floor that we were staying at, I couldn't help it but to take photos of everything I saw. The decor was perfect.\n\nAgain, not expecting much from the hotel rooms, I have to say my jaw dropped to the floor. The rooms was beautiful. The simplicity of the beds and bedsheets made me jumped into it. I loved it. We loved it.\n\nI wanted to sleep in it right away, but since we both haven't ate for over 36 hours (due to the fact that we spent the day before packing up for the 4 day trip in Vegas) we took the front desk agent (Terrance) recommendation (also the taxi cab driver's) to try the Buffet. It was rated the Best Buffet in Las Vegas. (Sure... I thought to myself) The line was a bit long and it ended up a 45 minute wait. I was hesitant at first since I wasn't crazy about waiting and being hungry made me a bit bitchy, but since I was too lazy to walk around and look for another restaurant in the hotel and I felt like I could've eaten a horse, I decided to wait it out.\n\nIt was the most expensive Buffet I ate at but holy cow... totally worth the moola; totally worth the wait. They have over 250 selections! I thought that was a bit much but if you really think about it, that's how much a buffet should have! Every dish was made as if specifically for you (and not by quantity; well, it certainly tasted like that). It was sensation. I recommend everyone to try the buffet. Drive or cab it there, I guarantee you you will not be disappointed.\n\nEven our housekeeper (Teresita) was fabulous in her details of cleaning. My friend and I crowded the counter area in the bathroom with our products of shampoo, locations, deodorant, toothbrush and other millions of essentials needed for the bathroom area. While we left the hotel (on our 2nd day there) to walk along the Vegas Strip the housekeeper cleaned our room. We went came back, she neatly organized our stuff on a towel on the counter. Refreshed our towels and neatly did our beds and other housekeeping stuff. I was in love w/ the Hotel. We were in love with the M Resort.\n\nWe also ordered room service. (we like to do everything we can and experience everything). The food was excellent! The girl that took our order was fantastic and patient with us.\n\nI can't speak for him (for i'm sure he has even more fabulous things to mention about the M Resort) but I am definitely staying at the M Resort. Even if all of my friends stays on the strip, I'm staying at the M Resort if/when I return to Vegas next time.\n\nThank you for the fabulous experience!"
1,"Ok great Mom and Pop place. This is one of those places that you are glad to find on Yelp because they is only one of these. As far as Mexican food place this is a great find. A little of that sonoran style cooking witgh a little authentic north Mexico flavor. I always go by the beans. The beans reminded me of the beans my mom makes at home. They were made today and not out of a can. And the chips and salsa are good. The salsa has a bite to it so if your are mild salsa person, beware.I recomend this place"
1,"Thanks so much to Corey for taking care of all my empty containers and setting me up with some new, fresh makeup.  Appreciated all your help and the great customer service you gave to me."
1,"I recently reviewed the consistently very decent Apartment restaurant, however, on returning there for a meal this week for the first time in a wee while, I realised it had gone through somewhat of a refurb after ten years of faithfully serving up the famous Chunky Healthy Lines to Tollcross/Bruntsfield diners. The Apartment's sister restaurant, The Outsider, still includes these delicacies on the menu, so the newly made over Apartment now sports a different menu and a different look.\n\nThe understated, modern trendiness of the interior still remains, but new additions include an awesome array of different lights, which were both contemporary and edgy, plus raised ceilings and a mirror that kind of looked like it had a skyscraper design imprinted on it. Some might call it French vintage looking shabby chic, others might just want to sit and enjoy the food and not spend hours defining the decor. \n\nThe menu had quite a few traditional dishes with a modern twist. I went for the hake, served with an almond and capers dressing, while my friends went for the seafood chowder. All really tasty, and still good times all round, even without the skewers and beetroot coleslaw."
1,"If you want some Dicks in your mouth then this is the place.  Service is fun and awesome, food is great for pub food. Absolutely had an amazing time and I recommend to everyone. Anita was our server and she made the experience fun and enjoyable, and the best photobomb ever."
0,"This airport has not evolved or grown to accommodate its business. Similar to PHL; it is over capacity at each gate, does not have enough power outlets (let alone designated power stations), and lack of hot food choices in each terminal make is a dismal place for a layover.\n\nI personally feel awkward with bathroom attendants present as well. I prefer not to have an audience."
1,"Great option for dinner at the MGM.  Loved the ambiance and service was great, seemed like there was always someone there to fill your wine glass or ask if you needed something.  Had the seabass and it was amazing!"
0,Lots of empty tables ... 25-30 minute wait for brunch for two ... Must not be cool enough for this place.  Joyride ...  operated by the same company ... next door rocks.  Can't figure that out.
0,"It had been a lot of years and I was thinking, you know, some questionable cow and fake horseradish sauce might just hit the spot.\n\nTheir signature roast beef sandwitch comes in 3 sizes: small, medium, and something approaching the size of your head. \n\nI think my meal had enough salt in it to pay a Roman legion with, but since the legions today are paid in Federal Reserve fiat greenbacks, the salt goes to Arby's. Maybe I'll try it again after I time travel into the future a few years."
1,"I really need to try more of the menu. \n\nSo far I've had the cocktails (yummy and strong), the anti-pasta plate and the hummas.  Everything has been fantastic.. the anti-pasta plate was solid, really great to order for an appetizer or just to snack on if you are going there for cocktails.\n\nI will be going back again to explore more of the menu."
0,"I could go on and on and on, but let's just cut to the chase: this place is horrible.  I don't think you could pay me to imagine a less-enjoyable dining experience.\n\nEven though half the tables were empty, we were asked to wait at the bar.  Not a bad idea, who minds a drink before dinner?  Well, when you think \""bar,\"" think the breakfast bar at you grandma's condo.  Maybe one or two extra tacky, awkward-backed bar stools.  I couldn't count 10 bottles of liquor, and I think they went into the kitchen to get my beer (eventually).\n\nService?  It didn't exist.  We literally had to grab them (physically) when it was time to take our order (ok, time had come and gone, but we grabbed them eventually).  Forget about water, more bread, etc.\n\nI think my favorite part of the meal was the all-out yelling match the owner got into with a customer.  I believe he used the \""F-\"" word when conveying his disappointment with the fact that they'd been waiting over an hour for their food.  OK, so you leave that language outside, but everyone in the restaurant was feeling his pain.  And I never think it's okay to argue with a customer, but this woman was more than arguing - she was making a point for the entire dining room to hear.\n\nThe food?  Overpriced and way underwhelming.  I paid about $17 for what was essentially a plate of spaghetti, butter, and some zucchini.  No flavor, no pizzaz.  I was entertained enough by overloading it with the pepper I found on the table, pretending it was a garnish.\n\nSo the meal sucked, the service sucked, the ambiance missed the opening of this place.  The good news is the owner gave us a business card, wrote 20% off on it, and said she was sorry for yelling and we should come back.  I'm an honest person, but I took this opportunity to lie and tell her we would."
1,"LOVE! This store is fantastic, the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, they keep a good stock of items, and the store is organized and clean.\n\nNote. VEGETARIANS: the only place in town I can get vegetarian turkey slices (tofurkey I guess?) but its delicious!!!"
0,"Okay - yes the burger was good.  Here is the rest of the review.\n\nThis is a fast food joint with restaurant prices!  It was $24 for 2 burgers, 2 fries and a 2 drinks.  I don't like fast food joints that do not offer a combo deal.  You know we are coming in there for a burger and fries so make it easy on us!\n\nAlso, I ordered a cheese burger and I got a double cheese burger.  Why are we forced into a double burger?  One regular patty would have been just fine.  \n\nAs for all the toppings - I guess some people like that... but I am a hamburger purist; all those toppings just make a mess of the hamburger.\n\nThen the fries - $2.89 for fries.  You do get a very large portion, probably enough for 3 people!  I do not care for the fries.  I like some crunch to my fries.  These were very soft russet potato fries.  I would say they may even be fresh cut, but still not impressed.  I guess some people like them soft and limp.  I had the cajun fries - nothing special just some soft greasy fries with some cajun seasoning... \n\nIf I do not like the fries - I ain't going there.  \n\nIn most of my reviews (BTW - this is #100) I factor in VALUE.  5 Guys sells a hamburger, fries and a coke for $12!!!!  The hamburger was good but... I am not going back.\n\nSorry - 5 guys."
0,"Though this place is just filthy dirty, that's not the reason for the poor review. The employees here just suck. They don't smile, don't even acknowledge you when you say hi; and the worst part is they sit there on the cell phone in front of you. I had a cashier snarl wait at me so he could finish his HEATED conversation on his phone. Dropped my 44 oz drink on the counter and told him where he could stick his cell phone. Will not go back."
0,Not to swank of a place but they do have good food for cheap prices. In hendertucky off water street there is not much to choose from food wise. The rainbow club  is kind of lack luster but it will do if you're on a tight budget. Check out the menu because each day of the week has a special. Because of the low prices you do have to wait a while.
1,"if only i wasnt so hungover, i would've enjoyed my visit here much more.\n\ni didnt let our wonderful waiter go through his recommendations (i normally do at restaurants) and ordered my smoked salmon platter. girlfriend got the corned beef hash, and another got the croque madame. we also ordered extra pommes frittes. the smoked salmon was just so-so unfortunately, i think i wanted heavy and greasy food to cure my hangover. the pommes frittes were delicious, and so was my friend's croque madame, and i dont even like ham!\n\nlater as i felt better, i asked the waiter what he would have recommended, and he said the chicken and waffles and some other salmon dish. they sounded so good, and my friend went back the next month and said they were amazing! will have to try it again next time...NOT hungover."
1,I LOVE their bundt cakes. They made all our cakes nice and tasty. They were so fresh too! Definitely recommend them for special occasions or just for gifts to co-workers!
0,"I was really excited to try another new place in Vegas. The reviews were great and I love Bachi Burger. The food was really good but 5 hours later I got really sick. I had the corned beef hash and a cup of coffee.  It's too bad because the food was really good. Now the thought of the hash makes me cringe.  I called the manager just to let them know. She said she would do some \""researching\"" and call me back. She didn't. No worries though. I didn't want to call but my boyfriend insisted they know.  My friend had the pancakes and said they were good. She was fine.\n\nPROS: Creative corned beef hash recipe \n             Kona blend coffee\n\nCONS: Eating something there that got me really sick all night."
0,"Staff is friendly but doesn't know plants. Education @ cashier probably equivalent grocery clerk. (they were the ones who 'showed' me the peace lily. \n\nI purchased the peace lily and repotted at home. Odd, now that I've bought a few peace lilies...none of Summerwinds were blooming.... I think odd.\n\nI wanted a flowering plant for house; depend of nursery to sell correct plant.\n\nThe plant I purchased (over-priced compared to Lowes) is NOT a peace lily. It's thriving; however, different from peace lilies I subsequently purchased at more reliable stores. \nIt is some quiescient type of green foliage. Maybe kindasorta has the peace lily stem; however, I expect the nursery ladies to sell exactly what I wanted. They must not know a peace lily from another, nonflowering, leafy green plant or lettuce. \n\nSince I tried Lowes in Tempe, I think I found much better nursery. Prices are much better and plants labeled accurately....Baker is always good; however, quite a drive.\n\nI would return this plant; however, I live too far south to make the drive. Never go back."
0,"Please don't use them. Completely unprofessional. They will take application fees after they have already approved an application.  I looked on the mls my real estate agent sent and they had taken the house off the market not even an hour after we had paid them an app. Fee then after she told my agent the house was already rented to someone, I called her to ask her why we weren't approved. Because of her poor English she thought I was trying to put in a new application for the house she had already taken off the market!and was telling me to drop of the cash. People like these are the reason why people don't trust foreigners.  I thank God we didn't get approved, completely unproffessional, and dishonest business"
0,Everytime I go into this Sally's I feel discriminated against. I just went in there and a girl was staring right next me and didn't offer assistance. And it didn't help that she was so nice to other customers in front of me. I was very disappointment today.
0,"You get what you pay for with Fox. We reserved a Chrysler 300 for a long road trip from Phoenix to Park City, UT. When we went to pick up the car, they said they didn't have any cars in a luxury size. It took 45 minutes for them to give us a Nissan Altima at a 15% discount. The guys behind the counter seemed to be lost and confused the entire time. \n\nThe car smelled strongly of smoke. And once we got on the road, it sounded like a wheel bearing was going out. We had to get on the phone and see when and where we could exchange the car the next morning since it didn't seem smart to take the car on a long road trip. They did provide a Jeep Liberty once we took the Altima back the next day and gave us the Altima price, which somewhat redeemed the terrible service of the previous day. \n\nFox was definitely a hassle, but a lot cheaper than the competition. You can take a gamble and save some money, but you may have some issues along the way."
0,"Wouldn't come again. The food is so so... The service is good, but the taste is not there. Potato chips are overwhelmed with the blue cheese and the Asian salad with chicken just not there."
1,Amazing food! Authentic real Mexican food! Definitely worth the drive to Summerlin. The staff was very friendly I love that it's family owned they definitely care more than the chain places. My margarita on the rocks was amazing I didn't order top shelf and you don't have to there very smooth and they're definitely not stingy w the alcohol . A must try for Mexican food I had a guacamole burrito enchilada style and their homemade noodle soup w cheese. So good!! I'll definitely keep going back.
0,We went for the unlimited sushi but ended up waiting around for way too long for our food. Just a truly ridiculous amount of time. I felt like the sushi was below average as well. Wouldn't come back.
1,"A welcome addition to a neighborhood in need of better taco offerings.  Will carve out a nice niche, better than America's but not quite as pricey and crowded as Barrio Queen.  The salsa bar makes highlights the best chips in the area and their seafood offerings are among the best on the menu."
1,"Yummy, yummy in my tummy!  On a weekday lunch trip with my girls, Dion L., Katie M. & Simone M., Katie & I decided to try out Local Loaf.\n\nIt was such a hard choice, because I love me some sandwiches. AND, I love the Local  Loaf - get it, LOCAL ;) - has local ingredients. After much thinking, I went with The Local Dip & cucumber salad as a side.\n\nI didn't have to wait too long for the food, maybe less than 10 minutes. While I love the presentation of the food on the wooden plank, it made for a bit of a mess every time I went to dip my sandwich in the delicious au jus. The steak was cooked nicely & it was very tender. The baguette bread...mmmm! Not too hard & not too soft, it was just right! You could taste how fresh it was. The cucumber salad was cool & refreshing, with onion & dill. \n\nThe employees here are very friendly. Adam, the owner, was extremely nice & you can tell how proud he is of his shop. \n\nPrices are reasonable & they use \""Square\"" for debit/credit card payments."
0,Very rude and the girl that did my hair cut gave me the feeling like she had better thing to do. I will not be back
1,"I'm learning to use my sewing machine and wanted some fabric to practice on.....this place is rather overwhelming to a total newbie, as there are reams and reams of fabric in all shades and styles.  Even though I know less than nothing about sewing, I had fun looking at all the pretty textiles; I can see how one can get sucked into the home arts.  Prices are pretty reasonable: regular price fabrics are $7-15/yard while the clearance fabrics are somewhere between $3-6/yard.  (The bolts of fabric here measure 54\"", if that means anything to those with sewing knowledge.)\n\nI spent about $15 (including tax) for fabric to make a tablecloth.  The saleslady wasn't the most personable, but maybe it was an off day...."
0,"Another AYCE sushi place. I went here a year ago and remember it being better. The service was still good, they're fast and constantly checked on us. Here's a breakdown of the sushi we ate:\n\nVolcano - too much mayo tasting.  \n\nDragon - rice a little slushy. Eel sauce is good. Average everything else  \n\nBoulder crunch - could only really taste the avocado and the eel sauce. Would not recommend \n\nAre you ready - it really is spicy. And I can handle a good amount. That said, it's an ok roll. Can't really taste the roll through all the spicyness. \n\nLasagna - too mushy. Couldn't really taste the flavors\n\nHamachi (yellowtail) - tasty. Texture was alright.\n\nAlbacore (bincho) - a little salty. Texture was off. Would not order\n\nHalibut (hirame) - texture was terrible. Not a fan"
0,"I finally decided to write a review even though I have been coming to Grabba Green for a while now. The food is decent if you're looking for a healthy alternate from all the fast food places around here. I would love to give them more stars but their service is horrendous and slow. Horrendous because every time I go, I felt unwelcome. I believe in good customer service especially when your client is paying a ridiculous price for stuff they can make at home themselves. A smile would also be nice instead of having a f**k face all the time. Especially the red headed step-child dude. Maybe you should find another job because apparently customer service isn't your forte. Maybe it's just towards me because they seem to smile and seem helpful towards other people. I'd rather make my own salad and juice then ever come back to this establishment. \n\nLike I said if you like healthy stuff then do try this place out but don't expect a cheery staff to greet you that enjoys their job or act like they actually enjoy their job and don't expect fast service also."
0,"For starters, appointments are meaningless.  I understand some delay in seeing a vet - emergencies happen - but the half-dozen times we brought dogs here, we had appointments every time except for one, and they were always at least a half-hour late in seeing us.  More if you count the time when the appointment \""started\"" because we would wait in the exam room for another 10-15 minutes before the doctor came in.  \n\nTo make matters worse, the people who worked the desk were completely unapologetic and downright rude most of those times, too.\n\nI put up with it because we liked the vet we usually saw there, and while the prices seemed high they were also comparable with other Phoenix vets, I guess (how weighing a dog qualifies for an \""exam fee\"" I'll never understand).  The final straw came when one of our dogs cut his paw fairly badly.\n\nRight off the bat, they charged us $60 to inform us that he had been cut (Thanks, doc!)  They wanted to charge us $650 to sedate him and stitch the cut.  They refused to offer any other alternative.  By the time they saw us, the wound had stopped bleeding, and he barely flinched when touched.  Total time they spent with him: 10 minutes.\n\nI was outraged, because I knew glue - or at most staples - would do the trick.  I went to another vet and was completely right.  A few days later the wound was completely healed without the use of sedatives and for many hundreds cheaper.\n\n(I hate feeling like a cheap skate when it comes to my dog's health, but in this instance I knew I was right - stitches and sedatives were completely over-the-top.  It would be like a doctor prescribing LASIK when all you need is a pair of reading glasses - it would fix the problem but wouldn't be at all necessary.)\n\nTo make matters even worse, I thought we'd settled up at the desk of the office.  Turns out not, and without getting a phone call from the office, they turned our account over to collections.  Over 60 lousy bucks that they didn't even earn in the first place - we'd been taking our dogs there for more than a year and they couldn't take the time to call us first."
1,"I am awaiting my license and went in to get some supplies and the woman behind the counter was friendly as she always is. She actually showed me how to go online and check to see if I passed my tests, which I didn't know how to do and told me what to do once I do receive my license in the mail. After realizing I'd forgot something I needed to go back later on and another woman helped me look for another product. I have found that the people at Armstrong are always helpful and willing to help."
0,"Donald S. just reminded me I had not reviewed the Village Tavern yet.\n\nEat at your own risk, I can only tell you my experience and you do with it what you like. \n\nI la la la loved the food here, used to dine in regularly and happy hour often until. \n\nDun dun dun dun, one evening my girlfriends and I rendezvous at the Tavern for a little happy hour. It was not happy and we left in well under an hour. Just after being sat in the bar area we saw the biggest freakin rat. It would have made NY proud! \n\nWe packed it in and disappeared into the night never to return. :( Sad tale for a place I loved so much. It's like breaking up with someone you still have feelings for but you know it's the right thing to do."
1,"Been here a couple of times and have neglected to review until now (thanks, daily rehearsals!!).  Both visits resulted in happy tummies, assisted by friendly and helpful waitstaff.  All dishes sampled were tasty and flavourful without being greasy.  On my last visit, I enjoyed the huevos and chorizo (scrambled eggs and sausage) immensely -- spicy, filling, and yummy.  Portions are generous and the chips and salsa appetizer (gratis) help to stave hunger pangs while waiting for your meal.  The salsa could be a little bit spicier, but it tasted fresh and tomato-y.  \n\nThe decor has an intimate feel to it: dim lighting and understated wall art (nothing gaudy or over-the-top).  I would enjoy a dinner here on a date night.  :)"
0,"** WORST EXPERIENCE EVER... like E-V-E-R !\n\nWent to a little Mexican eatery at Caesars Palace.  My husband almost ate a rusty industrial staple, that was in his black beans.  My husband bit into it and his face dropped when he pulled it out and identified it as a large industrial staple.  I quickly went and spoke to an employee of the eatery- telling them what was found.  They told me to wait at the table for the proper people to arrive (to record the incident).  My husband wanted to leave right then and go to the ER to get a tetanus shot.  I was upset/shocked and wanted to speak to someone... 45 MINUTES LATER... I start really looking around.. and noticing something strange.  There are three men around us... sitting at tables alone.. AND THEN I REALIZE THEY ARE FILMING US!!!!!!!!!!!!!  THEY ACTUALLY were sitting there for the past- who knows how long FILMING US with their camera phones.....  I WAS SOOOOOOOOOOO ANGRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I said to one of the men YOU GET ME SOMEONE NOW!!  All three men scattered like cockroaches.  Within 2 mins someone was there to take a report.  I said why were there men video taping us for the last 45 mins?!?!  The man said he didn't know- it was part of security...  What a terrible experience.  Horrible.. Ruined our trip.. left the next day since my husband was sure he was going to get some infection from the rusty staple.. he promptly got his tetanus shot."
0,"Service was slow, food was not well-cooked, and the prices were too high for the food we received and ambiance we experienced. The wait staff was pleasant and the menu was promising, but everything just felt disorganized and not quite put-together. I feel that maybe in a few months they'll have their \""stuff\"" together a little better, but as of today I feel they charged far too much for the experience they were offering."
1,"Yeah, um, are there any other hotels in Vegas? Cuz I won't need to know.  We're going to be staying here as long as our little dollars can afford it.  \n\nAmazing rooms, decorated to the nines. Contemporary, luxurious and fun for the techno geek - you can control the entire room from your tv - temperature, lighting, sound...\n\nGreat bars - Chandelier bar - so fun! Hidden pizza gem (back alley pizza).  Great club - Marquis (select nights, hotel guests get in free).  \n\n3 wonderful pools and a really relaxing spa.  Totally well located on the strip between the Bellagio and City Center.\n\nI can't say enough about how much we love this hotel.  My only unanswered question is: When can we go back??"
0,"Bianca did my pedicure and unfortunately it was the worst pedicure that I've ever had. She didn't trim my cuticles at all or remove the dead skin around my toes. I got the callus removal, and she barely scrubbed my feet. I always get dry feet during winter, and after this pedicure my feet still aren't summer ready. Highly disappointed. Not at all worth the $32 I paid. The staff is very friendly, and the prices would be reasonable if it was quality work."
1,"I'd give this show even more stars if I could!!! They alternate between spectacular physical feats and raunchy over the top humor. Occasionally they combine the two. One second we were getting misty eyed watching a love-themed aerial ballet, the next we were laughing so hard we thought we were going to fall out of our chairs. Do not come to this show if you don't have a sense of humor!!! We were warned about the folding chairs but didn't even notice because the show was so great and the people squeezed into the seats surrounding us were very cool. This is a must-see!"
0,"There are only two reasons I usually go to Gourmet House of Hong Kong--I need cheap, fast Chinese Food that's not packaged in a panda logo and I want a place where actual Chinese  people are behind the counter. The food isn't bad. It's what you'd expect in a Cantonese style place. But whatever I order seems boring and uninspired. Last time I had chicken and vegetables (really weren't many veggies) and a side of fried rice. I was disappointed that it was just white rice with bits of egg. I thought there would at least be some onion or scallion. And the rice still tasted more steamed than fried. I think they are playing loosely with the definition of fried rice. Anyway, I was glad last year that they fixed up the decor. The peeling paint on the outside did not do much to whet the appetite."
0,"My best friend and I decided we wanted sushi so we went to Little Buddha at the Palms.  The food is good but the service is terrible.  It took us about 2 hours to order our food, get it, eat it, and pay our bill.  Our plan was to go out for the night but that was busted because we were so tired when we left this place since we were there for so damn long.  The sushi wraps are very good, but it doesn't take 45 minutes to make sushi wraps.  The california rolls were good.  The angry chicken was okay...could have been better.  The coffee creme brulee was AMAZING. Overall, it is pricey, the food is okay, but the wait time is just sad.  If you don't mind wasting your time for overpriced and okay food then go here."
1,"I have driven past Blue Fin many times and never realizing it.  We finally, after hearing great things, decided to give it a try.  So, we met a couple of friends for dinner and grabbed a table.  I like the feel of Blue Fin as you walk in.  We were in the first section, not near the bar.  So, we didn't have the bar experience, which I have grown accustomed to.  But, the service was quick and friendly.  I like the menu a lot, and was able to get out of my comfort zone a bit.  I am still a sushi rookie, but I kind of know what I am looking for in a good roll.\n\nThe first thing we ordered was the poke.  I had a couple of pieces but, it's not my thing.  Everyone else at the table loved it.  Anyhow, we started to order rolls after rolls.  Now, I don't know the names, but know that they were good.  Screaming O's, spicy tuna, and a roll that I will probably crave for a while now, that had guacamole.  It seemed every roll came out looking amazing and tasting even better.  \n\nWe also had an interesting experience, and no fault at all to Blue Fin, a customer must have had a little too much Sake and was puking her guts up in the bathroom.  But, as soon as she was finished the staff went in quickly to clean up and sanitize everything.\n\nSo, I'm sure we will definitely be back.  Great location, prices, sushi and service."
1,"I have really enjoyed my classes at Blue Sky for the most part.  (I also did their yoga hike once, but not sure if they do those anymore.  Lovely idea in concept, but lots of sand in mouth in reality.)  \n\nEveryone else has already talked about the things that make it so great (donation-based, intimate classes, good vibe), which it is, so I will be the Debbie Downer and list a few of my small quibbles: \n\nThe studio is quite small, and the instructors do not limit the class size, as they are walk-in classes.  So sometimes it will be awesome with 4 people and almost like a private class, but if you try and cram 13 people in there.... it's hot as hell (positive, if you like bikram I guess!) and so crowded you can barely move for fear you'll kick the art right off the walls.   Also, it's right on Charleston Ave, so there can be a lot of street noise.  Sadly, my beloved instructor Michelle is leaving. Sniff! She was probably my fave teacher ever, and I've had a lot!\n\nBut that's it.  Otherwise, awesome, awesome, awesome."
0,"I'm a Carrabba's guy, everywhere I go in the US.  This experience wasn't  the  best, I always order the chicken Marsala this time it didn't look the same (not a lot of sauce and mushrooms as I'm used to and the chicken was very thin) I thought  that all the restaurants would be the same. The service was very good though.  I expected more though.  This experience would not keep me from going back to my local Carrabbas"
0,The concept is good but the finished product is a mess.  \n\nLagasse's Stadium is a cross between Philippe Stark and a dive bar.  Go figure.\n\nSeveral televisions on several different sports stations conflicting with what the next person wants to watch.  Little crazy for those who go specifically to see a certain game at a $25.00 minimum.  Wouldn't be brave enough to order food but the beer is cold.
1,"Food: Got two rolls, and some fried calamari. The fish was fresh and the calamari was actually really delicious. My only gripe with the food was that the sushi had way too much rice. I was totally full after one roll. \n\nService: Service was good. Nothing to write home about or to complain about\n\nPrice: Really good prices. I live in California, and there's no way you could find this quality of sushi for that good a price. \n\nI'd go back."
1,"Excellent dining experience which started with the hostesses, bubbly smile and welcoming personality. Heard many reviews about the bread basket, come on its bread. Now I eat those words. Several choices, sour dough roll, kalamata olive, pretzel (my fav) and others. I had seared ahi tuna. Generous portion cooked to perfection with wasabi and pickled ginger. My date had the pan saut\u00e9ed scallops. She loved them and my taste was wonderful. She also had the lobster bisque. It was so rich and creamy.  For sides we had mushrooms, saut\u00e9ed with garlic we loved them. Also had creamed spinach. We both thought it was fine, have had better. Both portions were very generous, more than enough for both of us. Service was fantastic."
0,"I've been looking all over the valley for a wedding dress, evening gown, or bridesmaid dress. I'm getting married this October. I prefer not to wear white, therefore, I've been trying on burgundy and/or apple red evening gowns and bridesmaid dresses. It's been extremely difficult to find a dress anywhere in the valley with any kind of sleeve. Stores will advertise beautiful dresses with a sleeve, then you call, and no one ever has them in stock. This store advertises themselves to be the \""sleeve specialist\"". They show you a video on their website and explain how they carry all sorts of wedding and formal gowns with sleeves. The tutorial by the owner goes on to explain how when she got married, she could not find a dress with sleeves and decided to open her own store. I thought this was going to be the place for me being this store is suppose to specialize in dresses with sleeves. NOT! I drove from Peoria to Mesa to find my dress here. In this entire store, in the bridal section, in a size range of 3 sizes, there were 2 total dresses with sleeves. In the formal gowns / party dresses / bridesmaid, there were a total of 4 dresses with sleeves and they were ugly. I was really let down. You can not advertise yourself to be a store that specializes in dresses with sleeves and not have any. A huge waste of my drive. They had a very small section of bridesmaid/evening gowns. Not worth the drive at all for those kinds of dresses. I dislike false advertising and felt very mislead by their website."
0,"I probably go here every 6 mos. or so if I'm with a meat eater that is and they have to have In N Out the grilled cheese is consistently good and my kid likes em too, along with the fries that sometimes come w/ a fish taste at no extra charge!! Chocolate shakes are always fun though and most everyone I go with regrets eating the burgers afterwards though they say \""Dude that was a good call you had a grilled cheese huhuhuhuuuh I dont feel too great.\"" I'm not big on onions so the animal style stuff doesnt do it for me either sorry folks. \n\nI remember when In N Out came to town GOOD WORD you couldnt even get into the damn place they would have cones up in the parking lot with cops directing traffic. I think its way overrated but they pay the kids that work here more than minimum wage and well the meat eaters need to eat still right!?!"

After being told by friends this place was good, we had a Caprese salad which is not very appetizing and then a four seasons Pizza where it was clear that all of the vegetables came out of cans and had virtually no flavor . It was almost no mozzarella cheese on the pizza and the tomatoes were watery and unripe. All in all very disappointing."
0,"We figured it was a lovely afternoon to conduct some business on the patio at Twin Peaks in Scottsdale.  Good service by our waitress, passable appetizers but it all came with a shock.  Our waitress, Janell (??) was very helpful but approached our table about an hour later and said they're instituting a cover charge and that she could \""...go ahead an add $15 to our check for a party of three.\""\n\nPersonally, I was shocked as our tab was already north of $80 (and climbing) and we hadn't even ordered our meal. \n\nI ask to speak to the manager and about ten minutes later he arrives to say that it's \""corporate policy\"" and that they always do that when there's an event.  Plus, there was \""now a sign that we can go look at that mentions a $5 cover\"", which wasn't at the door at our arrival time.\n\nSo it was basically, \""We'll add $15 to your bill or you can leave\"".\n\nI talked about how this is  neighborhood bar, our bill was almost $100 already before we even ordered an entree and it wasn't clear that there was a \""special event\"" taking place, our hostess mentioned nothing, there was no sign (at the time) and our waitress was just as surprised as we were about the requirement to add an additional $15 to our bill.\n\nI was told that I was free to leave and read the sign that is now in front of the door.\n\nThe manager insisted that we pay an additional $15 or vacate.  \n\nWe decided to wrap up business, leave the bar and went elsewhere for dinner.\n\nThe manager decides to end our evening without an opportunity to order an entree, closes our check and makes it clear that our business isn't welcome.\n\nTwin Peaks has a great bar and a great patio during the afternoon, but the indifference of their manager completely turned me off from returning.  Visiting during the afternoon to conduct some business on the deck, never.\n\nThis was a piss-poor experience and sadly, the manager doesn't care."
0,"I've been to many clubs in Tijuana...and this place is trashier than most of them. And just like the trashy clubs in TJ, it attracts trashy people. Don't know why you'd be in Vegas and want to pay a $10 cover for a trashy place like this when you can go to much better clubs for just a little bit more, heck you can get into many for the same price with the comps you can get. \n\nBeing an afterhours club is the only thing it has going for it but it's not even good at that, it closes at 5. If you want a good afterhours club go to Drai's which parties all the way past the sunrise."
1,I love this place.  I am very picky about my nature nails and over the past year I have enjoyed the way James does my nails.  Fantastic service at this place. The staff is like family. My feet are smooth and pretty everytime Christy is done. I can show them to the world.   Carmalita also does my massages and I feel like a new woman when she's done.  No more aches and pains.  This place is the BEST!
1,Like always the food is great. Can not finish the burrito. Super stuff. Staff is friendly. Chips and queso are just so darn good. Must get the word out that this place is 1000x better than their competitors.  Been here both day and night. I must say I love eating here this is my cheat day food. Fresh press tortillas are awsome.
0,Probably the worst service I've experienced in Arizona .. Pretty bad I sent my food back .. There are far better service and food in the same area !!!
0,"CAUTION!!!!!!! Take a picture of your signed receipts here! Waiters/Waitresses like to over charge your card with a larger tip.... I know this because it happened to me unfortunately. Management was very unapologetic and made it seem like it was my fault that I didn't give the waitress a 30% tip...hmmm. I am still waiting for the management to return the excess money to my card. I guess that's what happens when little restaurants flourish. They get MONEY HUNGRY!! I doubt my little yelp review will damage the business in any way, but I feel like I would be doing a disservice not to warn my fellow consumer. Word to the wise...check your bank statements after visiting here...you might end up with an extra expense for GREED!"

Great talent, never an empty glass, most needs anticipated with ease."
1,"I love this place. Even someone who isn't a Boston sports fan should like this place. Here's why:\n\nYes, they serve stiff drinks for low prices. Yes, they have Boston sports memorabilia. Yes, they are a dive bar. These are all givens.\n\nWhat do they do that sets them apart you ask?\n\nToday I participated in a holiday toy drive. You bring in a toy for less fortunate kids and you get a free drink. I can't think of anything more awesome for the holiday season. I didn't even really want the drink. I just was happy to have the opportunity to help someone in need.\n\nAlso, they play Sons of Anarchy every Tuesday night. I can't think of any other bar that does this, and I totally dig it.\n\nPoint in case, this bar is different. They do typical bar things, but also go above and beyond for their customers and community.\n\nThis is by far my favorite bar, ever, and I've been to quite a few. And I will put my money on the fact that you will love it too."
0,"The atmosphere here is fun.  Gawdy in a good way. Very Vegas.  The food portions are humongous.  We went for breakfast before we hit the road to go back home.  I ordered pancakes.  The waitress advised a short stack because she said they're kind of big.  She wasn't kidding.  The 2 pancakes overflowed the big plate!  That said- the actual quality of the food was left something to be desired.  The huge pancakes tasted a little cardboardy.  In addition the service wasn't so friendly- maybe it was too early in the moring.   Maybe we'll give it a second chance when we go back to vegas.  The people who went late night or for dinner in the fireside lounge seemed to have a better experience.  But with so many options in Vegas, not sure it's worth it to give them a second chance."
0,"pros... an okay hotel in vegas.  good location, you can get to most other places pretty easily, when traffic permits.  right across the street from game works and the big m & m store as well.  our suite was big, clean, nicely furnished and the bed was very comfortable.  all you would expect from a hotel of this price range.   \n\nthe only other good thing was the front desk clerk.  our csr was named phoung and she helped us out very quickly and was very cheerful as well.  \n\ncons... the hotel is showing it's age.  went here when it had first opened, and it was so much more of a vegas hotel.  now it's luster has gone and it is just another hotel that just happens to be on the las vegas strip, nothing special.  it's not super bad but for the price it's not really worth it either. \n\nthe other thing which was missing was a good place to eat, like a restaurant on the ground floor or something.  i didn't much expect to see just a sign saying, \""buffet\"" and \""diner\"" or something to that effect.  the food was edible but nothing special.  the one other good thing is that you can get a 2 for 1 deal on the breakfast.  \n\nthe elevators were in horrible shape.  doors all banged up and scratched, it's not so much the appearance of the doors, yeah they are elevator doors, but they didn't even close right.  if you happen to be nice and hold the door open for a straggler, the alarm would sound, and then the doors would slowly, noisily, screech their way close.  one door had a large gouge taken out of it, and was severely dented.  not once in the 4 days that i was there, did i see anyone cleaning or wiping down the elevators.  in other hotels along the strip they have whole battalions of people cleaning, dusting, moping, sweeping, and polishing anything that wasn't human.  that was not the case at this hotel. \n\nas for the rest of the casino, it was typical las vegas, confusing carpet patterns, every where you look, looks exactly the same so you get lost inside the casino.  the lights are perpetually muted so you don't know what time it is.  the heavy oppressive smell of smoke, you don't see the smoke but you can really smell it.  \n\nt.v. here sucked.  my buddy's room had a poltergeist t.v. which turned on in the middle of the night and would turn off, remote would change channels and volume but wouldn't turn it off, and even the button on the actual set wouldn't turn it off.  oh and our room didn't even have the \""do not disturb\"" door tag, or any note paper as well.    \n\nall in all a pretty disappointing hotel to stay at.  i would expect this type of hotel off the strip, nothing fancy about the front, nothing eye catching, nothing to say, \""hey look at me and come in for a good time\"".\nin fact, this hotel should be moved out somewhere off the strip.  it's like a second class hotel charging first class prices.  not a good place.  i would rather stay next door at new york, new york then here."
0,"I REALLY wanted to love this place...but it did not go well.  I never noticed this restaurant although it is right next door to my favorite burrito spot (Super Burrito).  When I arrived they were plenty of people pulling into the drive thru.  Since I couldn't figure out what to order, I went inside.  The staff was cordial.  I decided to keep it simple and ordered a traditional burrito.  I was so excited!  I got home and bit into it and \""crunch\""!  I tried again..more crunch!  Broken egg shells in my burrito!   Needless to say I lost my appetite.  I called to let them know I was bringing the burrito back and no I didn't want anything else (they offered).  Although they were very apologetic, I'm just not sure I can bring myself back to trying something else.  D'lish was a D'isappointment :(  Maybe I'll give the new Tempe location a try *sigh*."

1,"Been back to Vegas quite a few times and always make a point to stop by this restaurant. This place is here to provide CLEAN eating to people who follow healthy lifestyles. There isn't table service- you order your food, grab a number, and pick up your food when it is ready. I have had the thai monster bowl, sexy bitch bowl, and the steak burrito and thoroughly enjoyed ALL. Loved adding sriracha to everything as well. If you want clean eats, eat here. Last visit 11/20/14."
1,"Solid buffet. All your usual Chinese favs. I particularly liked the Sushi (they have alot of different kinds) and their baked seafood dish. This was lunch so no crab, etc. Their honey chicken was also really good, not covered in batter and sort of light. The service is also really good, they clean plates and re-fill drinks right like ninjas (so stealth you wonder was it aliens who did it)."
1,"My first Michael Mina.\n\nAfter learning that we would have to wait almost 2 hours for craftsteak, my friends and I decided to eat at Michael Mina's Seablue.  I am so glad we did!  It was, quite possibly, one of the best dining experiences of my life.\n\nThe four of us started with an oyster each.  Two of us had Kumamotos and the other two had Raspberry Points.  They were so fresh and delicious!  It was a great beginning for what the rest of the meal would taste like.  The \""bread\"" for the table was actually naan.  It came with a trio of dips - hummus, roasted eggplant, and a creamy cheese.  Our two appetizers were tasting trios.  The steamed trio came with mussles, clams and prawns.  The raw trio came with yellowtail, salmon and tuna.  OMG!  It was so so so good!  We used the naan to sop up the juices produced from our steamed trio.  We ate so much of it that we even asked for more naan, which they brought out with more dip.  Seriously, we knew we were going to hurt from all that food, yet somehow, we couldn't stop ourselves.\n\nBy the time our entrees came out, we were stuffed.  Still, we knew the culinary experience was not one to be passed up so we ate on.  We ordered the Seablue \""paella\"" (it was a tad salty on the bottom), the scallops, and the 16 oz bone-in NY steak.  The food was excellent!  As much as we wanted to finish everything on the table (hey, we knew it was costing a pretty penny), we couldn't stuff our over-stuffed selves.  So, it broke my heart but we left some food on the table because we wanted dessert.  Damn those people who sat next to us, because we probably wouldn't have ordered more food were it not for us seeing their lovely order of desserts.  Being troopers, we rallied each other and ordered what they had - the white chocolate napoleon and the molten chocolate cake.  I've never been a big fan of napoleons but that was the best dessert I've had in a really long time - and I'm a fan of desserts!\n\nOur waiter, bless him, never judged our need to overindulge.  He was professional and efficient and the service was 4 star.  As sometimes happens with fancy places, I am so glad that bad service is not something this place has to worry about.\n\nThis was the best meal I have had this year.\nYay (fellow Marin resident) Michael Mina!!"
1,"This place is a great place to escape from reality for a few days. The RV campground is very large and has a number of amenities, which makes your stay pleasant. It has a close proximity to the Strip.\n\nUnfortunately, the spaces are tight in between units and it is located next to an Interstate. Even with this, we slept soundly in the RV campground. The security at the front gate was a positive even though the RV was in a good neighborhood.\n\nThe pool, laundry facilities, bathroom were all well maintained and clean.\n\nWould I recommend this park? Absolutely. Would we come back? Absolutely.\n\nInformational: We travel in a 36' Class A RV."
0,"Horrible birthday experience! They called an hour before to confirm the reservation and left a message saying they would cancel if the call was not returned, I sat on hold for 10 minutes while waiting to confirm reservations. We were never told the entire party had to arrive before being seated nor that individuals would not be allowed to enter the restaurant after 9:30pm without having their name on a \""list\"". Once seated the waiter got the drink order mixed up several times and told several members in our party that what they ordered for their meal was \""horrible\"" and requested that we pick another item off the menu. After selecting a forth item off the menu I was disappointed in what I received. I will never spend a dime here again."
0,I am only reviewing the sushi. We waited more than thirty minutes for food. They were somewhat busy however we were hardly acknowledged. The rice on the sushi was too sticky and the rolls were warm. It was a bit humid from the Korean BBQ grills. I won't be back.
1,"The only thing I can say against the place is that they need better signage to direct the tourists from Waverley Station. Or if they have a kiosk located in the station, it needs to be better posted.\n\nOnce you find the place, expect to be extremely pleased. Courteous service from a clerk who probably deals with tourists like me (unlikely they can be even more clueless than me) all day but was patient in explaining the day ticket deal (\u00a33 all day) and how the tickets work (just scratch off today's date and go) and providing me with a map of the bus routes. Five minutes later, I was at the bus stop. And five minutes later than that, I was taking a front row seat in the double-decker that brought me to the hotel.\n\nThe day pass is probably the best method if you're planning on riding at least three buses in a day, otherwise you can pay on board. Exact change only. Or if you're in Edinburgh for more than a few days, consider one of the weekly/monthly/annual passes.\n\nYes, they accept credit cards. Even the swipe and sign ones we Americans carry. And yes, they spoke English that was clear enough for me, a Yank, to understand. :)"
0,"Assistance may do wonderful things for the community, but their Thrift store is not a great place to shop for bargains.\n\nThe Good: The store is well organized and clean. Its easy to look through the merchandise and the store has amble parking and easy to find. Very little furniture and some bric-a-brac\n\nThe Bad: The merchandise is overpriced. Shoes are $10-15. Better brands go higher. They really separate merch by brands and price accordingly. If you are looking for a deal on anything designer, then be prepared to pay. I dont have an issue with this, since they have to make money, but $20 for a men's dress shirt? And some of the stuff they price \""designer\"" is not (Kenneth Cole, Calvin Klein, Reaction and RL) I see this stuff all over Goodwill and Salvation Army priced for much much less. I'd be willing to buy some of the stuff I saw, but not at the price they were marked. I saw lots of pretty nice designer stuff priced between $50-100. Maybe a deal to some, but I kept wishing if I saw this stuff at Savers or Goodwill, so it would be a lot less. \n\nThe Ugly: The woman I encountered behind the counter was rude. I asked if there are any specials and she clearly shot me a stink eye. \nI thought: Hey Lady! News flash: All other thrift stores have daily specials. If your lame ass thrift store doesn't, its ok, just say so. No need to take offensive.\nShe finally said \""Everything is special here\"" with an attitude.\nI stared at her and said \""Of course it is. You are special too\"" and walked off.\n\nIn short, I would not go out of my way to shop here. If in the area and you have never stopped by, you were bored and wanted to spend more then you should, then buy all means stop by."
0,"Ooh.  Um... THE SUCK...\n\nThe few of us who somehow woke before noon walked about the Miracle Mile shops in search of some breakfast eats.  Unfortunately, we stumbled upon this joint and had too little mental acuity to give it a once over before deciding...\n\nThe decor and theme would be perfect if it were an outdoor restaurant, not so much under a faux sky in a darkened corner of a mall.\n\nService was responsive, though that probably had a lot to do with us being only the second party in the establishment.  Our server did comp me a grapefruit juice when it turned out that they weren't out...\n\nBut the menu.  Ech.  Not a one (of the four of us) were happy with our meals.  Yes, its primarily a seafood and wine bar, but REALLY?  How do you screw up AND be chintzy on breakfasts and salads?  I dare say, I've had better for cheaper at Denny's..."
0,OK I'm giving the Venetian 2 stars because the service was a -2 \nthe crowd was a -1 \nand the room was a 5\nThis is not a 3 or 4 star place\n\nlet me explain Vegas if its your 1st time \nthere are 2 types of people in Vegas \n1) 80ish grandma sitting in front of the penny slot \n2a) 21 year old Dbag partying throwing up everywhere \n2b)those who want to still be 21 dbags \n\nyou will see a lot of 2a and 2b crowd in the Venetian; so to me the jersey shore crowd at the venetian is a little annoying
0,"I have been an advocate of Banker Insulation since 2007 when they did some insulation work for my Garage in Surprise. Did a great job and couldn't be happier. In 2011, they did it again to our home in Goodyear. Great job again. Decided to use them at our business location in Goodyear, why wouldn't we. The actual job of removing the old insulation and installing the new looks great. But prior to the insulation job, we had the epoxy floors done so keeping them nice was critical. The sales manager suggested some boots for the lift so that the lift didn't cause issues with the floor. Sounds great to me. After the job was done, the floors were scraped and scratched and it did not look like either of the lifts had any boots on them. I do not know how they got scraped up, whether is what the lifts supports, staples on the floors and turning on them, I really don't care what did it. I just wanted them to be exactly how they were. Come to find out, that boots/diapers are for the bottom of the lifts, not for the tires, so that the lifts do not leak oil on the floors. That was not made known until after we were trying to come to problem solving answer. My $10,000+ epoxy floors don't look like $10,000+ floors any longer. They would rather say that it was not their fault when no one else is in the shop while they are working then keep a continued customer happy. $750 out of a $6000+ invoice, It is really sad. Am I an advocate now? I can't. If they come back and offer to fix the floor, I would say that they did the right thing and would become an advocate for them again."
0,"Our pizza was good with premium toppings, and I loved the bar glassware and tap choices, but holy cow they shaft you with high prices.  I know it's supposed to be gourmet and everything but come on, come on, it is only pizza."
1,"I must be honest, I was hesitant at first to try this place. I can't pronounce the name, I was sure that it was a glorified Panera. However, a friend of mine asked me to meet him there, so I obliged. \n\nWhen I first walked in, I loved the eclectic style that was everywhere with the mismatched furniture that all just effortlessly \""went\"" together. The place was packed and so was the pastry display case. My mouth was watering as soon as I walked in. The sweet and savory smells that waft throughout the entire venue are irresistable. I had the portabella and leek soup with a hot chocolate. Incredible! The goat cheese gave it an extra layer of flavor that just made the soup so perfect and the hot chocolate was real chocolate with steamed milk. It is the kind of food you crave when you are looking for comfort after a bad day.\n\nSince that first experience, I do try to go back as often as I can. The salted caramel brownies are amazing and they even have the recipe online for people to try. This establishment really shows what true craftsmanship and quality should be like within the food industry and I always feel like their number one customer!"
1,"Amazing burgers, had once would go again except the wait was pretty long."
0,"I have been to sumomaya twice before and have really enjoyed the experience. I loved the food and they have my favorite drink in town. Tonight however for the first time I walked out of a restaurant. After no one, but the person who poured out water (his name was Seth and he was so nice!), came to our table for 15 minutes we left. The table right next to us was being waited on and despite being walked by at least 8 times total by 3 different people not one person acknowledged our table. Best part was on the way out the hostess who greeted us asked how the food was....because 15 minutes is the usual table turnover time. Really upset about this one and honestly unless they fix their wait staff problems I don't think I will comeback or recommend them :("
1,"Went here last November and was really suprised at quality of food , service was quick and server was very attentive even though we had kids on tow. Special offers on food at certain times of the day , never seems to be packed but does get busy before and after theatre events next door to Omni centre at the Playhouse. Kids are more than welcome as well which is good as it's a really nice place to take them for a meal."
1,"The restaurant itself is in a cool building. The bar is upstairs and they make a great mixed drink with Brazilian sugar cane rum. The salad bar was ok. People go on and on about the salad bar, but honestly it was ok. The waldorf and caesar salads were improperly seasoned, definitely needed more flavor, but the cheeses were delicious. Of course, the main attraction is the meat. The meat was great, and cooked perfectly. I highly recommend saving room for the bacon wrapped fillet. I went to Chima during restaurant week, and I would say it is well worth the $30, but I don't know that I would pay regular price for it. Although the food is delicious, this is not a great date restaurant. You will constantly be bombarded by men in short pants wanting to serve you new cuts of meat."

0,"yogis is to sushi/japanese as panda express is to chinese.\n\ni have been in here twice. the first time the service was alright, and the food was lackluster. the rolls were small and looked nothing like the ones plastered all over the wall. they were served in a styrofoam box. the second time i went in the food was even worse. the girls in the back were chatting while i waited up front for about 2 minutes to order. she was extremely unpleasant. it took them about 5 minutes to make my simple teryaki bowl which was filled with little, thin, fatty strips of dark meat and topped with [yuck] green onions. the sauce was alright. not even siracha could help this bowl.\n\ndisgusting."

1,"Come early so you can see the \""lay of the land\"" before it gets super crowded. I really like the outside terrace area. If you time it right you can see the volcano erupting. \n\nCame on a Thursday night with 3 other girls, didn't pay cover since a promoter found us that day at our pool and invited us. Received a couple of free drinks too from him. Drinks are the usual, $13 average for a vodka drink. Dancing was a lot of fun but like everyone says it gets so crowded so you wont have much space of your own. I was drunk so I didn't care much. \n\nI never had a wait for the bathrooms upstairs with the crazy doors but you know I could have just skipped the line for all I know, a lot of people stand up there to watch the scene below. \n\nI hope to go back on my next trip."
0,"Expensive here, why?  Food takes a long time too, even when you're the only patron in the place.  Feels like a sketchy area too.  More Chicago-themed than many other Gyro places in this part of town."
0,The food is usually very good however the service is terrible. You need to plan at least an hour for any meal.
1,"this place is yummy!  I've been craving a lobster roll ever since moving west from the east coast and the lobster roll here is delicious!\n\nTheir lobster mac n cheese is also VERY good. Their cajun garlic fries are soooo good and just the right amount of crispy.  Relatively expensive, but then again, it's Vegas and it's lobster."
1,"After reading Wheat Belly and having blood work come back pre diabetic, my husband and I decided to banish the original GMO food from our diet for 6 months to see if it effects our blood work and health.\nThe thought of never having bread and pizza and desert again had both of us a little bummed.  I have been searching for alternatives.  This is the very best alternative I can think of.  In the summer the last thing I want to do is heat up the house with an experiment that might not work.\nAll of their breads and treats have been delicious so far.  We ate a whole loaf of cheese flatbread after the first visit.  On Saturdays they discount 6 packs to sell out inventory before days they are closed.  They make special orders and sell their flour and breadcrumbs!  \nMy husband loved the Pina Colada cake, the muffins(Blueberry and Lemon poppyseed} were delicious.  Yes their frosting is outstanding.  Real ingredients in small batches is indeed evident.  I ordered a baguette and can make and enjoy fresh bruschetta, a summertime favorite with real bread!\nHours are funky so check before you go.  Worth every effort."
1,Great Chinese Food!
0,"My group of friends came across this place while we were searching for a late night bar/grill to eat at. We all didn't really expect much, and the menu sounded pretty good, so we decided to drink and eat here.\n\nThe service here was VERY slow. After getting seated, our waitress came and got our orders about 15-20 minutes after. There weren't that many people there, so there was no reason for slow service. After ordering, we had to wait another 20-30 minutes to get food. We decided to order a round of drinks while we waited. This also took quite a while, and she also forgot one of our drinks. \n\nThe food here is not that great. Their tacos are extremely plain and shitty tacos that look like leftovers. However, the nachos looked amazing, so there are some things that are good (you just have to do some research). \n\nOverall, a terrible experience. The wait is long, the food is bad, and the food price is ridiculous for what you get. The only upside is that it's open somewhat late, and the drinks are pretty cheap."
1,"I  love this place for what it is!  Cheesy decor, good late night eats, drinks  and friendly service, and for me memories of trips to Vegas as a child where this was our breakfast spot before heading back to CA.  Our party of six arrived at about 11 on a Saturday night and were quickly seated.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict and while they weren't the most amazing version of Eggs Benedict I ever had they were tasty and with three eggs and hash browns included more then enough for one person.  I would highly recommend the Key Lime Pie Martini.  Delicious and tasted just like the desert with a graham cracker crust  rim.  A photographer came by and offered to take \""free\"" pictures of our group with no obligation.  Of course to upgrade to a nice full size photo without the Peppermill logos all over turned into $10 but it was a nice memento of the evening and easily scanned and divided among six of us!"
0,"What the heck happened to Blu Basil?? I haven't been in a few months, don't miss the TVs but you walk in and there is a weird case of ? ice cream or gelato I guess? No music, the bar is gone, the fireplace is gone. I about fell on my face walking to the bathroom b/c the floor is buckling. The service was super slow despite there being only two other tables. 92.5 sanitation rating. My husband's beer was rancid. Our food was fine but the atmosphere was really weird and off. Really sad to see one of our old neighborhood faves clearly heading for the graveyard."
0,I went to this location in hopes to get my new IPhone to another carrier. They guy told me he could do it told me it will be done in 4hrs at 7pm. I drove 25 miles 1 way and he tells me sorry I couldnt get to it. I asked for a refund and he said no Ill have it ready tomorrow at 10am. This being TODAY! I just got back after having to drive yet another 50 miles round trip to and from this worthless place. They did not fix it they didnt even attempt to fix it. The firmware had not been changed NOTHING. He gave me my $ back but over all very unpleased. The Hispanic guy looked stoned and the the Middle eastern guy was completly clueless. I completly felt as if they were trying to steal my phone. They had misplaced it and acted like they didnt know where it was. i said Im calling the police they magically found it 2 seconds later. This place is absolutly not worth going to please Consumer BEWARE!!!!
1,"This was my first time to Del Frisco's. My Boss said he had been to one in Chicago but never in Vegas so we took out our customers for a great steak dinner.\n\nWhen you walk in its very fancy and since it's the Double Eagle \""golf term\"" they give away golf picks which is cool if you like golf stuff.\n\nWe made a reservation via opentable for 8 people and it worked perfectly we were seated near that back there restaurant in a banquet room at this larger beautiful round table. Gorgeous place setting and decorations.\n\nOur waitress name was Carly I think I can't remember but I feel sorry for her because the group of guys we had at our table were crazy. We all were getting a little bit too rowdy for this type of place.  It was funny but a little nuts. Luckily she was really cool and hooked us up with great advice and our orders came out super quick. So that's a plus.\n\nWe all started off with beer and wine and I had Jack on the rocks. Then we ordered Shrimp Remoulade and Crab Cakes. The shrimps were delicious because of that the wonderful heavenly sauce they had on them. The Crab cakes were also very good because of a lobster sauce that came with it. Then we ordered some Onion Rings Beer Battered, Thick Cut. These things were massive. It was the biggest onion rings I have ever seen/eaten. I really liked the onions flavor they were perfect and the crust outside was perfect as well.\n\nThen we moved on too the main course except I can't remember what everyone ordered but I think my Boss ordered the Filet Mignon 12 oz. and 3 other guys ordered that as well. They said it was cooked perfectly and it was very tender and delicious. I always say let me be the judge. I know a good steak when i eat one. I love steak.\n\nSo I was looking over the menu and nothing wowed me. I asked our waitress if they had any off menu mega steaks and she said yes we have the Tomahawk Cut 32oz Rib eye long bone. I said hmm that sounds good. So i ordered it medium rare. It was $90.00  It came out pretty quick and I was feeling pretty hungry so i started to dig in. It was cooked just right which was nice. I like it bloody and still wiggling (gross I know)  It was seared perfectly and tasted good but it really needed more spices. I don't know if they just salt and peppered the steak or if they put a rub on it but it was bland in my opinion. It really needed some garlic or rosemary,thyme, oregano, paprika or something. I finished the steak in 20 minutes and I was still hungry.\nI was a little disappointed on the size of the steak seem smaller then 2lbs.\n\nThen for desert our customer recommend we all have a round of Limoncello which i have never had before and most likely never will again. In my opinion they are way to sweet. Almost choking sweetness. I mean if you like lemon flavor you would like this but it's not good to take as a shot all in one. \n\nOverall our customer said the dinner was great and my Boss really enjoyed the night so I would say we most likely would recommend and or come back next year for our Sema Dinner event.\n\nThanks Del Frisco's for the awesome memories!"
0,"Just went there for breakfast. It was a complete disaster. \n\nWe waited in line for 5 minutes for the hostess to take our name and then waited 15 minutes after that to be seated. This was a little frustrating since we could see there were open tables. \n\nOnce we were sat on the patio, the waitress took our drink order and didn't come back to take our food order for about 15 minutes. She seemed annoyed and indifferent.\n\nWe waited FOREVER for our food. People around us were clearly as displeased as we were. The waitress never came over to refill our drinks or offer any explanation for the wait. It was almost as if she was avoiding us. We just sat and waited, getting more annoyed every minute. We watched as tables of customers sat with no food and the staff milled around, no pep in their step, no sense of urgency. They all seemed like they really could not care less about their jobs and their tips. \n\nWhen we finally got our food it was nothing impressive. We basically got an $8 slice of bread with some ham and cheese on it. Nothing anyone couldn't make at home. Never got a refill on our drinks. Food was edible but I wouldn't call it \""good\"". \n\nThe waitress explained, after I asked why it took so long that 3 people in the kitchen had walked out so that's why she was frustrated. SHE WAS FRUSTRATED? I couldn't believe she had the nerve to say that when she wasn't doing anything to make up for it. I would respect them if they looked like they were trying but they really weren't. \n\nThere was no sign of a manager or owner. It looked like a bunch of sloppy, apathetic kids with no guidance working there. If your kitchen staff walked out that's a clear indication of a problem. \n\nIt's too bad because the ambiance is cute and hip, and this area could really use a privately owned spot for breakfast, but all in all, I would say DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY on this poorly managed joint. We won't be back."
1,I have a furniture store here in Vegas and used Paul's Signs. Very happy with the job they did for me. From the beginning they were very upfront and honest. They were able to beat everyone else's price and finish the job when they said they would. I will work with these people (Paul) as well as recommend them to any friend.
1,"After living in New York for a few years, I became a bit of a deli snob. One rachel and matzoh ball soup order later, and I was reassured that Pgh can hold its own in the deli scene! This is definitely our go-to place for grabbing a quick meal, or when we are craving a sammy. The food is very reasonably priced, and the staff is quite friendly. Also, a bonus is that they have bottled beer available for you to sip on with your meal."
1,"I had breakfast again at Raffles for the second time in 2010 this November while on vacation from the Hawaii.  I ordered the Norwegian Benedict and totally enjoyed my breakfast.  The staff seemed to be worn out and zombie-like; maybe due to the 120,000 auto after-market convention people and three battalions of Marines in town for the weekend.\n\nThis time at Raffles; food 4 stars / staff 3 stars."
1,"I have been coming to Max Allegheny Tavern since I was still in my mother's womb.  But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:\n\nBrunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.\n\nAppetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.\n\nMeals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I also don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.\n\nSides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!\n\nDessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.\n\nBesides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet."
1,"one of the BEST pulled pork sammies EVAH.  the lil pig will do since the big pig was quite piggy.  won't even talk about the mac daddy.\n\nexactly what you'd expect from a down home bbq place.  with real bikers & everythin.  note the rules:\nno cigars, no colors, no patches\n\nfirst time there so we covered off on some key sides:\nhush puppies - not too heavy, tasty corn goodness\nmac & cheese - nice crusty top\ngreen bean casserole - fried onion thingies on top were mushed in.  otherwise felt a tad bit healthier\ndeviled eggs - lucifer would be proud\ncollards greens - a bit salty but still good\nwings - they came plain but i think it's bc we ordered them that way.  nice sauces...like the mustard best.  teriyaki rice rocket was a little sweet and i'm too weak to have fully drenched the bird in the hot version."
0,"After picking up my bib packet for Saturday mornings 9/11 Remembrance Run 9./11 K race I am running, the lady & decided to grab some mid afternoon lunch. Being in the eclectic people watching mecca of the west (also known as Fremont Street in Las Vegas) we settled on checking out the newly remodeled Plaza Hotel, and our first foray into the quirky \""Hash House a Go Go\"" which just opened recently.\n\nAfter getting welcomed and seated we both decided to feast on this big, bad sandwich:\n\n\""INDIANA FAVORITES\n\nBig O'crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin sandwich\nWith onion, pickles & of course ketchup on a whole wheat bun served with your choice of side. You'll think you're back in Indiana!\""\n\nSo when Tommy our server came to take the order, we rolled with it.\n\nExcept I made a fatal food service customer error.\n\nI asked if I could have some *lettuce* added to the above.\n\nSee, as a former Hoosier, I grew up with pork tenderloin sandwiches. The staple of VFW Post lunches, greasy all night diners, and fairs & festivals. Except, as the HH description notes, it is not served with the 'traditional' IN combination of lettuce, tomato, and mayo. Understanding this, I figured I would compromise, and make just a minor deviation.\n\n\""Can I get lettuce added to mine also please?\"", I asked.\n\n*pause*\n\nTommy: \""you want lettuce on yours also. Uh, well, I can add it, except it would come as a side, so it will come as a \""side item\"", and its an additional upcharge for $2.00. Did you want me to do that?\""\n\nMe: (silence while mentally calculating how two leafs of iceberg lettuce retails out to $2.00 in food service). \""Um, no that's okay, I can't justify that\"".\n\nGood thing I didn't ask for tomato and/or mayo then.\n\nThe meal came out and as described, the hammered tenderloin was HUGE. Mind you, this is how it is depicted.\n\nMine appeared a bit differently: Less fanfare in the presentation. Which was still okay. With no pickle. The thing is HUGE. And wasn't too bad taste wise.\n\nTommy was a great server. Brought a refill of drink out before less than 1/4 remaining- always a gold standard. Pronounced my last name on debit card spot on, which can be difficult. \n\nTommy also said \""I checked with the manager about the lettuce and she said that they could not do it without charging extra... which I don't agree with personally\"".\n\nSo all in all, this particular server is on top of his game. The food was decent, yet not remarkable. And my bill for the sandwiches, soda, lemonade and the fries? A staggering $39.00 for lunch with no adult beverages.\n\nThat's right. Kind of a pricey lunch for what you get, however I guess the portion size makes up for it.\n\nWith that said, the fact that you cannot make a simple addition like iceberg lettuce is the reason I will not go back to HH in Las Vegas. I can buy an entire head of lettuce for about 99 cents. I understand restaurants making profit, and certainly addition or substitutions can cost more. 50 cents extra? no problem, I guess. I come from an area where tomato is a seasonal item and can actually cost more off season (i.e. 'deluxe' on a burger). I guess for the same price I should have ordered the hamburger which comes 'deluxe' instead.\n\nMy point to the review/rant is that customers in restaurants often do need to make substitutions or changes out of dietary concerns, and I get that. However the server discussing it with the manager and her standing firm on that kind of a request for such a simple item is a bit out of line. I can get lettuce on by $1.29 BK double cheeseburger for nothing, because it is an inexpensive item. An upscale restaurant needs to have *some* flexibility to its policy on adding \""vegetables\"" as a side item. Had I ordered a \""side of lettuce\"", then I would expect to be charged more for it because that is known as a salad. I should have asked to trade for the pickle I never got on the sandwich instead and called it even.\n\nI don't make a policy out of speaking to managers. The last time I did so (calmly and as we left) it led to a fight in the relationship, and I don't need that hassle either. So what is one to do?\n\nVote with my money.\n\nAnd that is why I will not be back to Hash House A Go Go."
0,"This was a splurge night choice of a restaurant. It won't be a slurge again, mainly because I don't think I'll be able to convince my husband to go again. \n\nWe went at 5:30pm last Saturday. This was the perfect time to go because there was no line yet. Turns out the line begins to form around 6:30ish. Anyway, I digress...\n\nMy experience: I had no problem finding things to try and eat. Nothing was really amazing or shouted out \""I want more!\"". The food was just okay, although there was this spinach/feta/mushroom salad that was good. The dessert selection looked good but only the mini cheesecake was really good. The gelato was too icey for gelato if that makes any sense and not really that good. Believe me- I know gelato after living in Italy for 3 years. All said- it was just okay. \n\nMy husband's experience:  \""Horrible & Never again\"" to use his words. Main reason for this complaint... my husband loves his shrimp cocktail. He had to wait in long lines to get to this shrimp (and other shell fish). It grossed him out because there would be people in line waiting as well, eating off their plates. Also, both times he went back to get refills on the shrimp, the shrimp itself was still too frozen to eat. \n\nHere is what's wrong with buffet...the stations are set up wrong. The main attraction for this restaurant is the shelled fish (shrimp, mussels, clams, crab legs). The locations (there are two) of these stations is not very convenient nor well set up for traffic flow. Long lines form because the stations are in cramped areas in between larger stations that most people skip anyway to go to the shelled fish. \n\nPeople end up waiting in the long lines for the shelled fish and in the end, might not be worth the wait. Imagine waiting 10 minutes in line only get finally get to the station and then having to wait another 5 minutes while they replenish the food. Also, just imagine other people standing in line, eating off their plates, while along side other food stations. Not very clean (nor good manners). \n\nSuggestion: make the bar smaller since most people drink either soda or water, move the meat station (which is really nothing more than roasted beef and sausage) to a smaller station. Move the shelled fish to the larger more open stations. \n\nThe good note: our \""server\"" was very attentive about refilling our drinks and clearing our basket as it filled with the shells."
1,"I love this place anytime I'm by UNLV and in the mood for sushi, ill hit this place up... Even better now is the place just got bigger so now there is no 1 to 2 hour wait... Still a little cramped in there but at least your not sanding outside for too long. The sushi is still good but I some times think their servers don't have assigned areas because I'm always asked did some take your drink over at least twice?? But I guess I'll take that over not being asked at all"
0,"I only write reviews for companies I feel passionate about. This is one. They SCAMMED everyone at EDC by failing to plan appropriately, simple enough. What happens when a few college kids think they're smart enough to run a company.\n\nWould not EVER recommend them, to ANYONE. DO NOT USE 1NS."
0,"Complete ripoff. 5 shots of vodka in a 50+ oz container of sugar water for 32 bucks. I actually only saw the bartender pour 4 shots, so not sure it was even the 5 they claim.  We tossed it out half way thru, it was so bad.  No kick, and sure as hell isn't going to get you NUMB.  Total false advertising.   If you want to be a winning product, need to make your drinks stronger.  They were so weak."
0,"The food was OK, it's breakfast you can't screw it up too much. Had the wonderful opportunity to experience Jennifer's service. I order dry wheat toast, gives it to me with butter...its a mistake. No big deal. I ask for toast without butter. 10 minutes later I get the toast. I'm done now! She was to busy helping sit another customer when there was already a hostess who's job was to seat people. After she seats them she goes in the back and runs her mouth some more and then finally realizes she forgot the toast. Jennifer, I was not upset about the mistake of the toast I was upset by your poor services I need the toast when I got my food not when I'm done."
1,"Ate at the Chef's table and had a wonderful experience.  Very impressive wait staff; top notch suggestions with both food and wine.  Interior is very modern and has a busy happy hour. \nStarted with the caesar salad; big for a starter salad. Anchovies gave it a nice fresh taste.  Had the short rib pappardelle with a bolognese sauce.  Fresh pecorino and rosemary and it was just perfect.  Everyone's plate looks amazing.  Osso Bucco was also a popular choice at the table and I had a taste of that. It was also very good.  \nI was stuffed after dinner so didnt' have a dessert but saw some leaving the kitchen; looked like I missed some good choices.  \nIt is a corporate crowd for sure but it we had great service, tasty food and it had a nice wine list as well."
1,"This is my second visit, both times the cashier and another guy (I think the owner) was there. They're very friendly and I asked the cashier a couple of questions regarding the milk teas and he answered it and help me made my choice! \n\nI ordered the iced milk tea with taro pudding and boba and it was yum! \n\nPrices are very reasonable and they're very generous with the boba and other toppings! \n\nI think it'd be a good idea if they start serving small snacks that goes with boba! I passed by japan creek market to get some sushi and takoyaki and it paired well with my boba. \n\nI would've bought it at qq boba if they serve something like that there too. :)\n\nThey have power bands on the side, so I purchased one too!\n\nAll in all, it was such a pleasant experience! I will definitely come back!"
1,"For a suburban breakfast spot, I am always surprised to find that we get seated right away at Crackers & Co.  You can't get near Black Bear Diner at the same time of day but you can walk right in to Crackers & Co.  It is really a testament to how quickly they churn out food and turn over tables.  \n\nEvery time I go I try something different.  While I've only been for breakfast, I am always satisfied with my order.  It comes quickly and tastes great.  While nothing compares to Matt's, this is as good as it gets for this kind of breakfast place.  I would take Crackers & Co over any of the competition any day."
1,"I absolutely love this place!  The views are gorgegous!  Food is awesome!  Service is 5 stars. The rooms are comfy, spacious, and bathrooms are outstanding.  How can you go wrong?  I guess by not booking a reservation!\n\nThe pools are peaceful with music and a cabana boy."
0,"While the waterfront atmosphere is nice and the service is very attentive, this restaurant is very overpriced and the menu is tiny. I went here because of a great review in my travel guide. If this restaurant had posted its menu on its website, I would not have gone. The food here is fine, but in a city with no shortage of great restaurants, why limit yourself to a tiny menu and subject yourself to high prices?"
0,"I'm giving it 2 stars because our server was really nice and attentive. His name is Corbin ( I think that's how you spell it ) if you go there he will take care of you.  The place was nice and I love the ambience , it was something we wanted to check out for Sunday football. When the host sat us at our table it was the only table that had food left over from the previous dinners. And not crumbs, chunks of food, baby puffs & sauce. It was gross. I looked around to see if it was a Roadhouse thing ( they let you crack nuts and leave the shells on the ground) or if was just a turn-over tables and hurry and seat the next customers. So we can look it over, it happens I guess . So we ordered the Knots app and a vegetarian pizza. The Knots were pretty pathetic and tasteless but if you dipped it in the sauce the flavor goes to holy sweet! Like pucker sweet. The pizza was good but the sauce was sweet on that too so I didn't enjoy it but my husband did. I'm pretty sad about or visit. We have been wanting to go for awhile."
0,"I love dancing! It's been a while since I've gone out and where I've been out in Arizona. My friend and I planned our annual Scottsdale dance night and this year the best night for us ended up on Wednesday. \n\nI could tell it had been a LONG time since I've done the club scene since most of my old stomping ground was either permanently closed, getting remodeled, or just closed on \""hump day.\"" Myst was the only club open in the Old Town Scottsdale area. When we got there, they told us that it was 18 and up on Wednesday nights and that people don't really show up until 11:30pm. It's also a $10 cover. Also, if you check your coat it's an additional $5. The 21 and older crowd can go upstairs and get drinks. \n\nThe dance floor is a pretty good size; however,  the music wasn't the best and seemed like the same thing over and over. I like current songs that you can occasionally sing along to and I think there was maybe one by Beyonce. \n\nThe crowd was young and many were all over each other. It made me embarrassed for some of the women there and then disappointed in the men for trying to handle women inappropriately. It is unusual for me to leave a club early and to not dance, but this was just not a good vibe or crowd. Whatever happened to dress nicely? Many of the guys just showed up in jeans and a flannel shirt. Seriously. The club looked warn and not kept up (e.g., holes in walls, could use a new paint job in the bathrooms, and not all the lights were on). \n\nDancing is fun, but not for me at Myst. Maybe it's the economy, but Myst has seen its better days and it's going to take a lot to get back to that."
1,"First saw Lee's when I was going to Scottsdale Pen a few doors down. I bookmarked it in my head and brought my two besties from out of town to try it. Lee was not only generous with the free samples, she was also patient enough to deal with three indecisive giggling girls. That's a plus in my book. \n\nThe flavor I tried was the Jack Daniel Chocolate Swirl and you can definitely taste the JD. I've have been back countless times and most of the time the flavors are really good. I have had so many I can't remember but some that I really liked are Alabama Slammer, French Coffee Tequila, and the Red Velvet with Scotch. (I loved the Red Velvet so much, I actually bought a 1/2 gallon of it.) The only flavor I was not fond of was the Banana Oreo w/ Bourbon. (But then again, I'm not too bananas about bananas.) \n\nPrices are not cheap. Two scoops ran me about $8 but it's a great little treat and the constant changing flavors always keeps me coming back. If you really like a flavor and it's not in rotation, Lee will make it for you if you order a 1/2 gallon or more. Just give her a day or two notice and she will have it packaged with dry ice waiting for you. \n\nParking can be difficult since there are tons of restaurants around but park a little farther, grab your ice cream to go and have a nice walk around the waterfront area. (It'll help burn off the calories.) And don't forget your punch card! Buy 8 scoops and you get one free!"
1,"First, it was that shit-show of a night: First Friday. Where all of suburbia exclaims \""Oh, we do have things going on in Phoenix!\"" Moira was slammed, servers filling and refilling water cups of those who are too cheap to buy drinks, but want to take advantage of Happy Hour.\n\nStill, the staff was smiling. They hustled and I had 3 people ask if we'd been helped. When we were seated our sever was jovial, made light of the situation and suggested we order most of our items at once so that we'd get everything promptly. \n\nNow, while it wasn't the best sushi I'd ever had (it just wasn't). I am telling you, unequivocally, it was the servers that made my night. At the end of our meal we were approached by another server who made sure we'd had an enjoyable experience. She was extremely sincere and reminded us to come by on Thursdays where the wine is half priced, and the joint is half-filled! : )\n\nI don't know how ya'll do it, but you're fucking rockstars!\n\nFoodwise: \n\nSquid Salad: Generous portion\nCalamari: Delicious\n\nAvoid:\nWhite Blossom roll. I've had a baked scallop roll before. This one...tasted quite funky \n\n: /"
0,"Vert very bad value for money\n\n\nDifficult to find something to really say about this restaurant, the food is your typical Lebanese food, ranging from good to ok \n\nUnfortunately when we were there we could not order the hot plates and had to settle for cold and hot mezze \n\nHumous was pretty blend the rest was ok / good but not exceptional\n\nStrangely if you order Humous, babaganoush or other spreads you don t get bred with it. You have to order it and pay for it and they don t even have Lebanese bred and only nan \n\nThis is my main problem with this restaurant is that they are taking you for a ride: order cold mezze you have to pay for bred, order $17 hot mezze you get 4 small ones poorly presented with nothing special \n\nAll in all $70 for 2 no alcohol just tea for an average experience if not below average ... I let you judge but I m never coming back"
1,Mike was amazing !! Called him and within 30 we met at Starbucks and 10 minutes later my screen was fixed!! Great service great price!!!
1,"Having finally tried Spoon I was very happy with my experience there.  The service was possibly the best I've received in Pittsburgh.  When I made the reservation they asked if it it was a special occasion (it was) and our server commented on it.  Also what was refreshing was that when my wife asked for a glass of wine recommendation without having the menu in front of us our waitress didn't bring her the most expensive glass on the menu.  They also automatically split the appetizer we were sharing onto two plates without us asking.   Overall the service was top notch. \n\nThe food was also outstanding.  We were thrilled with our appetizer, and both our dinners.  The bread basket they bring out was also amazing.  \n\nOverall I was thrilled with our dinner there and the dining experience."
0,"I used to like going to Delux but NOT anymore. About 6 months ago, I picked up a couple of salads and a burger to split with my then pregnant wife. She was a few bites in on the chicken salad and bit down on a 1\"" long aluminum rivet. She was okay thankfully. Having spent a number of years cooking in restaurants, I understand that equipment gets used pretty hard and things can and do break. So, not wanting to make too much of the issue, I politely called Delux and asked to speak with a manager. The manager got on the phone with me and I advised her what had happened. She didn't ask if my wife was okay-nothing. She asked for my phone number and advised that she would give it to the general manager and have him contact me. Well, to this day no one EVER followed up with me!\nFast forward to last Friday night. My wife wanted a chicken salad and fries so I decided to go to Delux since it is just a couple blocks from my office. I call and am placed on hold for about 5 minutes. I hung up and called a second time and this time waited for almost 10 minutes. I called back one last time before giving up and I get one of the counter girls who takes to-go orders. I start to place my order and \""click\"" she hangs up on me!!! I'm steaming at this point!! Then, I hear the counter girls voice again and she is laughing and talking to someone in the background and says, \""man, is that dude going to be pissed!\"" and then proceeds to hang up the phone!!\nSo, I decide that I am going to walk in and talk to the manager and let him know what just happened. It turns out that he is no better!! I explained what happened and my frustration with the situation and he just looked at me with a blank stare like, \""what do you want me to do about it?\""\nIts amazing that a place which used to be so good and deliver great customer service has turned to just another local disaster!! If you're wise, you'll avoid these guys like the plague!!"
0,"This is the first Cheesecake Factory in Pittsburgh. This location is in South Side Works. The service used to be so good when it first opened but now it's horrible! Most of the servers are spoiled college kids with snobby attitudes. \n\nPlus it's hard to find a parking space. They do offer valet parking and will validate your parking ticket for up to two hours if your parked in one of the surrounding garages\n\nEven though this is the larger of the two locations there is allways a wait. \n\nThe portions are large enough to share. The food is always good and hot and there's something for everyone. \n\nSome of my favorite appetizers are the Roadside Sliders, Southern Fried Chicken Sliders and the Firecracker Salmon. \n\nMy favorite specialties are the Ranch House Burger, Steak Diane and the Grilled Shrimp & Bacon Club. \n\nMy favorite cheesecake is the Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake. It is absolutely amazing!  \n\nMy favorite drinks are the Tropical Smoothie and the Frozen Iced Mango.\n\nThey don't offer a kid's menu. But they do offer a complementary baby plate that consists of bananas, oranges and bread."
1,"Went for the first time today and had a great experience. Very friendly staff welcomed us and the place is very clean.  \n\nThe seats are leather and have a swivel \""table/tray\"" attached if you choose to eat lunch or dinner there, which we did.  They have a pretty large menu offering the typical appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, salads and typical movie treats and...WAIT FOR IT....BEER and ALCOHOL!  The nice thing is, you never have to leave your seat, just push the button on your tray, and a very friendly server appears! \n\nI had a burger and beer today (Tuesdays are $2 off burgers and beer).  The burger and fries were tasty and the beer was cold!  I believe they do have other daily specials like $2 off Margaritas on Mondays.  \n\nCan't wait to go there again...the movie ticke prices are very affordable and prices for food are comparable to any other restaurant."
0,"I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.  It is in a terrible location, the staff is not friendly, and the rooms were semi-clean.  We wanted to save $ by not staying directly down-town... next time I will pay the extra $$!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I've passed by this place so many times. But I'm so happy to know that it's close by!\n\nI went in today, I was so starved, glad that the place was dead. (I knew I'd get my food right away.)\nI ordered the Carne Asada burrito, three rolled tacos with Guac and cheese, and a large cup of Horchata.\n\nThe rolled tacos were alright. But they slapped on a mountain of guac on top of it, that I overlooked their boringness and enjoyed every bite. (I love guac. D: SO MUCH. Avocados FTW!!!)\n\nI didn't realize how big the carne asada burrito was until I ate almost 2/3rds of it. I almost died, over stuffing myself because it was good, really good. I've had Carne plenty other places before, but this ghetto looking hole in the wall restaurant probably takes the #1 spot for yummiest Carne Asada.\n\nThe horchata was... Well, horchata! Very refreshing and helped balance out the flavor of the Carne asada burrito.\n\nThe service was good, and quick!\n\nDefinitely going back, probably tomorrow or something. Gonna try out the rest of their menu. I'll come back with an update when I've tried half their menu."
0,"Not a good vegan experience.  We were meeting friends at Casbah for dinner -their choice.  Since I follow a version of vegan, I called ahead and was assured that they had vegan versions of a couple of pasta dishes.  Server was very cooperative and said she would instruct the kitchen to omit the meat and  increase the veggies on their cavatelli.   Well, they omitted the meat, but I was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that I have ever seen.  At about $20, it was close to the price of caviar!"
1,"Great place to come for lunch with friends. The salads are large enough for two people and they don't mind splitting them if you ask. Get the tropical unsweetened iced tea instead of the regular!!\n\nPROS:\nTropical Iced Tea\nGreek Salad\nBaba Ganoush\nParmesan Crusted Artichokes\nHummus\nFig, caramelized onions & gorgonzola flatbread (Amazing!)\nStrawberry & watermelon salad\nProsciutto & artichoke pizza\n\nCONS:\nChicken Lettuce Cups - to much sauce and too much of a smokey flavor for my taste.\nTapas - priced on the high side."
1,"There seem to be a lot of misperceptions about places like Chipotle. For example, I know people who turn their noses up at eating at places like this because they are not \""authentic\"" Mexican restaurants...but ironically these same people will eat at Taco Bell (REALLY!!!  As if THAT is authentic Mexican??!!!) \n\nSo, yeah, let's just say upfront that Chipotle is not posing as a \""true\""  Mexican Restaruant - they are a TexMex-style chain specializing in stuff like burritos that happens to be based out of  Colorado. \n\nI also don't understand people who compare this place to Taco Bell... I think that people need to understand that places like this are more in the category of \""fast casual\"" versus true \""fast food\"" places.  Fast casual places are a tiny step above the fast-food chains, but a step below a full service restaurant. \n\nThey do not have drive-throughs but they are also not full service sit-down restaurants with waiter service. Basically, in a fast casual, you will go up to the counter and place your order.  They will put together your order as you go down the line so that you can select the various options & toppings.  Then, they give you a cup and you serve yourself with beverages and that sort of thing.  In some fast casual chains, they will bring your food to you after it's prepared. Also, in some of the places, they will bus the tables after you have eaten, but in others, you will clean up the table yourself when you are finished. Some examples of  other \""fast casual\""  TexMex chains include Qdoba, Salaritas, and Moe's. \n\nSo now that we understand the concept behind this restaurant, how does it stack up to it's competition?  In my opinion, it is much better than Qdoba, Salsaritas, and Moes. The pricing is generally in the same ballpark - and so are the portion sizes. However, I prefer Chipotle in terms of quality in part because they serve hormone-free naturally raised chicken.  But also, for me the freshness of the other ingredients has always been good.... the lettuce is fresh, the cheese does not have a \""plastic\"" texture.   And for my visits, I have found the employees to be friendly, fast, and efficient. \n \nIf you want super-fast, super-cheap food and don't mind highly-processed food packed with all sorts of nasty chemicals & preservatives (not to mention the \""mystery meat\"" which is actually a disgusting mixture of by-products and  who-knows-what), by all means, please stick with Taco Hell.  But for me,  I'll happily shell out a couple of dollars more to eat at Chipotle!"
1,"We ordered  the calamari as an appetizer and we were surprised because it was actually pretty good.  It had a mix of octopus and squid which was great.  The garlic rolls we're very greasy but they tasted good.  I had the bruschetta pizza and it was delicious. We also had the baked ravioli which was just ok, nothing special about it. I would definitely order the pizza again and even the calamari but not the ravioli. The restaurant is right at the center of the strip which makes it convenient to get to wherever you are.  Ohhh, and we got 20% off just for checking in on Yelp!"
1,"I live here, and all the servers are great.  I'm here 1-3 times a week, the Spring rolls are to dir for and the Pho is fantastic loaded with noodles and Veggies, great way to get a hot an healthy meal.  The place is always packed for lunch, so come early or for a late lunch.  My favorite is the #35 Spicy Beef Vermicelli, I only can handle the 3 out of 5 on the heat scale."
0,"Very unimpressive. Not good enough for the price. Get a carls $6 burger, it's worth $6. Bobby charges $10 for a $2 version of mcdonalds with frills."
1,"Bellagio hotel is one of the nicest hotels in Vegas. I have stayed here a few times, and my most recent stay was last week. The staff continue to be very attentive and wonderful. Reserving a lakeview room or a one or two bedroom suite that overlooks the lake is a plus! The pools are dreamy and gorgeous, and you do need to get out there pretty early on the weekends to get a lounge chair. \n\nThe hotel also has a wonderful art gallery (Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art), a great selection of restaurants (Circo, Fix, Yellowtail, etc) and wonderful shopping. Their show \""O\"" is pretty amazing also- that is a must see! \n\nIt's just a very classy, upscale place and one of the best places to stay at!"
0,"I think we might have had way too high of expectations for this place. I liked how nothing had nasty mayo all in it, but the selection was very minimal and they didn't give me an option for my side so I was stuck with potato chips. The lady was super friendly and the food was okay, but nothing more than I would expect to pick up at the grocery cafe store on my lunch break. Probably won't be back here even though the prices are good. But I'd honestly be happier with Subway."
0,"I have been to Fuchsia four times, all for facial treatments (no massage). The first time was a few years ago, and my treatment was pretty standard. I decided they were too far away from my home and left it at that.\n\nBut recently I decided to try microdermo and did some research. Not only was Fuchsia's price one of the most reasonable in town, they used the diamond system, so I decided to return.\n\nFirst visit - HEAVY sell on the membership even before my treatment, which I understand and expect but it gets really old. My treatment goes well, although I am a little upset they do zero extractions during a microdermo facial, apparently. Heavy sell again on the membership again when I checkout. I opt to buy a special 3 treatments for $150 card. 15 minutes later I get a phone call asking if I can return to the store. They apparently gave me the wrong card. I tell them I am already two far away. I was slightly shocked they would ask me to return to correct their mistake. Oh well. \n\nSecond visit - The air conditioner is not working. IN JULY. It's not horrible, but it is unpleasant enough that they opt to keep the door open while I get my treatment, which I find slightly strange and not very relaxing. I wish they had called me and asked to re-schedule. When I check out this time I receive the big sell on products. Again, I expect this, but it's still annoying. The products I am shown are very expensive ($65 mask, for example) and I politely decline. No samples are offered. I leave feeling and looking like I have a sunburn and still look that way the next day. I figure it must be working and this is normal. \n\nThird visit - Explain the sunburn feeling from the second visit and am told this is normal because they have \""gone up\"" on my microdermo handle/wand/tool thing. At checkout another sell on the membership because now I am out of treatments on the card I had purchased. I tell them I will think about. I then got a sell on product, but this time they offered samples. I happily take my product sample and the membership brochure and am on my merry way. However, now I am worried that my treatment was either bad the 1st and 3rd time, or bad the 2nd time, because I do not feel or look sunburned. So which time(s) did I get ripped off?\n\nThe front office ladies (possibly also the owners?) are very friendly and nice and seem to know members names, etc. However, they are always a bit disorganized (making appointments over the phone is always a little taxing) and heavy on sell of memberships, extra treatments, products, sparkly things they sell in the store. And frankly, I don't blame them. They want to make money! \n\nBottom line - I don't think my treatments were consistent and they are too far away from me, so I am not sure I will return. If you are interested in a membership (at least 12 months) and you find a good person there who you can trust, it's probably a great deal. I, however, will probably continue my search."
1,"I am so very picky when it comes to cakes. The cake is always what I look forward to for Birthdays, Weddings, Holidays- actually any day I can find an excuse to get a cake for, I will. \nWhen I discovered Simply Sweets I knew I finally discovered a bakery that the cakes not only look amazing, but they taste every bit as good as they look. The cakes are moist and melt in your mouth. \nI have ordered several cakes from Simply Sweets and have always had a great experience. I now know to keep Simply Sweets business cards on hand, because everyone at the party wants the name of this amazing bakery, because they too have never tasted or seen anything so wonderful! The designs are amazing. For my daughter's birthday she wanted a tie dye peace sign cake- you should've seen her face when she saw her cake. It was absolutely amazing!! \n\nDo yourself a favor and order one for your next event."
1,"Let me start by admitting to not being a big Applebee's guy. The food is ~okay~ and I've had terrible experiences at other locations. Not at this one, however. It has been slow, but even then it wasn't due to server inattentiveness. I would definitely suggest bringing a light sweater because even in July, it's too cold in there. I love the staff here; our waitress last time was perfection. Plus: liquor. Happy hour here WINS. My MAIN issues with it is the temperature, and the fact that it can get very, very loud in there very quickly. And if you are one of the poor sobs that gets there during a dinner rush, I'll light a candle for you."
1,"Messy, fresh, juicy, greasy, and delish. The owner seems passionate about his store and he lets you know the moment you walk in that door. They were frying up several pounds of bacon when we arrived so it smelled amazing.\n\nThe burger was satisfying but I wasn't really feeling the special sauce a lot of people seem to love that you can get as a side for your fries, and it comes on the burger. Other than that, the chili fries were so good.Think crispy fries smothered with actually tasty chili and cheese. I wish I could have tried the Italian beef everyone seems to go on about, but I only have one stomach people."
0,"****THIS IS A REPOST OF MY PREVIOUS COMMENT BECAUSE IT WAS DELETED BY THE RESTAURANT******\n\nThis place is horrible. I wish I could tell you the chicken is rubber. I wish I could explain how rude the waiter was when he spilled scalding soup on my friends lap. The reason I can't tell you any of this is because my friends and I never got in. We arrived slightly early and spotted a parking spot right in front. Boom parking karma (Screeching brakes) until we can't fully pull in to the spot because of a drunken tweaker straddling the sidewalk. Should have tipped us off to how the evening was going to unfold. After sending ahead our low man on the totem pole we are told there will be a wait. Hey no problemo. It's 7:55 and we've got an 8:00 reservation. As we hang outside it becomes glaringly obvious this joint has no intentions of seating any of the folks who are waiting WITH RESERVATIONS. As we wait one of our group says he was tipped off to this place listening to a local San Francisco sports show. Lo and behold there is said morning show host Murphy(must be tough being named after a wedgie) blocking the front entrance and generally acting like a douche. Eventually we reached the breaking point and left when the host informed us that it would be a 90 minute wait from our reservation time. HA. The positive to the whole experience was the CD we bought off some dude outside while we waited. It had some awesome beats and the legendary track 7 titled \""Who the F**k are you?\"" came in handy when we circled the block and bumped the radio to 11 while letting Murph know he is a tool. Hey maybe next year I'll actually get inside to try some food."
1,"It's been awhile since this place was reviewed... and probably just as long since my last visit.  In the last few months (or possibly more), this restaurant changed names (it was previously 'The Counter') and cleared out the retail boutique area to make room for more seating.\n\nFuture yelper Nancie S suggested we meet for lunch here today, and I was impressed with the changes.  By no means is Chloe's Corner a high end restaurant... it's more like a retro diner with a modern feel.  It's the kind of place you order at the counter and pay for it, and then they bring your food to your table when it's ready.  It's also great for those who want to pick up something quick on the go...\n\nWe both ordered the chopped salad and a side of toasted cranberry walnut bread.  It was really tasty!  You can tell they use high quality ingredients... the salad is a unique combination of field greens, turkey, bleu cheese, walnuts, and grapes with poppyseed dressing.  I would for sure order it again although the tuna melt looked pretty amazing too!  There are several other 'classic' items on the menu such as grilled cheese, tomato soup, milkshakes, etc...\n\nEven more impressive than the lunch was the fact that I found a parking spot right away at Kierland and I left without going into one single store.  I'm so proud of myself for that... any fellow shop-a-holics know how hard that can be!\n\nAlthough I did like this place when it was \""The Counter,\"" it looks to me like the change that Fox Restaurant Concepts made to this restaurant was a good one!"
1,"This place is awesome. It's a nice chill spot after getting off work late and hanging out with friends. I love most of their warm milk teas, especially the almond milk tea. Actually, I pretty much like all of their milks teas, cold and warm. The staff pretty much leaves you alone except when you first get there (which is understandable). Their tactics for getting you to order instantly is a little intimidating I will admit. They just stand behind you until you're ready to order -_- I like how they place all of the teas on the shelves for everyone to see. It adds color and ambience to the place. I am already a regular and will continue to be one.\n\nSide note: I was iffy about coming here the first time because one of my close friends told me that she came here and hated it. She ordered regular boba drinks (not totally sure which ones) and almost all of her friends puked. My experience was nothing like this."
1,"Love, such a wonderful restaurant! Beautiful decor and extremely intimate. Service is outstanding and while you enjoy your decadent meal you can watch the Bellagio fountain erupt from your table. Must go!"
0,"Yeah, sorry. These people do not really know what they're talking about. Just trying to sell stuff. 2 stars for amount of supplies they carry. But They didn't have what I needed, and will not be going back."
1,I can always go hear after the gym and get my spicy chicken bowl with brown rice! YUM. Great Service and BOMB food!
0,"Total waste of time. We went on a Monday afternoon, and we walked around for 20 minutes trying to give Adventuredome an outrageous $16 ($8 per person) for a 1 minute roller coaster ride, but every ticket kiosk was closed. The few that were manned pointed us to other kiosks on the other side of the park, which all turned out to be closed (one was closed for \""counting inventory\""). The automated ticket machines they pointed us to, which looked like they were built in 1980, didn't even turn on. Eventually we gave up and spent another 15 minutes trying to find the exit so that we could return to the dumpiest casino we went to in Vegas."
1,This place is great. It is fresh and clean and has a bright cheery feel. There is always a new flavor to try and lots of choices to choose from at the toppings bar. The owners are always friendly and great to talk to.
0,Was a bit disappointed. Ate at about 7 PM and all the steaks were gone. Seemed strange. Service also seemed to be a second thought. Would not go back.
0,"This is my first and last time flying with US airways. It is worth spending more for a different company. The flight was delayed because of weather. Fine. Not there fault. However, how you deal with that as a company and in regards to customer service is key. I missed my 2nd flight because if the delay - despite it was the same company and if they had held that plane for just 5 minutes several of us would have made it. But instead they put us all on standby on the next flight, which is full, and also deluded over an hour. Then that flight gets delayed again. Oh, and if you don't get into this flight they will not pay for a hotel. They will give you a coupon, but that's it. Worst customer service I've ever experienced with an airline."
0,I work down the street and sometimes go there for their lunch deals. The best pizza for lunch always hot and fresh and the price for 3 slices and a drink is not bad. The problem I have is when you go there on your lunch if there is ever a table open you practically have to clean it yourself. I see dirty dishes everywhere and customers bussing their own tables. It's really not that hard to have your crew go through the restaurant every 10-15 mins and clean the tables. I don't like sitting at  a table with left over pizza crumbs and cheese all over the place. The fact maybe you don't have enough staff at lunch I don't know but every time I have gone in there it's the same thing. I hope the Barro's management sees this because i really like the food but hate to have to clean my own table just to sit down.
0,"Bugger Bagels. That's gross right? But that's what I call this Bruegger's on AZ Ave. This is going to sound super mean, but everything about this place is gross- like gag me with a spoon gross. The kitchen isn't clean, the tables are never bussed and the bagels are always a little crunchy and I can't tell you how many times I've seen the staff here handle food without gloves.\n\nExhale. Ok, I feel better."
0,ummm yeah.... update review ... came back here again 11 months later....\nsame thing... overcrowded... too many dudes... \ni agree the club is looks awesome and its huge... girls are hot too... but damn... too crowded and terrible ratio
1,"I have brought so many people here and nobody has ever been disappointed!  I haven't tried one thing that I haven't liked. Every time I try something it becomes my new favorite.\n\nGreat food great atmosphere great service... What else could you ask for.\n\nAlso, don't forget to bring Fido. They have a dog friendly patio!"
1,"My husband loves this place and I have to agree, their burgers are pretty damn good! \n\nI would appreciate a larger more diverse beer list, but for what it is, I will definitely go back!"
1,The food is awesome and you can pack as much as you want in the bowl and still take some home with you.  It is perfect as leftovers the next day! I would definitely keep going back!
0,"I went to this location today cause I had to return a product for my husband; he was looking for a specific brand that they didn't carry.  Anyways, the general manager (according to his tag) was absolutely rude during the return process (his name was Andy according to my receipts).  He was polite the day before when I bought the product, but today was a different story; I'm assuming he was about the return.  I would have liked to give this store a 1star, but my very first visit here was pleasant.  The guy working was polite & patient & answered my questions as best as he could; he was pretty well knowledgeable, unfortunately I cant remember his name"
0,"Eh? This place is definitely nice and the pool outside makes this area a good place to chill after dancing, but the long line and entrance fee are definitely not worth it.  Go to a club where the line isn't as long and hang out with your friends because if you go during memorial weekend, the guys better have money or else they won't get in."
1,So excited to be back and enjoy the new menu and beer selection. It was perfect on this rainy night!
0,"Good start and has potential, BUT I was only halfway through my soup when the waitress walked up and took it away. It was my main course. When she came back and I asked told what happened she went back to the kitchen to get me more and brought me a bowl of broth that looked like watered down salsa. My original soup had chicken, rice, and avocado. She charged me for it and I left hungry. Hopefully the place gets it's act together because the soup that I ate was quite good."
1,"They did a good job...I tend to judge it not just by the result but by how much attention the guy is giving your car.  He worked hard, and the interior looked great.  Would definitely return"
1,"Favorite food truck. Hands down. I need to stalk them more... OK, lets hop into it. First time I've had the pleasure of their cuisine was at Food Truck Fridays. They were out of a lot of the menu items as we arrived quite late. I ordered the Ooey Gooey Grilled Cheese and my friend got the Porky Sandwich, made with pickles and onions. Let it be known, here and now, the best grilled cheese has always come on thick, crunchy slices of sourdough bread so I was in love when I opened my box and found exactly that. \n\nThe sandwich was large and ooey gooey is right... it was shoved full of melted cheese and I was in heaven. Best part? I'm use to food trucks being a bit more pricey for one item but this sandwich also came with a side of parmesan herb fries which in one word is amazeballs. I bite heavily into my friend's pork sandwich (hey, we traded for a sample... I wasn't hijacking his food) and it was juicy and dripping with sauce. Another thumbs up for RF. \n\nI was quite satisfied after my meal and checked out their menu for future yummy evenings. Still need to sample oversized pork mac pimento cheese balls and have also heard the fish tacos are the best thing on the menu - can't believe I haven't had them yet as I love tacos and am a huge seafood fan - but I'm addicted to that grilled cheese and parmesan fries combo. \n\nRoaming Fork hasn't been at Food Truck Fridays lately (ummm come back) but I plan to make it a point to find them quite soon and indulge!"
1,"Had myself a trio sampler of Ghirardelli chocolate, vanilla, and Irish creme. All 3 were very tasty. Was pleased to see non-gluten free options were marked as such so I didn't have to out myself by asking. Used a blue spoon instead of green."
0,I will never eat here again ! The girls working as hostesses have no clue of customer service . We waited in line for over 35 minutes for a burger . Once we got seated we placed our order and the people next to us who came in 10 minutes after got their food well before us . The young lady who brought us our food told me the burger takes 30 to 40 minutes . The manager came over and asked how everything was and I told him the food was fine and the service was terrible ! He really did not seem to care . I have never written a review before but I felt the service was so bad I had to let people know that if you want to over pay for a burger with terrible customer service this is the place . This was all based on my experience today and they have lost me as a customer for life .
0,"The plan had been to eat at home.  Our friend, staying with us for the holidays, was out.  The two of us wanted to cook - we really did, but staring at the cats was taking up all of our time.  That and we were kinda at different stages of fighting off a cold.  Our friend called from the road - he was headed back to our place - and he was sick.  We said \""Bring home food\"".  He was planning to stop at Walgreen's and there was a brand new Little Caesars next to it (near the address listed for this review, but not yet even officially listed.  Mine was at 19th Avenue and Southern).  I was hesitant to go w/ that one - but I figured hey, it's new.  Places are normally better than usual when they are new, right?  \n\nHe got one cheese and one Peperoni.  Had it just been so many years since eating really really bad pizza that I just forgot what it was like?  Because this was NOT good pizza.  Greasy, sure.  But there was no flavor.  None.  It's like I had to check to see that I really had food in my mouth.  Sure, I could tell what it was supposed to taste like but a) Those were not high standards and b) It never even made it's own low standards.  \n\nYou must be thinking wow - 2 stars?  It sounds worse than that.  Here's my thought\n - I didn't get food poisoning.  Normal \""sick after eating bad greasy pizza\"" feeling still applied, but it wasn't as bad as it could have been.\n - The service was really fast as it is a \""to go\"" place - the pizzas are just waiting for customers to walk in the door\n - I was full after eating it\n - I didn't have to cook."
1,Really good fresh Asian food.  Very generous portions for a great price. They will customize your order with no issue. I will be back again!
0,Ordered delivery for the first and last time. Although delivery was prompt and driver pleasant the food in taste was poor. Although the lady I ordered from told me the egg rolls were hand made fresh in house it didn't impact taste. The egg rolls were extremely doughy and bland. Such thick dough I didn't finish even one. Couldn't put enough sauces to add flavor. I ordered fried rice and although the egg was cooked well in the rice the veggies were so light in color they looked like they were frozen then thawed while cooked in pan. Very disappointed. The rice and veggies were very flavorless also and unfortunately within an hour of eating this take out I was sick. Avoid this place. Too many other Chinese places in area to choose from.
1,"We had our door's panic bar changed and Mike the Technician did an excellent job. He knows what he's doing. You can tell that he loves his job because his customer service was.awesome. \nI would recommend this company to my friends and family.\nMike, thank you for the job well done!"
1,"Love going there in the Mornings, Best Staff and Fast Service!"
0,"Last night my dad had an epiphany...he purchased Groupons for AZ YO CO that are about to expire!! Ahhhhhhhh. So after our family dinner, we hopped in the car and headed to get frozen yogurt.\n\nThere weren't any other customers in the store when we walked in, but it was pretty late on a Sunday night. First thing I noticed was the lack of frozen yogurt options. They had a lot of machines but not a lot of flavors. So I looked around for the sample cups and to my disappointment I quickly realized this is one of those places that gets your samples for you. I HATE THAT!!! We will drive out of our way to avoid places like this. I don't know why it irritates me sooooo much, maybe it has something to do with the fact I'm a big girl, I can get my own sample of yogurt without making a mess. Careless folks ruin it for everyone I guess. \n\nThe yogurt wasn't good. It was very soft, borderline runny. \n\nThe toppings were lacking. If I wanted tons of candy, I would have been all set. But, since I wanted fruit, my options were limited. I could have strawberries, but they weren't fresh strawberries, it was like a chunky syrup. I could have cherries but I'd have to pick off all the stems, I could have pineapple...but I don't want pineapple, that sounds horrible on my half peanut butter, half cake batter yogurt. \n\nSo despite my dad telling me I needed to get $6 worth, I just couldn't. \n\n\nI'm glad this place isn't by my house since I have no desire to come back. But, it is by my parent's house...guess I should check yelp for better options for them."
1,"We haven't had our carpets cleaned in 4 years and they looked horrible. The crew came out today and made them look so much better! They were quick and very, very courteous. We will definitely have them back again... but sooner this time! I definitely recommend the crew on truck 2128 - Keith & Ray. Thank you!"
1,Awesome. Best chicken wings in town. Crispy on the outside juicy on the inside :)
1,"Great experience. I needed an oil change and tire check before a last minute road trip. I called ten minutes before closing last night to inquire about a next day appointment. The gentleman I spoke with was more than accommodating, said I could come in anytime. I requested right at 7am when they open. I went in this morning, in and out in about 35 minutes. No upsell nonsense. Nice, clean office and waiting area. Staff was all very friendly and polite. Will definitely be back!"
0,"This place has the worst service. Don't expect your server to be pleasant at all. They look like they just hate serving people and that it's a bother. They seem to forget that it's our money that's keeping them employed. \n\nI requested another round of bread and that was almost 30 minutes ago. Our glasses are always empty, no one has checked on us and our entree is still MIA after almost an hour. We've been here over an hour and our water has been refreshed once without asking for it. \n\nWe weren't advised of the specials. I think our bread is burning in the oven, still no sign of it and I've seen several tables receive bread already. \n\nDon't ever come to this place I know I will never come back to this place ever again and definitely will make sure that this is not on the list of restaurants that we recommend."
0,"Don't see this show....it is SO boring. I literally was dozing throughout the entire show. We got our tickets from a ridiculous time share presentation (were promised Ka and got bated and switched to this POS), so at least we didn't pay for it, but this show was just boring, had no discernable plot (maybe an angry fetus? not sure), had no impressive acrobatics...just don't waste your time and money."
1,"I am an absolute FAN of Trader Joe's! I could literally espouse their fantastic qualities for hours, but for the sake of anyone reading this, I will keep it short and sweet. Their prices are CHEAP (but are definitely NOT a reflection of the excellent quality of food and drink, etc) Their produce is always amazingly fresh. Their flower section is always stunning (and again, SO cheap it's ridiculous. I bought a huge, potted sweet basil plant for $2.99). Their wine selection is extensive, and full of quality wines as well as quirky brands I've never heard of and can find no where else. The atmosphere is clean and eco-friendly. My only complaint would be the somewhat slowness of the checkout lines. Overall, this place is my favorite place to grocery shop!"
1,"VEG OUT is the best ever!!! Not only are they 100% vegan but they do oil free on most of their food and list all allergies in food and often don't use them. Their food is super delish. As if that wasn't enough Justin and Stephaine the rockstar creators are AMAZING people who are always willing to share their smile and ear if you have any questions. They use a lot of local food to make their goodies and you can bring back you plastic containers they will recycle them for you. They also offer yummy teas, dark hot chocolate, fruit infused water and sweet treats as well. You just can go wrong with these two. Check em out at the Farmers Market. On thursdays at Springs preserve. Saturday at Trivolli, and Sundays at eastern and just south of 215 in the same plaza as BJ's. You won't be sorry. The herb garbanzo soup is a must as well as the chocolate lava cake."
1,"Giant sundaes, frozen Hot Chocolate and great mixed drinks, what more is there to say?  oh yeah, the menu has creative names and descriptions.  Great place for people watching or starting a spontaneous love quest with a five dollar bill and a book. (Movie reference).  \n\nI just wish the main courses were better.  I guess after watching food network for so long I should realize that Chefs who make good deserts are not the best cooks and vice versa.  The main dishes are mediocre.  Another overpriced location that makes up for the cost with the fabulous deserts.  Suggestion, eat dinner somewhere else, then come here for desert and sight seeing."
1,"Best hungover breakfast ever! Lived in the valley my whole life and can't believe ive never been here! Lots of great healthy options, very yummy, and good atmosphere/staff(thanks Christiana)"
1,"I had a problem with my new TV. I couldn't control the volume with the Cox remote, only with the new TV's remote, though everything else worked fine.  I called Cox and was connected with the tech person within one minute.  She worked on the problem and tried different fixes, but could not get it to work.  She didn't give up and was finally able to fix the problem.  I give her a lot of credit for resolving the problem in an effective and professional manner."
0,Worse place I ever went. Got there @ 5:30 to meet friends. Place had a very small crowd. Ordered a bit before 6. Never got my sandwich served to me.( also happened to another in our party of 10)  Others in party had finished eating.\nOne excuse after another. finally left at 7:10\nWaitress even wanted a tip !
1,"What a great company. Not only were they fast, they made sure that we were happy with the products and their labor. We paid what was quoted and they were done when they promised. The owners were on site to ensure our happiness. Our back yard is wonderful and our front yard is awesome. The landscape make the house look brand new. They also used products from America to help make our country strong and ensure the quality of the artificial grass! The crew was outstanding and courteous to me and my family. Our neighbors cannot believe the difference in our yard in only two days. Showready Landscape is the best contractor that we have ever dealt with in our 20 years here in Las Vegas. We cannot say enough great things about them."
1,"All local indie designers all the time! Including sexy stuff for dudes! The General is owned by the same supafly ladies who own Local 23 up the street - http://www.yelp.ca/biz/local-23-montreal-3 The General features fresh indie designs including homewares and art prints. If you are an artist or designer you can bring your work in, have a friendly chat with about your work and price point, and if accepted start to sell on consignment right away. One of the owners is the designer behind Glasgow designs, she has a great eye and is very sympathetic to what makers are going through. They also have amazing summer sales, and really fun vernissage events which they promote through their blog."
0,"I tried to sign up for there $29.99 monthly special. The attendent told me I would need to sign up next time I came in and they were already full for this month (no real managment on site) and very unprofessional. He did not seem interested in signing me up like it was to much trouble. As I was leaving I looked for a phone number or web site address but none is displayed, very suspicious that they do not give any contact info. at there business site. I was using this car wash three to four times a week, now I am going to join a ligimate car wash, there are several close to this one."
0,"If I could give zero stars I would. We hadn't come to this restaurant in a while and couldn't remember why so we decided to go. It was a little busy but not too much, about 3 groups ahead of us. After we were seated they brought us bread and 2 packets of butter. It took about 5 minutes or so before they brought the silverware to spread the butter. While we were waiting for our order we overheard one waitstaff tell another not to bus a table otherwise they would keep seating people... Seriously! Eventually our food came. We got the Prime Rib BBQ burger and Parmesan Crusted Chicken. The prime rib on the burger was nothing but fat (what did I expect for $10 right). The Parmesan crusted chicken was terrible. It had the weirdest flavor, it tasted mostly like fish. Which means they probably don't clean their grill very well. Doubt we will ever give this place another chance, bad food coupled with bad service puts this place on my \""do not go to\"" list."
0,I have been waiting since Mon. For accounting to return my phone call it is Thurs. Even escalated it to a manager he still hasn't returned my phone calls! \nI don't think this is a corporate renaissance!!  Feels like a franchise!  But I need someone to take ownership of this Marriott rewards issue!  Not the first time I have stayed here & always have a billing issue!!!! Never fails!!! **BEWARE****\nThe front desk personnel don't know correct information about their rewards program! Glad I am writing this so I'll remember why this will be the last hotel I choose to stay at when in Vegas.
0,"How hard is it to take my order and give me what I ordered? The last three times have been progressively worse. Last time, order just nachos. Pico de Gillo, quac, and sour cream on the side. Get home, no PdG, no quac, no sour cream. Tonight, fish taco plate and nachos (same way as last). Nachos are fine, my fish taco plate magically turned into some sort of squashed enchilada thing in red sauce. HOW DO YOU SCREW THIS UP? I WAS THE ONLY CAR IN THE DRIVE THRU AND YOU REPEATED THE ORDER BACK TO ME. I'm miles away now and can't go back. If I ever do. The food is just OK. It will be a long while before I go back. Even the beans and rice where nearly flavorless."
1,"I usually do not eat at restaurants like these because it's not your typical menu. However, I tried about 9 different items from the menu and they all blew me away! It was absolutely amazing food! The meatballs especially!"
0,"alright I'm back, the kids really wanted a treat, so here we are. I'm always up for a second chance and I will say, the pomegranate sorbet was good. we skip most of the toppings and I'm still freaked out by the idea of people handling the machines and the germ factor. we were here 30 minutes and it got quiet, no customers in line and the 2 guys behind the counter never stepped out and wiped down tables or cleaned up the spills under the dispensers.  attention to detail is really what gets 5 stars."
1,"Our local \""greek\"" place. We are there at least once a week for lunch eating their delicious gyro pitas and greek fries and once in a while we have the uber-delicious and very filling Moussaka! Although there are plenty of other great item on the menu."
0,"This place was horrible!  Thw waitress was very nice, however it took 40 minutes to get our soup and grilled cheese.  When we got the soup.....of course it was cold and it was not good at all!"
1,"Stayed here on Fri-Sat for a girls' bday weekend in LV. Aria was amazing. We got bumped up to a higher room with a strip view (double score!) AND got two free buffet passes for Aria's buffet.\n\nEverything is automatic. Things are controlled with an electronic I-pad/phone type gadget so I had trouble with it, but anyone with a smartphone would have appreciated its versatility.\n\nBathroom was great. It was huge, double-sinked and came with a shower and jacuzzi. \n\nService was SO amazing throughout the hotel. We've had crappy service at other hotels before but every single person (from the valet to the business office staff to the front desk staff) were courteous, patient, and professional.\n\nWould definitely, definitely stay here again."
0,"Lunch is not as cheap as it is at a lot of places.  Portion size was enough food for lunch but, I'm used to having leftovers.\n\nI had some errands to run in University and I was hungry.  I've got a \""go to\"" Chinese spot about 5 miles in any direction from here but, didn't have the time today, so here is where I ended up.\n\nIts right near the lake, along with Ciro's, Zapata's, Boardwalk Billy's.  The decor is nice but, nothing special.  They have some booths and some tables.  I was promptly seated in a pretty much empty restaurant in one of the booths.  My waiter was quick and polite.  I wasn't extremely thrilled to not see a single meal for under $6 and that they didn't come with soup.  What can I say, I'm spoiled.  I went with the beef and broccoli.  It came out within 5 minutes.  The broccoli was barely cooked but I liked it.  The little pieces of beef were in a brown sauce that was quite salty.  My egg roll was leaking a Valdez style pool of oil in this over-salted sauce.  I've seen this before, when the egg roll has a whole and it and it just soaks up the oil.  My waiter was quite attentive but, nothing was going to save this meal.\n\nIf in a hurry, you can grab a decent bite for under $10 for lunch.  But, as soon as I left I saw that Zapata's has a $6.99 lunch special including drink next door, Ciro's is good Italian food, and of course if you really want Asian there's always Thai House across the street."
0,Based on the reviews we read on RestoMontreal we decided to go to this resturant.  The service was extremely slow.   It took over an hour to bring our pizzas after ordering.  The crust on two of the pizzas were awfull! Very tough and inedible.  In addition this resturant is expensive for what you get.
0,"I must be a snobby snobby bitch. \nNope... just sober.\nTrust me, I tried to remedy that as quickly as possible so I could deal with this place. We were there on a Saturday evening around 9. Maybe it's okay as a Sunday day drinking spot but I'll never know,  because I'll never be back.\n\nLong story short:\nI came uncomfortably close to getting into a physical altercation with a man. Yes, all 112lbs of me and some of you will be surprised that I was not the instigator. I was NOT. \nYou know that look.... that certain \""sociopath\"" type look that serial killers have; the eyes are set a little too close together and their head slightly resembles a loaf of bread, pinched in at the temples. Well that's this guy....annnnnnd all of his equally roided out homies. The experience was actually scary and I don't scare easily. \n\n\""Killer\"" wasn't the only reason for the sour taste in my mouth. The place was a little campy/cheesy and not really in the way I like. I can't really put my finger on it but it just wasn't my thing. The service was slow but the place was packed to the gills with every ass clown on the planet, so I'll cut them some slack there. We wanted to eat but there was no place to sit, as any of the open tables had reserved signs on them. Oh........reallllly, bottle service anyone? LAME \nI'm not sure if that was the case or not, it just seemed douchey and try hard. Shocking\n\nI will say one thing. This experience and the few others that I've had leading up to it have made me come to terms with something very special. I don't belong here and by here I mean Scottsdale. Unless of course someone would like to take me to City Hall for a sexy steak dinner. That's my idea of a good time. I doubt highly I'll fear getting punched in the face at Mastro's. \nFuck I'm old...."
0,I hate that MOST of the Roberto's cooks never wear gloves while cooking food ! They even sprinkle the cheese with their bare hands! Disgusting !!!!!!
0,"I really don't get why people love this chain so much.  That's great that the burgers are not frozen but when I eat them I don't get a good meaty flavor, all I taste is grease.  I very much prefer the sirloin burgers at Jack-in-the-Box.\n\nAnd I don't like the whole \""secret menu\"" concept.  Call me crazy, but I want to know what my options are when I walk into a restaurant, not have to study a website beforehand.\n\nThis place is just not my thing, I guess."
1,"I've been coming here since this place was called Taza, then Jai Ho, and now Taj Palace.  I'm not sure why the name changes but either way the food is always good.  I by no means am an Indian Food expert but my experiences here are always good.  The curries are as spicy as you want them.  The nan is delicious (I love the garlic nan), and the Tandoori chicken is always piping hot and tasty.  \n\nIf you're not familiar with Indian food or really hungry, be sure to hit up their lunch buffet.  There are a lot of choices at a very reasonable price.  The servers are also very helpful as I try to order something new on each visit.  Also, be sure to keep an eye out in local publications for coupons and specials!"
1,"My dinner experience at Le Cirque was one of those that was so good I'll remember it for years.\n\nThe food: They have a tasting menu and an ala carte menu.  We did the ala carte menu.  However, they provided a small appetizer which was a butternut squash soup with mini marshmallows.  It was soooooooo good.  If it was a regular menu item, I would've ordered a gallon of it.  \n\nFor the main course, I had the Coeur de Filet de Boeuf which was to die for.  The portion was not to big and the foie gras that came on the side was excellent.  \n\nFor dessert, they gave each table a cute tray with assorted petite fours.  I tried one or two of them and they were excellent.  My boyfriend had the chocolate souffle which was perfect, the level of sweetness was just right.  I had the creme brulee which was perfect, it came with a small scoop of lemon gelato that was topped with edible gold... yes, that's right, edible gold.  Finally, they do give each table a really cool gift box that has two delicious truffles.\n\nThe food was excellent and you could tell they put a lot of thought into their dishes.\n\nService: Truly amazing.  I was a little worried that my boyfriend and I were going to deal with condescending waiters who would label us as young kids who had no business in being in a frou frou restaurant.  This was not the case at all.  Everyone was polite and courteous and we got the same level of service that the other customers got.  Every staff member knew where they had to be and you could see how everything worked like clockwork.\n\nAmbiance:  Its a small restaurant which for me, made me feel special.  It's circus themed with the ceiling looking like a tent top.  Paintings are of circus scenes.  My favorite thing though were the dishes.  They were monkey themed and I am the hugest monkey fan.  The restaurant has a view of the Bellagio fountains.\n\nAfter my experience, I understand why this restaurant is a 5 star award winner.  While the prices may scare you away, I say its worth going and checking out.  It will definitely be one of your most memorable meals."
0,"I went in to order some take out and won't be back. Nobody greeted me. When I read the small sign that said to order at the register in the back, I stood there for three minutes while two members of the staff awkwardly looked at each other neither of them even acknowledging me.  I will not be back. Service and staff don't know what customer service is."
1,The food was great and the atmosphere/presentation was amazing as well.  The food has a unique urban touch but is still more or less traditional Thai.
0,Again major disappointment at the store. No screen savers for gallery s3 what a lame store. And the employees need to take a customer service class they are rude and have no customer skills. Verizon needs to fire the whole management staff and hire managers that are customer serviced skilled
0,If I could leave no stars I would. What a horrible company from the experience to the way they treat you AFTER you have signed on the dotted line!! My mom and I paid cash to have our pools done. I could not get any cooperation as far as phone calls and advance notice on anything. I have kids and dogs and it was just not suitable to my everyday life to have random people show up whenever they pleased. They talk to you like they are doing you a grand favor and make you feel like you have just no idea what is going on or that you shouldn't. Sad that spending $50-$60k can't get you any kind of courtesy. I would NOT NOT NOT recommend this company!! This was for the one located off of Blue Diamond.
1,"This is my mom's favorite place to eat.  The breakfast food is delic!  The salads are good portion and come with a muffin.  \n\nWe were there for lunch on a Sunday two weeks ago.  We had family from out of town, plus my mom, husband, and kids.  The waiter was the best.  He was efficient, friendly, and the drinks were never empty (my husband's test for good service).  We were sitting within five minutes with are large party.  The food came out pretty quickly.  No complaints."
1,"I recently moved to the area and was looking for a good place to take my dry cleaning. My neighbor recommended this place to me, telling me that the staff is friendly and that they take care of their customers. It's a family owned store and they have two other locations, which makes it very convenient for me in case I have errands to run in those areas. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good cleaners in Gilbert."
1,best bagels in town. no more to say
1,"We made our first visit to Longhorn a couple weeks ago, tempted by the $4.99 steak dinner special. Aside from one line of gristle in the steak, it was an amazingly good dinner -- salad (or soup), steak, potato, vegetables and a huge roll -- for an unbeatable price! We certainly weren't expecting much, but we were very pleasantly surprised. So we decided to stay and play some video poker for awhile. They have a good range of denominations, but are limited on the games they have (many of the machines carry the identical games -- little variation, and no Triple Double Bonus). We've returned numerous times already, and each of us has won a progressive jackpot so far (between $1000 and $1200). This is also one place we've found where you can actually wear shorts (when it's warm outside) and not freeze to death inside! We've also eaten again at the Chuck Wagon (didn't get the steak this time) and were not disappointed! The country fried steak was melt-in-your-mouth and the pork chops were very flavorful as well. They also have some desserts that look amazing. The menu has plenty to choose from at very reasonable prices; we plan on returning soon."
1,"Wooohooo!  Great service, great atmosphere, great change from last movie house that was there.  The place has been completely redecorated and updated to Scottsdale chic.  Popcorn was served in open basket, easy to eat w butter on the side (love it!).  Good drinks, and free refils on the soda.  This was a good purchase and a great value for the money.  I advise anyone to try it.  :)"
1,"It's a dive.  But as far as dives go, it's awesome!  We've been going there for years, not regulars though, we're homebodies.  Services has always been friendly/  And, karoke on Sat's is great!  If you aren't a snob, try it out :)"
0,"The market does have just about everything one would need for most any Asian cuisine but it's more geared toward Chinese and some Vietnamese.  The seafood department is very good as far as selection is concerned and if you get lucky, the service from the Mexican staff is good.  The checkout staff can be rude and totally uncaring.\n\nMy gripe is that I used my credit card to pay for my items.  Within a short time I receive a fraud alert from the Card company that several attempts to use the card had been blocked.  One transaction from China, one from Best Buy for over $1500 among others.  The only way this could happen would be for the cashier or someone with access to the transaction details to pass the information onward.\n\nI called the manager the next day  (I paid for the goods at 5:34pm and immediately left for a 2 hour drive home).  He at first voiced skepticism that this could take place at his place of business but I told him that I was only warning him of the occurrence and that he should conduct an investigation to prevent this.  He promised to do so and call me back the following day.  It's been 5 days with no response. \n\nJust a heads-up."
0,"Previous stay here was great about 3 years ago.  This time our room card key didn't work...had to replace them twice.  We found that housekeeping didn't shut our door completely when we returned from breakfast.  Unacceptable.  We were awaken 3/4 nights that we stayed by different guests every night talking so loudly in hall between 2-6 a.m.  Lady across hallway was not pleased either, so she opened her door and told them to keep it down.  One night someone tried jamming their card key in our door until my husband yelled for them to stop.  Won't stay at this hotel again."
0,"what?!?!? really it is the hilton!!!! so many things went wrong! first we originally booked a king gave us a double... then they switched us out the next day only to have a clogged tub!!! then the room they switched us out.. people were still occupying it!! so the last room they gave us.. sink didn't work, tub was dripping really badly, and the phone didn't work!!! by then we were way exhausted to change rooms!!! the hallways were dirty! the rooms were dusty!!! etc!!! WE HATED IT!"
0,"First of all let me say that this McDonalds doesn't have a sign in their drive thru stating that they charge for Ranch. \nSecond of all customer service sucks here. I know that you can't expect them to treat super great but at least have respect. The stupid cashier at the 2nd window was Rude about me asking for ranch then got her manager which wasn't that nice either.\nThird of all when I get home, my order is missing! I was missing one of our burgers. \nThen I try to call them but no answer. Why do they have a phone if they won't answer? So guess what store#18966 I call the 800 number and did a complaint. Hope you learn to have respect, I'm not asking for u to all happy and jolly JUST RESPECT!\nForgot to mention that my husband's fries where half way full! What's wrong with them!"
0,"WTF!!!  As you know, I like this place a lot!  For its food.  But they never post their menu on their website and when you call, nobody knows what's on the menu for the day.  How stupid is that.  So I called again today and they put me thru to their Food And Beverage Department and they picked up the phone and hung up on me.  I know this for a fact because I called back 3 times and each time the operator connected me to F&B, this happened.  How freaking stupid and inconsiderate is that?\n\nPerhaps we should not frequent this place again."
0,"I never write reviews but I felt like my experience here called for one. My husband and I were really excited to try this place for brunch on New Year's Day, but we left feeling completely disappointed and unsatisfied, if not somewhat disgusted. I will say that the cocktails and crispy confit duck wings were delicious. However, the chicken fried chicken sandwich and pork tostada, the two reasons we selected this restaurant in the first place, were awful. The chicken fried chicken was anything but. What was served instead was mushy dark meat chicken formed together in a patty like mold, breaded and lightly fried. The texture was so off putting and impossible to eat as a \""sandwich\"". It was like fried chicken tartare slapped on an English muffin. Even worse was the pork tostada. The pork was drenched in liquid smoke. The taste was so artificial and it lingered in my mouth for close to an hour after we left. We had to go to another restaurant for a drink to wash the taste from our mouths. \n\nI understand this is a new restaurant and they are still working out the kinks. Their menu is very promising but the recipes  need some major work. And unfortunately, though their dinner menu sounds fabulous, after this terrible experience, we won't likely be back to try it. \n\nSadly, not a good way to start 2015."
0,"Total waste of money. It might be worth it if you sit outside to view the fountains but that would be it. It was so loud inside that my wife and I gave up on trying to yell out a conversation and communicated by hand signals. A loud restaurant I can forgive, but the food was also poorly cooked and flavorless. My Ribeye, if it even was a Ribeye, was cut so thin it could have been a skirt steak. It was also burnt and greasy. Then they covered it in a bland red wine reduction that literally had no flavor. My wife's chillian sea bass was dry and her beans were under cooked and hard. The only saving grace was the bread and tapenad. Never again."
0,This is for the cafe. The wraps are overpriced for something that can finished in 3 bites. Ugh! Wish I knew!! The only thing that's worth the $12 is the burger and breakfast sandwich. Not worth the money n the journey to find breakfast food.
1,the fix my i phone 5 the use the best part in town all original lcd  jolian is the best technician in town thank you.
1,"This place is one of the more high end malls in Arizona, second to Scottsdale Fashion  mall about 50 min away. Chandler has a full range of department stores from Sears level to Nordstrom and Dillards so its great for just about everyone. Recent stores that just opened up include H&M and there are quite a bit of specialty stores as well. \n\nThe only issue I have with this place is that the athletic shoe store quality here is not the best so you will need to find them elsewhere. The best store here for athletic shoes is Footlocker, and they are constantly out of shoes to try out for common sizes (mens 10-11). Aside from that, you should be fairly satisfied with the range of stores in this mall."
0,"Tricia's comment is absurd, I question anyone reading this to think how there estheticians would come up with this theory about eyebrow waxing as you are suppose to have some privacy after your waxing. I took and extra minute getting ready after my wax because I was noticing what a bad wax job had been done, I explained this to Tricia . I had no intention of ever coming there again because it's so rushed now this is evident by many other reviewers like one lady who was told she could not even use the restroom before her wax. I posted my original review because it is really disappointing the changes I have no idea why the owner is trying to refute it with her unsubstantiated eye brow waxing story . Sad...."
0,"We had high hopes given the reviews.  We expected a nice dinner, but young people from a travel blog appeared suddenly and catering to them was a much higher priority than patrons for the restaurant staff.  Rather than seating them or us somewhere else, we had to endure endless sound checks and mindless PR drivel.  Food is good, not your usual Mexican/American fare, but pricey.  If they are hosting the Wichita Falls Travel Blog when you arrive, have a margarita and the guacamole, then go somewhere else for dinner."
1,"My bucket list is to attempt to visit all HRC locations!!  So, I'm now crossing off Phoenix location!\n\nDined in and enjoyed all the memorabilia displayed. New location in downtown PHX next to the D-Backs stadium.  Seems to get a good amount of traffic during events but during the weekend it wasn't busy at all.  Sat at the bar ordered a sampler platter and food was pretty good.  Big fan of the restaurant and collected a new pin to add to my collection."
0,"Excellent food, but the service left much to be desired.\n\nThis is the first time I have eaten at the Whale & Ale. I went with a group of coworkers for lunch -- many of whom have enjoyed dinners there before -- and while I expect a pub to take a little while to prepare a large order of food at lunch, today we waited almost an hour after ordering for our food to arrive. At no point was there any apology or acknowledgment of the delay, and the only reason we knew they hadn't completely forgotten us was because I asked repeatedly how long we would be waiting. (I never did get a straight answer.) The food finally arrived just seconds after I told them our party needed to leave. The serving staff were completely disengaged. I actually felt kinda guilty for leaving any tip at all.\n\nI might try this place again for a dinner, as the food was good. But I will avoid the Whale & Ale for lunch again... I don't have 2 hours to waste during a work day."
1,"Right after I wrote my first review of this place, a groupon deal popped up that would let me try the pizza. I jumped right on it and used it today for lunch. \n\nWe came in about 3pm and it was pretty crowded. The pizza oven was going, and there were lots of people sitting around eating gelato. A lot more crowded than the last time we came in, that's for sure. We ordered lunch, I got the marinara pizza and my husband ordered the chopped salad. The wait time for our lunch was pretty minimal. A little over five minutes. My pizza came out first and it was pretty delicious. The crust was thin, with just the right amount of fluffy in the edges, and with a nice char on the bottom from the pizza oven. The sauce was tangy and had a nice array of spices in it. It was also covered in garlic and fresh basil leaves. I really enjoyed this pizza. My husbands salad was lettuce, chopped carrots, cucumbers, roasted corn, cherry tomatoes, parm, all in a very tasty vinaigrette on top of a piece of flat bread. His salad was also very delicious. Our coupon covered our whole meal plus two small scoops of gelato, but the prices of our lunches was pretty reasonable. I would come back here to eat the food again.\n\nThe gelato on the other hand, is still not my favorite. I had strawberry today and didn't finish it again. I don't know what it is about the gelato here, but I am just not crazy about it. Hence the four stars. The pizza and salads are great though. Come try those."
1,"If not THE, then one of the best chicken shwarma dishes I've had. Just the right degree of succulent and tender. And the garlic, yogurt sauce that comes with it is almost like crack. The jasmine rice was perfect in its softness and saltiness. Taboule was good and the pita was mmm..mmmm...good. Hummus was awesome too. Definitely going back to work my way down the menu. My friend who recommended it said she'd never had any bad item there. I totally believe her."
1,"There's nothing I don't LOVE about Char's.  Oh wait, they have a tiny womans bathroom and when you stand up in one of the stalls everyone can see you head... weird but when you have a few drinks in you it doesn't bother you as much.  \n\nI love the regular bands, Lady J and Bad News Blues, really great.  The wait staff is always nice and quick to bring back the drinks.  It can be a bit of a sausage fest sometimes but I the guys have always been respectful and I've never hesitated coming here alone for that reason. \n\nThe dance floor is really small but again, once you get a few in you it doesn't matter."
0,"If I could I would give our March 2014 meal at Nobu @ Caesar's Palace 0 stars for service and 4 stars for food; 2 stars is my compromise. The exceptionally high prices are a given. Our lunch for 4 cost $500, and we weren't too full to skip dinner. The food, in general, was very tasty. Surprising standouts included the shishito peppers and the spicy miso chips with big eye tuna. The kumamoto oysters were shockingly disappointing; without the salsa toppings, they would have been completely flavorless. The black miso cod was also disappointing, probably because it was not as warm as it could have been. Which leads me to the real problem with the meal--the service. Our waiter, Ryan, was exceedingly condescending from the get-go. Beyond that, he spoke way too fast (and this was the consensus from 3 New Yorkers) while also failing to enunciate. He arrived at the table with way too much attitude and launched into his poorly delivered spiel despite our telling him that one of our party of four was in the rest room. When that person returned, he was less than willing to fill her in on what she'd missed. Ryan kept wanting us to let him design our menu, but since my preference would have been to see him fired on the spot, I was not inclined to let him choose our food. I cannot overemphasize how much undeserved attitude Ryan was dishing out. Our group had never seen anything like it, and between the four of us, we have eaten in great restaurants around the globe. Beyond the service problem of Ryan himself, we were also quite unhappy about the tremendous speed with which each course arrived at the table and the equally swift way in which even not yet finished plates were whisked away. One could either eat one's food as quickly as possible, without having the opportunity to savor it, or let it sit on the table, growing cold, as my black cod did. I've had significantly slower fast food. In general, I don't like to rate the quality of a restaurant based on its service rather than its food, but in this case, the horrendous service made the food much less palatable. Nobu management should be embarrassed by the restaurant's service failings."
0,"I never want to come back here again. Long story short, they made my sandwich right in front of me and when my boyfriend and I took our food home, his sandwich was correct but mine belonged to the man who was before me. I called to make a complaint because it wasn't mine and we had to drive a good distance away and were finally home, only to realize it wasn't my food. The girl was unapologetic, telling me to just bring the food back with my receipt and they would fix it and that was it. No sorry, no anything. We drove back to return the sandwich and they took a long time trying to find my order on their screen but I heard them mentioning the mans order before mine, and my boyfriends order after mine. They then asked me what kind of sandwich was in the bag, I told them i didn't know and they opened up and examined it, only to say \""Oh it was that man's earlier.\"" They were again, unapologetic and I told them I just wanted my money back and they both went to their break area or side area to call the manager and handed me the phone. The manager was nice, he said I could get a refund and a 6in. of what I ordered and I got it, but the customer service as far as the two workers that were there was shit and I don't want to ever go to this Subway again. Very careless. The manager even told me they have four markers in the store to mark what kind of sandwich is what and it shouldn't have happened. Regardless, it was a very irritating experience."
1,"I am so happy that The Clever Koi is open. It gives me hope that smart inventive people will start colonizing Central Phoenix.  The Clever Koi has a laid back, unpretentious vibe.  It's a great place to hang out after work.  Overall I had an excellent experience.  First they have a great selection of wines that you don't typically see other places.  I'm not sure if they are connected to the wine bar next door, but I appreciate that there was something different to choose from.\n\nWe ordered a selection of dishes.  The low point was the Wood Fired Grill Plate which was just so/so.  Everything else was delicious, particularly the corn dogs. \n\nWe live a block away so I am sure that we will become regulars."
1,"I love shopping at this store. I always get great dresses that are comfy and decently priced. They also have a great selection of preowned clothes in the back too. The acessories and fab as well. I love their selection of earrings and someone they work with or know makes these awesome leather cuffs. They have paintings, incense, candles and so much more. They ladies that work there are great helpers while shopping and super nice to talk to as well!"
0,"HOW can gus's cafe be considered vegan-/vegetarian-/gluten-free friendly?  i made a reservation for 9 vegan/vegetarians, so they were well aware that we were coming.  the menu had a VERY limited selection of vegan/vegetarian options, and the front of the  menu stated that they no longer were gluten-free friendly or something to that effect.  the service was extremely slow.  i had to ask for menus for everyone, and the waitress seemed surprised we were eating - apparently she just  thought we were there to drink - even though we had a reservation.  there were no veggie burgers listed on the menu, so i asked if they had them, and the waitress said that yes, although they did have them (why aren't they listed on the menu????), there were only 3 left!  that left 6 of us scrambling to find something else on the menu, which was not easy, as there were VERY few options for vegans/vegetarians.  this experience was a dud from the time that we arrived until the time that we left.  i have a groupon for this place, which i plan to give to someone, as i'll never return!\n\nDEANA M:  when a restaurant is touted in the pittsburgh post-gazette and the tribune-review as being vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free friendly, that's what they should be.  the articles were geared specifically for that purpose.  gus's is none of those and, therefore, deserves my one-star review."
0,"It was okay Boo for upping  the price shouldnt it be cheaper if you come later ?not as nice as X/S located  in the same vacinity  as Surrender but it was okay.

You will have a customer for life in me."

0,"We stopped by here to have some food on Wednesday because Da Vang is closed.  After placed the order, my husband took our sons to the bathroom and they came out and said it was too dirty and smelly. I went to the women one was fine but the paper was on the floor and seemed like no one care clean up.  While we were waiting for our food, the server/bus boy was cleaning the table on the other side of my husband and he just threw the plates to the basket and made a very loud noise. My sons were scared and so was I. Found out that the people that just left, did not leave any tips. \nThe food was not that good. The soup was little salty and my husband rice dish with grilled pork was too dry. It is so obvious that we will never return to this restaurant and will not recommend it to anyone in the family or friends."
0,"the brisket is very dry, lacks flavor. the pulled pork lacks flavor. both meats were over cooked around the edges to the point of black. this place microwaves everything, even the roll (which i had to remind them that my lunch combo came with). the baked beans came right out of a can tastes like the store brand not even bushes. the food was very salty. you can't put salt on meat and call that seasoned. i will not return. i can microwave better food at home than this."

1,"My friend had been talking about this place for a while, so we finally got the chance to meet up for a snow cone. They are located in the back corner of a parking lot, just behind the Shell gas station on Eastern and Sunridge Heights. \n\nService was friendly and they offered us up as many samples as we wanted to try before committing to a flavor. I was initially interested in trying the caramel corn flavor but it was a little too sweet for me, so I opted for a fruitier option with grapefruit and added sour spray to make it a little tangier. My friend Sam opted for pear and we were both incredibly pleased with our snowcones. They were a little on the sweet side, but I think that was mostly due to them having used a little too much flavoring on the kid's size. I'll have to try a larger size next time and I'm really interested in trying their freckled frog next time for a zero calorie option that is lemon juice, salt and chile limon. \n\nAccording to their web site none of their flavors are made with high fructose corn syrup. Also, make sure to check out their Facebook page for specials and double punch stamp days."
0,"I've been to Havana caf\u00e9 before, but it's been at least 5 years or so. Long enough for me to forget that this place was forgettable, in my own opinion. Take that for what it is, I don't eat much Cuban food.\n\nI was unexcited to find that Havana caf\u00e9 didn't have any spots available to park, and the rest of the open spots in the parking lot were all labeled specifically for the next door flower shop, coffee shop, and so on. What was I to do? I risked it and parked in a flower shop spot, and well, I wasn't towed, but I still felt like I was doing something wrong by parking there :-/\n\nUltimately, I was lured back with a groupon they had available a few months ago. My first mistake was expecting that I could use my groupon to pay for meals which both totaled above $30 (the value of my groupon) and ALSO ordering additional items from their HH menu. I asked for two of their mojitos and was told that I couldn't order HH since I was using a groupon also. I obliged and let them know that water was just fine. My guess is they realized I wanted to buy my drinks in addition to our meals, and the waitress came back a few minutes later and told us she would put our drink order on a separate check. Nice save on their part - I was a bit miffed at first!\n\nMy second mistake was not realizing how excessively sweet their mojito was going to be. I saw at the bottom of the glass, what appeared to be a large spoonful of sugar. In this case, it didn't help the medicine go down. After them accommodating me with the drink order and all, I didn't want to make a big to do out of this, so I soldiered my way through my drink.\n\nI ordered a shredded beef dish, and my wife a shredded/pulled pork dish. Apparently Cuban's like bell peppers and onions a heck of a lot more than I do. The peppers and onions with my dish accounted for about 3/4th's of the meal. I ate two or three slices of the peppers and a few slices of the onion, but was not satisfied with the small amount of beef the meal came with for a sticker price of $16, and even at $8 since I was paying about half with the groupon.\n\nMy third mistake was choosing to sub their house vegetables for the beans and rice. I don't eat that many carbs, so often I will exchange potatoes, fries, rice, etc for whatever vegetable is available. The waitress explained that it was a mixture of squash, zucchini, mushrooms, and a few others. In reality, it turned out to be a few slices of squash, a few slices of zucchini, a couple of mushrooms, and guess what, a bucket load of chopped bell peppers and chopped onions. They were also nice enough to charge me extra for the substitution with the meal now totaling $18 before tax and tip.\n\nTwo $6 mojito's, two $16 meals, an upcharge for the vegetables, and a $5 forgettable appetizer (I don't exactly remember what it was at this point). I was leaving with a $65 meal after tax and tip, hey, I saved $15 on the groupon though.\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix, I hope I made it apparent how unimpressive this spot is. Maybe you prefer pan fried peppers with a bit of beef and a side of... pan fried peppers."
0,"HOLY COW! First great spot on the strip, great looking place. BAD: The 19 minutes we wait (after we sat down) for any type of service. Now, ok, maybe nobody saw us. OR the fact that 2 managers were talking less than 6 feet away THE ENTIRE TIME didn't see us too. It's vegas, not too many people are in a rush, and neither were we. So I decided to wait, and wait, and wait, and wait...for 19 minutes. THEN I asked the managers, \""Is 20 minutes the right number to wait before service\""?. They were sorry, comp'ed 1 drink and went along with their day. BEST PART, I happen to run into another manger weeks later and he offered to show me the right service levels. Maybe I go back, but with so many great places on the strip....maybe not."
1,"This place is a hidden gem! First and foremost, the coffee is unreal. Easily the best Americano I have had in Montreal. The food is also delicious and incredibly affordable. All bagel-style sandwiches are made on St. Viateur bagels. You can add a side salad and potatoes for a few extra dollars. \n\nThe atmosphere is perfect- amazing decor (eclectic) and the place is never too busy! I guess that's because it's a bit hard to notice from the outside, since there isn't extensive signage. \n\nBonus features: the male cook is a babe! :)"
0,"I'd like to review this pool, but we never went in.  What I can review is my experience on the outside.  While my husband and I were scouting out the pools we wanted to hit while in Vegas for a week, we went to check out Bare since we were hanging out at the Mirage that day.  Here's how I can describe my experience. Remember in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts tries to go shopping and the sales lady tells her that they have nothing for her?  Yeah, that's how they made us feel.  Oh they didn't SAY that, but when we asked about the pool at the entry area, we were told things like \""It's very expensive\"" and \""You have to be in beach attire\""  (well, duh) all while being looked up and down.  \n\nYeah, we're not hot skinny young meat.  Thanks for making sure we knew that.  We hit a LOT of pools and I've NEVER been made to feel that unwelcome.  Hey Bare, we may be older, but we buy a lot of drinks.  Hard Rock got that money and they don't charge to get in during the week."
0,"This review refers to the afternoon tea service only. \n\nMy husband is English and so I cajoled him into trying the cream tea here one afternoon. The service was incredibly friendly, so I feel pretty much like the devil to have to do this, but...\n\nThe sandwiches were stale, with that horrible \""old crust\"" feeling. The scones weren't fresh, but reheated in a microwave. The clotted cream was more like whipped cream. The cakes were still frozen in the middle, making it pathetically obvious that the chef just lopped them off a larger block of ordered-in cake taken straight from the walk-in fridge. Thank goodness they had PG Tips tea to somewhat redeem this entire offering.\n\nHow can a place that calls itself \""quintessentially British\"" pass this stuff off to their customers? I felt embarrassed for the waiter, who, being English, must know full-well how off everything is. Or is the whole kitchen quietly laughing to themselves, \""Silly Americans! They'll eat anything if we tell them it's authentic!\""\n\nThe kicker to the whole thing was that the price for this cream tea, $18, was a per-person cost, not per couple as I'd (stupidly) assumed. Thirty-six dollars for that big of a disappointment bums me out even now, four days later. \n\nWe'll be sticking to having tea time at our house, where the bread hasn't been sitting out on the counter all day."
1,"First time I have been to this establishment.  The food is very delicious.  You can order a la carte, however there's an all you can eat option for $22 where everything on the menu is available for all you can eat.  All the sushi is made fresh behind the sushi bar, none of it is pre-made.  The value of it is phenomenal and there is a large variety of choices.  I went for a lot of sushi choices that I never seen at other sushi restaurants.  Items I ate were the following: seaweed salad, sunomono salad w/ tako, BBQ Salmon roll, Hot & Sexy Cajun roll, Japanese Lasagna Roll, Supreme Albacore roll, Volcano Roll and ice cream (small scoop of all 4 flavors they offer) for dessert.  Keep in mind all those items are part of the all you can eat, all that food for $22... a great value and it all tasted very good.  \n\nThe environment is very pleasant.  You have the option of sitting at a table or sitting at the counter in front of the sushi bar so you can watch them make your order.\n\nThe people were very friendly and were quick to clear the empty dishes I created so I had more space.  Also when I was finished she asked if I wanted any dessert and I was glad to go for the ice cream.  I never really tried any of the four flavors they offered so I asked if I could get a small scoop of each and she was happy to do it.  \n\nI highly recommend this place and am intending to revisit this place before I leave Vegas to head back home to LA.  Now I have to find a place like this in LA that is hopefully near where I live."
1,Good sports bar. Love the wings but be careful. Hot is really hot! Good burgers and fries. Would like more craft beers but they seem to prefer the basics. The focaccia sate awesome. This has become our go to sports bar.

0,"This review is for the UA reps at McCarran who lack customer service and resolution management skills. They managed to turn a relatively benign situation into something ridiculous.\n\nUpon picking up my suitcase I noticed a big dent and hole in my suitcase. My husband is desperate to get to MGM because he has UFC tickets that start in a few hours and I piss him off by going to the baggage claim office to show the rep what happened to my suitcase. I spoke to Charlene Lasoz. Our conversation goes like this:\n\nMe: \""My suitcase is damaged. There is a big dent in the top that was not there before.\""\n\nMs. Lasoz: \""You're right it looks damaged, we can get that fixed for you. Do you live in Las Vegas?\"" Shocked as I was expecting a there's nothing I can do, but doesn't hurt to try.\n\nMe: \""No, I live in San Francisco\""\n\nMs. Lasoz: \""Are any of the contents damaged?\""\n\nMe: \""No, I don't think so.\"" I opened the suitcase to confirm.\n\nMs. Lasoz: After I close it and stand it upright she starts hitting the dent real hard and somewhat flattens the dent out. \"" Oh it's fine, it did what it's supposed to do by protecting your belongings.\""\n\nMe: \""So, you're not going to fix the suitcase?\"" Shocked that she thinks by flattening the dent that is fixing the suitcase.\n\nMs. Lasoz: \""No, the suitcase is not damaged.\""\n\nMe: \""Fine, I'm going to file a complaint, let me please have your name and the 1800 customer service number.\"" If she had just said no in the first place rather than flip flopping on the issue I wouldn't have gotten upset.\n\nA few days later I'm back at the airport and have to pay a $25 check bag fee. I had no problem paying it the first time, but don't feel like paying it again due to UA damaging my suitcase. I pay the fee at the kiosk and talk to the guy taking the luggage. I told him what happened on my previous flight.\n\nMe: \""Is there any way to waive the fee because on my way here my luggage was damaged?\""\n\nLuggage Taker:  \""Let me get a manager\""\n\nMy husband is embarrassed because he said the luggage taker was muttering FU under his breath at me. I spoke to a man named Mr. Aquino and told him what happened including my conversation with Ms. Lasoz.\n\nMe: \""Is there any way to waive the baggage fee since my luggage got damaged in transit?\""  I accepted my repair claim was denied and was going to file a complaint.  I was not asking for a repair since I knew it should be handled by a different department.\n\nMr. Aquino: \""There is no way to waive the fee, but I see your luggage is damaged if you go to the baggage claim department then you can get it fixed.\""\n\nMe: \""Great, where is the baggage claim department.\""\n \nMr. Aquino: \""It is across the street.\""\n\nMe: Being poor with directions. \""Can someone please escort me there?\""\n\nMr. Aquino: \""No, but it is right across from carousel #13\""\n\nMe: Realizing I was already there \""Okay, if I go there can I tell them that you said that my baggage would be fixed since Ms. Lasoz said they could not do anything about it.  What is your name so I can tell the baggage claim person that you said it was okay to be fixed\""  I found his name by glancing at his name tag as he didn't want to tell me.\n\nMr. Aquino: \""No, I did not say that.\""\n\nMe: \""Yes, you did, you said it could be fixed\""  Getting upset and raising my voice.\n\nMr. Aquino: Raising his voice at me \""I did not, you are putting words in my mouth.\""\n\nMe: \""Yes, you did\""  Later I realized he probably meant fix my issue not the bag and was trying to push the problem to another department.  I was upset and raising my voice at this point indignant at implying I was a liar.\n\nMr. Aquino: Walking away from me in disgust \""I am not taking your baggage and getting a Supervisor.\""\n\nAt this point my husband is mortified. A supervisor comes out, forgetting to get a name I will call him Tall Portly Caucasian Man TPCM.\n\nI tell TPCM the story for the 3rd time as I had already told it to the luggage taker and Mr. Aquino. I showed TPCM my luggage and how it was damaged in transit to Las Vegas. TPCM agreed there was damage.\n\nTPCM: \""We cannot waive the $25 bag check fee, but I can see the luggage has been damaged, did you file a claim?\""\n\nMe: \""Ms. Lasoz said there was no damage and did not file a claim for me. I did not stick around because my husband had UFC tickets. I told her I would file a complaint and left.\"" I still am not asking for a repair. I just wanted to waive the baggage fee and a simple no would've sufficed.\n\nAt this point a buxom African American lady came out and told me it was a manufacturer defect of the suitcase and UA had no responsibility for the damage. She did not hear any of my story nor the fact I did not ask for a baggage repair. Not feeling like telling the story again, I tell her I'm filing a complaint about the way this was handled. \n\nIf they had told me no I would've been fine.  Don't waste my time by having to repeat my story multiple times and aggravate the situation by bringing up repairs and then denying repairs.  In hindsight what happened was comical."
0,"Good stuff:\nIf you check in online you can get in very quickly\n\n\nBad stuff:\nWARNING\nI took my 3 year old daughter here for a strange, raspy cough, she had for a week.  I have 5 children, and usually can tell when something needs to be treated. The diagnosis was allergies and I was told to use a humidifier. No strep test, the attending nurse was not able to answer questions, and could not understand observations. 2 days later my daughter was diagnosed with strep.\n\nFacility has high employee turnover (every 3 months all new people, this is the second time this year).\n\nDo not bring your children here.\n\nFast but deadly."
1,"My boyfriend and I stopped here on our way back home for some highly touted Italian food.\nBecause we didn't want to stay for an hour, I ordered a slice of cheese pizza and he got Dave's Famous Lasagna. Both came out steaming hot- and really good. The pizza is traditional thin crust and very crispy. I liked my slice, and my boyfriend said he liked his Lasagna, which was 8$ and some cents for a really good portion and a big slice of garlic bread. The slice of pizza was 2.45$, and then we got Tiramasu  for dessert (they only have that and Cheesecake, no Cannolis :( ) which was good, but they gave it to us still partially frozen- not bad, but I would prefer it not frozen.\nAll in all it was pretty decent meal for a fair price."
1,"We hit Hula's on a Friday evening to grab dinner and a drink. The restaurant is just a ways from the light rail so, from a convenience standpoint, this is a plus. We had a couple themed mixed drinks and, like others have said, they don't skimp on the booze. It was raining so the bar area was very crowded but props to the bartender for finding us and providing consistent service.\n\nNot much to be said for the happy hour specials but Hula's isn't about $2 Coronas anyways so plan on having something mixed off the menu."
0,"I've came here several times and EVERY TIME its not dusted, washed and vacuumed all the way! and their slow. \nSeriously, its waste of your money. I get so annoyed when they come by where I work to sell coupons. I tell them their services are not worth my money."
0,"Just checked in 2 hours ago - shocked \nRoom smells like old old house, windows so dirty so we will keep the curtains closed this time.\n\nWe ordered room service, the food arrived 45 minutes later, cold. I decided to call Room Service, before I could say anything the lady on the other line said that she wants cash and if we are not paying cash the food will be taking away, she was super rude and didn't let me say a word. I asked her to charge this bill to our room.\n\nA half  hour later got a visit from 3 huge security guys that claimed we didn't want to pay the bill, they were talking about jail. Completely overreacting to a non exciting problem.  \n\nthis is just 3 first hour.. I'm scared\n \n\n+ The internet connection is terrible.\n\nNew York New York NEVER AGAIN!!"
0,"Spent $26 for a Bacon Cheeseburger with fries/soda\nAlso ordered 8 wings, 4 hot and 4 molasses Bbq.\nThe wings were essentially fried with no seasonings and then drenched in mediocre sauce. Huge disappointment since they looked so tasty on the pic. They were not finished.\nThe burger was bleh, I ate almost half. I ordered it medium, I received instead a huge overcooked and unseasoned patty, with tasteless cheddar and old red onions. Fries were yuck, I mean how do you mess up fries? Well they did.\nThe soda was the best thing we ordered.\nDo not come here of your expecting a good meal."
0,"Here is my Email to Outside Inn on Charleston, and Groupon, that describes our experience.\n\nWhat a disappointment.  We thought your on-line menu offered several desirable dishes.  What a disappointment when the menu at the restaurant (really just a tavern) was totally different and did not offer the dish my wife desired.  Our waiter then gives us a story about \""the on-line menu was from another restaurant\"", which we all know was just that, a story.  I take my wife out to celebrate her birthday and then get embarrassed over this!  I thought Bait-and-Switch marketing was outlawed many years ago.  What a disappointment.\n\nFYI - Their domain name mixednutslv.com expired on 10/06/2011, two days after our visit, and is still pending renewal or deletion.  It looks like they may be going out of business."
1,I had let my yard go and needed some work done to get it back in shape. Adrian did just that and more for a good price.  He did such a good job that I have them come every two weeks now.
0,"Popped in to check out the happy hour specials.  The drink was pretty good, pineapple and tequila.  The guacamole and fresh chips were great too but the bartender sucked.  Super unfriendly, uninterested and a total dud.  The HH specials are nothing special, not cheap.  Very limited menu items.  Super disappointing.  Too bad because location is prime and it's a pretty space."
1,"Hotel is all suites, which is perfect for families - we stayed here for a week long trip in June 2011.  Employees were all very nice and pleasant.  We ate breakfast each morning, was great with the exception of the pancakes - a bit small frisbee like.\n\nRoom was clean and spacious, air-conditioner worked great, and it was very quiet (except for our own room - a 3 year old little girl - ouch!)  Only complaint was the furniture - couch and chair - really could be more comfortable and stylish.\n\nOver-all, was a great stay - we'll go back."
0,"You want to stay in a hotel with ghetto clientelle then the Luxor is the place. No good looking men, neighbors smoking pot all night, cockroach in our room, room service quick and good at 3am, but too far from all the actions.\n\nAlso, most of the pool is closed for reconstruction along with Club Ra so there is really nothing to do while there...must stand in line and take a cab to another hotel. Stay somewhere else, that's my advice."
0,"I really like the vibe at Next, and the cubano coffee drink is delicious.\n\nBut my experience with their sandwiches sadly takes the top three stars off my review.\n\nI have eaten the sandwiches three times.  Once I had the \""tiny tuna,\"" some tuna on a roll about the size of an English muffin, for $4.95.  I also tried the BBQ chicken sandwich and the turkey burger, both the size of a six-inch sub, for $9.95.  The tuna was very plain, with just some soft mixed greens on the sandwich.  The meat on the BBQ chicken sandwich was kind of rubbery, and the bottom piece of bread was completely drenched into mushiness from the coleslaw on the sandwich (which seems to be added when the sandwich is prepared at the beginning of the day for the display case, and simply taken out and heated for a few minutes when someone orders a sandwich.)  The turkey burger was dry and without much flavor.\n\nThey were not terrible sandwiches, but for the price, especially the larger ones are entirely not worth it.  For $10 I expect a restaurant-style sandwich, with flavor, and maybe a better side than the cheap tortilla chips they serve with it.\n\nI am not a normally negative reviewer, you can see if you look at my other reviews.  And I worked in the restaurant industry for four years, so I understand the struggles and I try not to be super-picky about my food and its quality.  But, I went to Next three different times and didn't like a single thing I ate.  So I figure I should at least warn other visitors not to drop ten bucks on a sandwich there.\n\nSorry Next!  Let me know if you improve things and I will come try again!"
0,"Went through the Drive-thru today at about 11:15 am for lunch. Ordered the habanero quarter pounders and a caramel sundae. Sundae machine was down, so no sundae. I should have taken that as an omen and just left. Got the promo to buy a quarter pounder & get one free. When I went to eat my sandwich I had to search for the habanero sauce( just a touch was on the bun), and the burger was dry as hell and tasted like it had been reheated from the day before. I took one bite and could barely chew it. I threw them both away. What a waste of gas and time. Never going to this place again ...  AWFUL"
1,I can guarantee you that you will be satisfied with your haircut if you go here. When I moved here I tried multiple barbers and no one could consistently get my haircut right.\nAt who's next I can go in and have the piece of mind that no matter which barber cuts my hair they will take their time and do it right ! I use the jcrew hair products and it's hard to find that stuff at a good price and they always have it in stock. I now call ahead to make and appt. and request Alex he is the best. Atmosphere wise it is good also they have flat screen tvs for each chair and a big flat screen on the wall.You can go to the barbershop watch the game and have good conversation with the customers and even have a beer which reminds me of back home! Don't waste your money anywhere else and go check this place out - I don't normally write reviews but this place is well deserving of one
0,"I hate Olive Garden. It makes me laugh when they ask \""how is everything?\""  I wonder what goes through their minds when I say \""The microwave did an awesome job\"".

1,"I had dinner and drinks at \""The Upton\"" in Scottsdale last night. A very cool spot that had been the \""Petite  Maison for years ( near Scottsdale road and Camelback).  The food was awesome.

Amazing\n\nFinally... The staff was awesome. Truly \""on top of it\"" and great to talk to as well. \n\nI recommend this to anyone that wants great food, amazing house music and not to have 40 TV's dominating the agenda with raucous sports fans yelling.

1,Hugh store with everything you could possibly want. Very friendly staff and the best prices in town.
0,"I used to come here often when I was married and lived in the area, my husband and I loved to play pool here with friends.  I don't know if I was looking at life through rose colored glasses back then but the Hidden House seemed so much more pleasing than it does today.  \n\nI live in the east valley and my friend lives in the west valley so when he wanted to meet up to shoot some pool I recommended the Hidden House.  When I opened the door I thought \""oh shit, this was a mistake.\""  The place just looks sad inside, like where people go when they need to cry in their beer or contemplate suicide."

0,"Went to their new location this evening. Had a difficult time finding parking first of all. We walked in and there was blaring club music. Very loud part hip hop songs playing which was totally odd. The decor was all modern compared to the southwestern and homey style of their previous location. First they sat us at a oddly long table to where we had to sit next to each other and hope no one was seated at the bar stool next to us. We asked to be seated elsewhere because it was not comfortable to sit there. We ordered the fried okra, whipped potatoes, potato salad and two cornbreads (she placed them on the table and left and we were left with no silverware) came out about a good 5-8 min before our main dish arrived. The sides were blah and our waffles were soggy. Nothing like the old lolo's. Very very disappointed in the whole experience. Loud music, decor doesn't go with lolo's theme, and the food sucked. They get one star for the mason jars."
1,Stopped to check out this place.  Ordered a dinner special and some sushi rolls.  Staff and service was very friendly and welcoming.  Will come back again with kids!
0,"So here's my account of a hobby shop that truly needs to  reassess their core values. I walked into this store before they were even opened on Father's Day weekend. \n\nHow we found the store was through searching online for a DJI distributor in Vegas. I find that people who buy DJI products really need guidance on usage and training hence why we were looking for a store front to stop by and ask questions. All we could find was USHobby shop, turns out they are just an online store and Drones Plus is their store front that was to be opened a few weeks later.\n\nWell, my father and I walked into to what we thought would be a pleasant experience. Most hobby store experiences are welcoming. To our dismay we were greeted by the owner, Mike, who stroked his own ego almost every 5 minutes. He came off as arrogant, unfriendly, and quite frankly rude. He told us how he was the head of Sales and how he knew everything about DJI products.\n\nI came in for two reasons: one was to ask about why one of my motors seems to have different resistance than the other three to which Mike just told me to buy a new motor and wasn't interested in helping diagnose the problem. His tech guy also had no answers for me... all he said was \""umm... you should be fine as long as it doesn't make any weird sound\"". Secondly, I was interested in extending the range of my Phantom vision+ to which Mike replied \""Why would you want to do that?\"" And brushed the question off. He kept trying to rush us out the door.\n\nI understand they were a week shy of their grand opening, however there was no need for their \""head of sales\"" to be rude to potential customers. Talk about terrible people skills, not sure he has ever had a job in sales considering how he treated us. He was very condescending in almost every response he gave us and made us feel extremely uncomfortable.\n\nWorst part of all... a few weeks later my motor failed, thankfully it failed during pre flight testing and not 100 ft up. I hope another store opens up in Vegas soon because I wouldn't ever come back so long as Mike is running sales. Future hobbyists beware!"
0,"Eric's got some points.  I'm sure it is good for Campustown to have more stores, but it's somewhat nauseating to have left prepackaged hipsterdom on the West Coast (and legit hipsterness as well), only to run smack into its most bottom line corporate cousin 2,000 miles away.\n\nIt's terrifyingly expensive and annoyingly mass marketed.  I like many of the things in UO, but I'm not buying them for $50 when I could find them other places for $5.  And when they have all the soul and uniqueness of a suburban mini-mansion."
1,"Great Happy Hour specials, tasty appetizers and fab Margaritas! \n\nThe Pink Taco's regular menu is a little pricey for Mexican grub but try the happy hour The house Margaritas are 2-4-1 and absoulutly fabulous! The happy hour appetizer menu is ample and filling enough for dinner. We had the sampler plate are were not disappointed. The ambiance was great. We were sitting at the bar and the staff was very friendly, chatty and attentive. If you stick to the specials or split an entree (they are big enough for two to share) the Pink Taco can be a good dining value."
0,"We had problems with the Tropicana since before even arriving and checking in at the hotel. I booked a renovated suite months in advance, luckily I called a few days before checking in to add a name to the reservation- my reservation was still in the computer system, however it was \""canceled\"". How could my reservation be canceled when I am receiving biweekly confirmation emails since April? \nAs an apology for the 'glitch' I was promised the exact same reservation for the same price I booked the room for. \nSo, come check in day my girl-fiend arrives a few hours before the rest of us and they made her pay for the entire 4 night stay, in full, in advance. When I called to ask why they couldn't just use the card they had on file for the deposit I was told that I should have known that whoever checks in first had to pay up front (BTW, no one else we talked to that weekend were required to do so- guess we just look sketchy?). \nAfter checking in my friend had to walk through the construction zone they are calling a resort to arrive at a room that was not only unrenovated, but also one that sells for a much lower rate then what she JUST paid in full. \nAfter a long and painful conversation with the lady at the front desk, my husband managed to get them to \""find\"" the last available suite and have it held for us. We were actually told that our friend had better hurry and go down to the desk to check into the correct suite so that someone else didn't check into it. Sounds like terrific customer service to me! We arrived at the hotel as my friend calls me to let me know that they did move her.. to a DIRTY renovated suite! \nAt this point the concierge, Richard (who was actually very nice) came up the room and personally apologized for all the mix ups and comped the last night of our stay. I personally thought we should have been offered a bit more then that- but hey, things were looking up. \nThe next day we checked in at our cabana and while it is not the most lavish experience, it was certainly worth the $150 bucks (iced towels, free sodas/water, a decent fruit tray, and a very nice lady named Rachael that took care of anything we needed), but of course the day could not go without at least one hassle. Because they made us pay for our room upfront we were completely unable to charge anything to the room including our cabana. \nThe next day we had reserved chairs (we were told that it was limited to 5) on the pool island, which was very nice with all the same amenities as the cabana rental, however as soon as we were relaxing and enjoying ourselves a group 3-5 adults and 3 children were allowed to move our stuff out of the way and take over the island. \nWe couldn't easily get to our things, they let their kids wet our bags, and we ended up being the monkey in the middle in their game of catch. When we, rightfully, complained we were told that they were friends of the management. \nWe stayed at the Tropicana to save a little dough, but it was most definitely no inexpensive enough to be treated so poorly. In the end we still had an enjoyable Vegas trip, but it was in no part thanks to the Tropicana. The only people I recommend staying there are people who are close personal friends with the lower management, because it seems that they can do what ever they want."
0,"Went here with my family.  The corn maze was okay.  I was told they used to have people hide in the corn stalks and jump out at you.  They no longer do that so you are basically trying to find your way out.  Entrance is same as the exit so it isn't hard.  We just winged it and you can't get lost.\n\nArea with haunts is interesting.  They have random \""monsters\"" walking around like a guy with a chain saw and a dead guy with a shopping cart with body parts.  They have a rule they cannot touch or talk to you or they'll get fired.\n\nWouldn't suggest bringing an 8 year old.  My cousin brought his 8 and 12 year old daughters and they were so scared within the first 20 feet that they were crying and wouldn't even walk through to the exit.  My Aunty had to walk them around the outside and wait in the car with them.\n\nMy other cousin's 14 year old was also freaked out but I calmed her down enough to go through one of the haunts.  The haunt was okay.  You just walk through corn and there are different settings with people to hassle you.  For instance there was a classroom with a scary teacher.  They did have little kids working which I thought was disturbing on a moral level.  They will pick on people who look scared so they were always in my cousin's daughter's face and left me alone.  \n\nMy cousin went through a different haunt and said they screamed once and the rest was lame.  \n\nOverall way too overpriced.  They definitely should let you buy single haunts instead of forcing you to buy all 5.  \n\nGo on the website to print $2 off coupon."

1,"Went to this spot on a recommendation from my boss.  Even though it's far from downtown, it's open 24 hours and getting their smoked meat platter and special Jarry poutine, it's to die for.  My only gripe is that it looks dated and the coleslaw I had wasn't too great but that a pretty minor, will hit this place up more often when I visit Montreal."
1,"A cute little spot with very eclectic dishware. Our food was served in 2 Pyrex dishes, on a square plate, and on a round flowery grandma-esque plate. Nothing wrong with that, but just worth noting.\n\nAs for the food:\n\n-Hot and sour soup: nice and spicy, strong sour notes, and big enough for four or more.\n-Fish in chili oil: good ma-la character, lots of chili oil, and some surprise glass noodles in the bottom of the dish. Worth ordering for sure.\n-Family style tofu: a nice dish of tofu and wood ear fungus in a mildly spicy sauce. Tasty and abundant.\n-Spicy green beans: definitely some spicy kick, they were cooked just the way I like them. Very enjoyable.\n\nThe menu has some translation issues - I did see some white folks order \""beef stripes\"" assuming they meant beef strips, when it was actually beef tripe. But I think you have to expect that when you're at any Chinese restaurant in Montreal."

0,Thas was absolutely horrible.  The table cloth was dirty.  The buffet was small and not very appetizing looking.  The bathroom was moldy.  Stay away!

1,"Ask for Ben. He was a phenomenal server. Gave great recommendations, was funny, and very knowledgeable. We started with the pretzel fondue and it was awesome. The pretzels were nice and warm, very chewy (in a good way) and the cheese was delicious. For dinner we ordered the Union Steak Burger with truffle fries and the Caprese Melt with sea salt fries. My husband said the steak burger was \""scrumptious\"" and the truffle fries were \""solid\"". I enjoyed my Caprese Melt and the fries were great. \n\nI also ordered a Moscow Mule. When he delivered my drink in a traditional low ball glass, I was disappointed at the lack of a copper mug. Ben said to give him a minute and about 10 minutes later, just in time for my second round, he magically had a copper mug. Truth be told, he actually had his mom run down to the restaurant and bring his personal copper mug down for me. \n\nI was blown away by his service and will definitely be back. Thanks for making our night Ben!"
0,Blah. Mediocrity at it's best.
1,"Very impressed, first time there and they had some extraordinary Art especially the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies by Yayoi Kusama ... that was worth the price of entry alone.\nNice to have Arcadia Farms there too."
1,"I stop by Whitfill Nursery several times a year.  They have an excellent general selection of trees, shrubs, ground covers, cacti, and succulents of all sizes, many adapted to our Sonoran Desert environment.\n\nThey also sell lady bugs and praying mantis egg cases for insect control.  If you don't keep habitat for ladybugs and manti, you will lose them, but you can always return here for more.  \n\nOn my most recent stop, I found they offer landscape design services.\n\nIf you purchase trees, walk among the rows and pick the ones you want in your landscape.\n\nI seem to purchase at least two plants each time I visit. No plants I have purchased have died after transplanting."
1,"If you are more than just a music consumer--that is, if you really really love music--than you must be present at the Montreal International Jazz Festival at least once in your life.  Now, don't get hung up on the word Jazz.  This festival--billed as the world's largest of its kind--brings multiple forms of eclectic music from artists from around the world into a 4 block space on the North American continent for two full weeks.  The official tour guide puts it like this, \""...from artists who recorded 78s to artists of the mp3 era, they come from every part of the globe to show us how music transcends generations and boundaries.\""  I should also point out here that if you are an uncompromising jazz purist, you will either be compelled to broaden your horizons or you will leave the event feeling like the dinosaurs did just before the extinction level event that brought on human domination of the planet.\n\nThe people who put on this event have been at it for more than 30 years, so they know what they are doing.  Every year for two weeks from late June to early July, they bring to the streets, stages and art venues of Montreal approximately 3000 artists from 30 countries.  Incredibly, a large portion of these shows are absolutely free!  And, when it's 105 degrees on the US East Coast, it's a very comfortable 80-85 degrees in Montreal.  It's very feasible to have a great time just walking around the many outdoor stages and have a good time and spend very little money if any at all.  And when you get tired or hungry, you can grab a spot at one of the many pubs or bistros that ring the area and do some people watching while still being a part of the show via well placed speakers and monitors of the various stages.  And yep, there's an app for iPhone and Google so you always know who's playing where.\n\nI could write forever about all of the great things about this music festival.  But instead, I will ask you to just Google it and check out their website, where the paid writers can give better justice than I can.\n\nOh...did I mention that the Montreal International Jazz fest happens to take place in...you guessed it...Montreal?  So if the impossible happens, and you get tired of the festival, you can explore one of the coolest cities in North America.  Cars are not necessary."
1,"Roast pig ftw! Crab puffs and bbq duck are happiness in mouth. Never want to leave Lee x2. Pickled veggies, so good. I am not original : - ("
0,"What a disappointment. We began our late night (9:30) dinning experience here really happy with high expectations as the ambiance was wonderful and the recommendations were good. However, we left bitter and disappointed. My sister and I enjoyed two lovely \""small plates\"" one was beef skewers and the other a shrimp bruschetta type dish. It was all down hill after that. Shortly after ordering our main courses we noticed a bug crawling on the top of our booth...yeah, it was a COCKROACH!!! I grabbed it in my napkin and crumpled it up and left in a side station area. We both were grossed out but were not going to make a huge fuss and have it ruin our meal. We're both flexible and understanding and didn't complain. But seeing that in a restaurant is really inexcusable and disgusting-and definitely dampers your appetite for their food. Where are his friends? Are they in the kitchen?! YUCK!!! We then waited 45 minutes for our food: an enchilada plate and a relleno plate. When they set down the steaming hot plates the food was cooked to nuclear levels because there  was a one inch crust around the plate and the beans were so dried out it was comical. Now mind you, these are $16 and $18 dollar plates of food. That is borderline fine dinning pricing and should come out looking as such. We promptly sent the food back and the manager came out and apologized which was appreciated. He stated that \""it was inexcusable the way the food came out (which our server didn't monitor) and that his cook is obviously more interested in cleaning and getting out of here, then preparing the food.\"" They offered to remake the food but it was literally too late around 10:45 and we didn't want to wait. They then took the food off but left the other stuff on. The bill came out to around 42 dollars. Which seemed unreasonable after only having a beer, a cocktail, two appetizers and a totally ruined dinning experience. We didn't mention the cockroach or the fact that it was my 30th birthday to the manager but it boils down to this: after that kind of experience he could of saved our business by comping the meal. The fact that we had TWO ruined entrees and walked out of their still hungry AND paying 40 dollars is bullshit. There are too many other quality options in this town with exceptional service. I wont ever go back to Rokerij."
0,"My husband, brother-in-law, mother and I all stayed at the Nobu Hotel last weekend (10/5/13 thru 10/8/13). We splurged a little and payed for the limo service ($65.00 one way). Our luggage arrived about an hour before we got to Las Vegas. After we realized where the luggage was stored, we noticed there was no limo driver in sight. The hotel did call me and send another limo right away. Upon arrival to the hotel, we were escorted by Nobu staff to the hotel lobby area. There was very little room in the small check in area. Since we arrived early, none if our rooms were ready. We had to wait about five hours until A room was ready. I asked ahead if time if all our party could be on the same floor. They FINALLY achieved this request but with a lot of persistence from me. \n\nThe rooms were pretty nice and looked just like the pictures on this and the hotel web site. There was NO welcome tea in the room. I, once again, had to request it. Needless to say, the hotel is in a very central location in Cesear's Palace. But due to all the minor issues, I will not be staying here again in the future. I prefer the Palazzo (Prestige) much more!"
0,"My haircut was OK.  I got no water, no scalp or neck massage.  My hairdresser, Charles, left me more than once to do consultations on other clients.  I felt like he rushed my haircut, because I think he had another client booked too close to my appointment time.  He also frequently turned away to socialize with coworkers.  The salon was dirty and a little bit shabby.  $93 before tax/tip for a trim.  I will not go back."
0,"Really, $9 for a pint of PBR and $6 for a bottle of Miller lite! That right there should be warning on how overpriced the beers are at this joint. I get that it's located in the luxurious Aria hotel but charging almost triple the price on cheap american beer is insane. Hell I cant get a Belgium Delerium Tremens for $8 at most places, why is it $16 here. It's almost cheaper to play $20 at a 25\u00a2 Video Poker machine and get two comp beers."
1,I love this jewelry store! Have been dealing with them for years when we lived around the corner from them.  We have moved up to Cave Creek and I make the trip down to them cause they are worth it.  I've tried other jewelers and they don't meet up to my standards like Treasures does!  Keep up the excellent work!
0,"You would have no idea which show I was referring to if I said I saw it in Las Vegas and it starred a group of fairly attractive women doing dance routines to prerecorded music while topless.  That not only describes \""Sydney After Dark\"", but also current strip shows like \""Fantasy\"", \""X Burlesque\"" and \""Crazy Girls\"".  \n\nAustralian accents aside, there is nothing new being offered here.  As I watched the prerequisite cowgirl scene, I wondered how/why THIS had become the formula for Vegas topless shows?  Maybe having a girl that sings makes it classier than a strip club?  There has to be a more creative way to present half naked girls!  Oh!  They have a girl in a leotard doing an aerial scarves act!  That was so cool and original like 10 years ago but a snoozefest today.  A topless comedian would have been much better.    \n\nKeeping with the Aussie theme, they dance to mostly native artists from the \""lahnn daahn undah\"" like AC/DC, Tina Arena, Sia and INXS.  I can only guess their sultry version of \""Locomotion\"" was inspired by Kylie Minogue.  They even did an aboriginal routine which left me feeling cultured and educated.  That's a lie. \n\nThe few people in attendance (15% capacity at best) were all moved up to the best seats so buy the cheapest ones if you're going to pay.  I would recommend \""Fantasy\"" at Luxor over this.  The girls are hotter!"
0,"Not good.  Fish tacos were over cooked and tough to chew and the only flavor you could taste was the tartar sauce (not good), even the beans were way too salty.  The search for a good fish taco continues."
1,Very good smoothies and bowls!  Fills you up!
1,"Amazing prices, awesome employees, and they fairly purchase your clothing. I always find cute things for cheap prices- I found a shirt their yesterday for $3 and it was adorable! Love the store so much!"
1,"Wendy's tastes like home cooking. It's different than a place like KJ's; this is more of a Shanghai/Hong Kong style, with a little fusion (e.g. tom yum fried rice). \n\nHer restaurant is clean, with very good style for an Asian restaurant. Dish presentations are good as well. And it feels homey here, too, when Wendy comes around to say hello, see how the dishes are. The servers are attentive as well.\n\nGreen beans with XO sauce\nPan fried noodles with XO sauce\nSpicy Chicken\nWonton Noodle soup\n\nAll of these dishes were cooked well and were entirely flavorful. I could eat the green beans everyday, it's that good. They're crunchy with a little bit of a scorch from the wok. The pan fried noodles are rolls of noodles cut into bite sized pieces. Both of these dishes have good XO flavor. I really enjoyed the burnt chili pepper flavor of the spicy chicken, where you cook a dried chili in oil before adding the rest of the ingredients. The wonton noodles aren't mind-blowing by any means, but they hit a certain comfort spot.\n\nIf I think about past dishes I've tried here, the only thing I didn't care for was the dish with the thinner noodles, crab, and XO sauce. I felt the crab to bell pepper ratio was disproportional."
1,Was on my way home and decided to stop off at a Starbucks. I've to this one once before. It's convenient and the gal at the drive-thru window was friendly. Glad to know they appreciate your patronage.a
0,"At one point in time, this was our go to place for great, authentic Mexican food. But, the last few times we've gone, our experience was not so good. The portions have become smaller, the prices higher. See, the problem is the plate is the same size it has always been. And at one time your plate was served to you full. Now the plate is only 1/2 full. We just went last night. Ordered the same two entrees we just about always order. One being the fish tacos, which have always been my favorite. But this time the fish had a funny smell & taste and the rice & beans were pretty much non existent. This place has become the Denny's of Mexican food. And it's all very bland. Sad. We really miss the way it used to be."
1,You can't beat Sunday all day happy hour and live music! They also have music Thursday and Friday ( I think). I recommend going early enough to see the sunset!
1,"Again, one of my favorite meals in vegas.  We had to wait about 40 minutes for a table for two on friday night to get a seat, which is to be expected.  We got about 7 tapas for the two of us.  As many others have stated, get the bacon wrapped stuffed dates, they are very good.  I've been here before and I think I liked the food this time around better.  The other thing with tapas places, I've felt that I'm not getting value for my money typically, but this was $62 including tip for two, and 7 plates and 1 dessert, no drinks (just water).  I thought this was pretty good.  As far as service, it was ok.  I am picky about making sure my drinks are refilled consistently.  I waited a while the first time, and then just asked the server to leave a pitcher of water, so I really didn't have to wait the rest of the meal. Overall, I would recommend checking this place out."
0,I bought a guinea pig from here a couple of months ago. I was so excited because it was my first pet that actually belonged to me. I spent about close to 90 in total for all supplies and the guinea pig. However three days after purchasing the little guy I noticed his ear was peeling with dry skin. IT WAS RINGWORM! I went back to exchange or return him and the sales woman told me that yes he probably had ringworm and that I shouldn't exchange him. She then let me take him home. \n\nI returned him a week later because ringworm is highly contagious and I didn't want my two dogs to catch it. This time the cashier told me that the sales woman shouldn't have even let me take him home and that it is petsmarts fault and responsibility to treat. He told me that he would call me when the guinea pig was fully cured. \n\nBlow in behold a week later I had ringworm on my arm and while I was treating my ringworm the guinea pig was fully cured an ready to pick up. I didn't want to get him though because I didn't want him to catch it again from me this time! \n\nI don't recommend buying guinea pigs from here because the cage was still not clean after I returned my guinea pig. It still had a lot of poop and this was about a 2 week frame. And RINGWORM IS CONTAGIOUS so probably all of the guinea pigs there have it.
0,"I've been to a few tanning salons in town, and while they are all pricey, Body Heat's contract cancellation fee is absolutely ridiculous. A contract is good for 10 months where you're paying 60 a month, and to cancel, its a whopping $200! Really?! As if it's an important association. It's a TANNING salon! Aside from that, its limited to Nevada so its practically impossible to move without practically selling them your lung. In addition, they don't offer other benefits within their contract. I visited another tanning salon where my friend is a member, and to avoid possible thoughts that I'm an employee there, I'm going to keep the name anonymous. Anyway, it's the same price and they treat their \""VIP\"" members with monthly facial red light treatments, hydration stations and water massage beds. To sum my frustration up, as part of the customer service industry, I'm well aware that exemplary customer service is what brings people back to businesses. That being said, being excessively ripped off by Body Heat tanning is enough cause to avoid this place at all costs in the future. Based on previous comments, my disappointment appears to be a shared feeling amongst others."
0,"It's not a gyro house anymore... it's now a soul food shop that also offers gyros as an afterthought. Because they had soul food specials all over the wall, I decided against ordering the gyro. I opted for the philly cheese steak... and well... it came on a hoagie roll - but it probably had close to a half a cup of mayonnaise on it. It was so incredibly disgusting - had to scrape it off in order to eat it."
0,"This Hotel is Great!!!   The employees that work here are all wonderful and friendly. The reason for the 1 star is for the RESORT FEE that has now gone up to $28 a night.\nI go to Las Vegas to gamble... I never use any of the so called amenities that this resort fee covers. (Spa, Gym, Pool, Wi-Fi , etc).  So, why am I being forced to pay for something I don't use???"
0,"Very disappointed.  I used to go to this water park as a teenager.  It was reasonably priced and the lines were also short and fast moving.  Today this park will cost you around $40 per person to get in plus parking.  However by far the worst part are the lines which average about a 45 minute or more wait time. The fast passes are an additional 30 per person,  outrageous!  We were at the park for about 3 1/2 hours and were only able to go down 4 slides because of wait time. This a local water park not Disney land,  I expect much better prices and service!"
1,"Late night cravings? Are you near Chinatown and your usual spots aren't cutting it? This is a solid taco truck that will satisfy your munchies - open late! This is the same place that used to be near the tire shop parking lot on Valley View and Spring Mountain. They just relocated on Valley View towards the north a bit more.\n\nPrices are on par with any other street food Mexican spot. It seems to me most of their food is made to order only because it takes longer than say Tacos el Gordo where it's ready to go. Flavors are solid and quality is high. They have a huge selection of sauces and salsas for every taste.  Everything seems very fresh. Not too greasy, either! I'd say just right. I think they prefer a \""dryer\"" sort of marinade/seasoning on everything.\n\nI've sampled their tacos al carbon as well as their pork burrito. I'd be back for both over and over.  There isn't a lot to say, if you like street tacos and fast Mexican food in general, except keep them in mind next time you're having late night cravings!"
0,This place doesn't deserve the Gordon Ramsay name. Very average at best. Waiters talk way too much.  Food is just chain restaurant quality.  Ambiance is non-existent.  And the prices are ridiculously high.
0,"Let me start by saying WORST CUPCAKES EVER!  Seriously.  I'm not trying to be mean, but they were really the worst cupcakes I've ever eaten.  First of all they looked very unprofessional, I seriously think my 7 year old grand daughter could have baked and decorated better cupcakes!  The taste was very bland, poorly decorated and just plain BORING!  Don't waste your money on this crap.  Girls... maybe you should take up watching CUPCAKES WARS or take a professional baking class... just a thought.  Needless to say I will NEVER eat these again and NEVER recommend them! OVER PRICED AND DULL!"
1,"The gardens themselves are lovely. A nice little oasis in the desert. We saw multiple bunnies & chipmunks. Theres a dogpark in this area too only drawback is if you dont know its there, youll never find it. Id rate this area a 5.\n\nThe playground was just average - a 3. \n\nAveraged together you get a 4.  \n\nA nice place to play with the kids or the dogs."
1,"This is by far the best best burger place in town. It definitely beats \""the works\"". They cook the burger to your liking and the menu options are awesome. Great place and great hangout atmosphere."
0,"Went here on good reviews and the fact that this is an institution in Las Vegas. Been around since the 70's. I got the famous western with vanilla custard. \nI did not enjoy this place as much as the other frozen custard places in Vegas. Believe me I love frozen custard, just not luv it custard. The vanilla tasted artificial and the sundae was way to sweet for my taste. I love frozen custard and I was hoping that it was gonna be really good but was a disappointment to me. At least I can say I tried it."
0,Worst flight experience ever.  Traveling with three small children and closed the door on us for our connecting flight because they had re routed us without telling us assuming we were not making our connecting flight which we ran to and arrived at in time.  Customer service may as well close up since they are just faces who can't do anything but admit we were right but they are powerless. Same with 1-800 #.  Don't waste your money flying this airline.
1,"Very expensive at $50 per person but good food and good service. There can be a long wait so if you are in a rush, the buffet may not be the best spot. \n\nFood: 4\nService (including wait): 3\nTotal: 3.5 rounds up"
1,Great local gaming bar. Plenty of seating and pool tables if the machines take your money though. Just hit 4 Aces with the kicker a few nights ago and always get great service from Stevo. \n\nSeparate restaurant for non smokers and a digital juke box makes Remedy's one of my favorite spots. Actually partied here on Christmas and they made a great ham with all the fixings.
1,"You want Italian? You're no where near New York? Go to grimaldis. NY pizza at its  finest. Great service, great food, great venue. Thank you!!"
0,Gross gross gross!!!!!!\n\nI am never going back. Went on Saturday and had a horrendous experience. First off the line at the bar is awful! Easily spent 20 mins trying to get a drink. But the worst part was heading back to the pool and hearing That a guy sharted and vomited inside the pool. Gross! Management did nothing to get everyone out of the pool. You could see vomit chunks floating around. Runaway before its too late.\n\nGROSS!!!!
1,"I'm no beer conossieur, but I enjoy this place because of the wide array options on tap. So fantastic. The food is pretty good too. I enjoyed the parmesan crusted chicken, while my girl had the garlic noodle appetizer. The portions were large and we were full after that and a few beers. My girl loves cider and enjoy the raspberry Wyders that's on tap. We were here for a friend's birthday party, so our group was pretty large. The service was lacking and they were slow to bring our drinks, food and checks towards the end, but all in all they were able to acommodate our very large group. I'll definitely be back, with a smaller group.  The weekends get pretty busy, so expect a wait for larger parties."
1,"I came here with my little godson and cousins for the free holiday ornament-making event on a recent Saturday afternoon.  I can't believe it's taken me so long to visit this local, unique Las Vegas gem.  The ornament-making actually took place outside at the Neon Boneyard park, across the street from the museum.  There were staff from the Neon Museum on hand to show us how to make the paper ornaments, as well as provide all the supplies:  paper, glue, glitter, stickers, markers.  The kids and adults had fun being crafty together.  With the event starting at 3:00pm, we hung out and socialized until 5:00pm, when we were allowed free entry into the Neon Museum for complimentary hot chocolate and listen to Christmas carols sung by a group of students from Las Vegas Academy.  Part of the Neon Museum was open as well, so we were able to walk around and see some of the signs lit up at night (see pictures).  It was an excellent opportunity to see some of the site and introduce my cousins to the museum, too.  We all want to come back soon for the night tour, $25 regular price, $22 for locals and students, free for kids 6 and under.  I hope they have this event next Christmas!"
0,"Possibly the worst experience I have had at a restaurant. Our wait or disappeared mid dinner and we had to ask to get served again. The sushi is dull. They played rap songs. Waited 20 minutes for our check after we have it to the waitress. We ordered 2 rolls and was charged for 3, a ten dollar roll was the roll added on. Extremely hipster and not authentic sushi."
0,"This is an update to my original post.  I guess the management didn't like an honest review. There were also some other reviews on here that were a little more honest but they were deleted too. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you Joking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nIf this is local Las Vegas at its best, I'll pass thanks.\n\nI ate at Vox on Saturday August 16th at 8:20ish PM and I have to tell you that it was awful. \n\nFirst we were sat in the dining room (all but empty) that clearly didn't fit the concept. It was like they were trying to be country club-ish with the big chairs and all the wood but the service, food, and remainder of the atmosphere didn't fit. To top off the bad vibe they were setting up live music during our entire dinner. This means the lights guy was flashing the test lighting in my wifes face all night. Nothing like a blinding spotlight of varying shades to distract you from your dinner. I would have told the manger but didn't see one the entire evening. The hostess might have warned us about the live music, it's always nice to know when a band is going to warm up during your meal.\n\nTo the owners: The chairs do not fit the tables. Short chairs make for an uncomfortable dining experience and make you feel like a little kid at the adults table.\n\nService: Not entirely bad, a little slow and not very well coordinated but not terrible. One thing though, don't refer to a man and his wife as ladies and gentlemen. Neither I nor my wife are two people requiring a plural description. Also it should have been your recommendations not your recommends. You have a recommendation not a recommends!!! Other than that not bad. Wine service was normal and proper.\n\nFood: Are you Joking?????!!!!\n\nApps: Shrimp Cocktail, Cheese and Charcuterie\nEntrees: Seared Ahi, New York Steak\n\nThe shrimp was pedestrian at best. It wasn't bad but nothing I haven't seen a million times before.\nThe cheese and charcuterie plate was laughable. First there was no actual charcuterie on the plate just some thick cut cured ham. Since no one told us what it was we'll assume it was prosciutto though it could have been serrano, either way it was to thick to enjoy. It was paired with some cheeses that, again, were not explained. There were only two when the server said there were supposed to be three types, all served with stale pre-grilled pita. \n\nTuna wasn't even seared! It looked like there was too much liquid in the pan or the pan they used was not hot enough because the tuna was barely gray i.e. not seared golden brown in a hot pan. The tuna also looked like and tasted like it was frozen ahi and not fresh. The accompanying noodles were fine but pedestrian.\n\nThe steak was Terrible!!! The New York steak was actually cooked a correct medium rare but it was under seasoned and incredibly dry and flavorless. It simply did not taste like anything at all. It came with over seasoned garlic fries that had 3 dipping sauces. One sauce was BBQ straight out of the bottle (sysco brand probably), one that tasted like ranch with buffalo sauce, and the other was just plain awful.\n\nBy this time the band was well into testing the instruments 4-5 feet from our table and the lights guy was still unrelenting. We wanted to tell a manager how bad their place was but he wasn't around. Needless to say we left without dessert. \n\nThe only thing this place has going for it is its decent wine list. \n\nI expect more from our local restaurants. There is NO REASON we can't have the same standards (at a minimum) that we have on the strip. If someone actually is serious about their restaurant and heeds this advice they will make plenty of money. For now all we have is a bunch of restaurants owned by business people with no passion for what they do and thus no soul."
0,"Oh gosh, it was clearly after 1:00am when my roommate suggested we go to BWW for a late night snack.  I was actually starving and agreed, even though I had an 8:00am meeting.  \n\nThe great thing is that all BWWs are very consistent.  When you enter, you see the restaurant dining area for folks who prefer a non bar scene.  Keep in mind, this place closes after hours.  In the back is the bar area.  The bar takes up a lot of the space, obviously being the focal point of the area.  The bar area is filled with round bar stools, big screen TVs for the game and sports memorabilia.  The bartender was the only server on duty at the time.  He was nice, however, it took soooo long to place our order or get our check.  It was to the point that we would just stare at him until he came around.  Granted, there were three other parties in there at the moment, but c'mon.  I was a little turned off by that.  \n\nFor starters, we got the cheese curds for $5.19.  Battered and fried cheddar curds served with a yellowish dipping sauce.  The curds were not good at all in my opinion.  The batter seemed stale and it came off as if they sat out for quite some time.  The dipping sauce made it worse.  I couldn't even tell what it was.  Just not good.  For my meal, I got the snack size traditional wings, mild flavor, for $5.99.  You get about 5 wings flavored the way you like it.  The mild sauce was flavorful but a little hot for my taste buds. The blue cheese dipping sauce made it better.  I do appreciate the fact that they made a good wing, I'll give them that.  \n\nAlthough it was after hours, I wasn't that impressed by this location.  It's close to my house, so I know I'll eventually be back.  Hard to say when, though.  In an area filled with restaurants, it's not really standing out as a first choice for me in the future."
0,This property has the most unprofessional manager that I have ever encoutered.  She challenges residents to fights!
0,"I typically go to the McCormick Ranch or Scottsdale Road locations in Scottsdale, but  on occasion go to this location as it's close to my work.  The weight area seemed decent, but I was particularly struck by how outdated and dark the pool appeared - as compared to the other locations.  The pool plaster itself seemed dirty, rusty poles and dirty concrete around the pool, paint chipping off the ceiling... I just didn't get a clean, sanitary, slick feeling at all.  The guys locker room, particularly the showers, seemed very dingy and the lockers were quite small.  Considering this is Paradise Valley I was unpleasantly surprised."
1,This place is so amazing! I used to go to Terrible's but I would be sitting in the lobby for over 30 minutes. This place gets you in and out under 30 minutes. They've always been super friendly. This is my regular spot for oil changes
0,"Ehhhh.\n\nThey painted the bar surface (never a good move), cheapened offerings,  raised prices.  Food is so so, service hit or miss. Patio is nice,  but you likely have better choices."
1,"This place is fantastic. First is because the sandwiches are so good, I have tried just about every one and you can't go wrong. The second reason is the price, I believe it's about 6 dollars or so for a sandwich, very cheap when you consider what else is on the strip. \n\nThe only down side is that most of the time there is a long line, no matter what time of day you go. But the staff moves it along pretty well so the wait is never too long."
1,"Le cirque, one of the 5 star restaurants in Las Vegas was definitely worth my wild! The environment is totally relaxing, romantic view overlooking the Bellagio Fountain, and the energy from the colorful silks ceiling is simple but artistic. My order was the 2 fix course that offers Escargots as my appetizer and my main entree was scallop with fresh lobster tail layered with butter, pesto, a bit of spice, & more. Oh French cuisine, how you make my stomach twirl with butter so of course I subsided that with a glass of merlot and another.  My friends and I were very comfortable and overjoyed with how etiquette their service was. We were fortunate to have a chance to meet the kitchen crew including the head chief- p.s. they were all fine looking fellows  and men in the kitchen just makes this restaurant my number one rating of 2009."
0,"Feel slightly bad writing this review, because I know they've just opened. BUT, the service was pretty terrible. We sat outside for lunch, and we were not acknowledged with a server for about 10-15 minutes. During a weekday at lunch time, I feel like it's especially important to be fast because generally people need to go back to work. \n\nAnyway, I had ordered a bellow mushroom salad and a soup to go (wanted some dinner for that night!), and my friend ordered an omelette. They brought my soup out first which was in a bowl and definitely not to go. They fixed it. No big deal. But then they brought my salad and my friend's omelette in to go containers. Alright. I guess we'll take it. That honestly wasn't that big of deal either. But when I started eating my salad I noticed there was no dressing on it at all. Definitely a big deal. Also there was only one bellow mushroom. Really? Kind of sad considering the salad was $10 dollars. My salad literally consisted of one mushroom, some diced peppers, and a few olives, with NO dressing. \n\nI have not tried my soup yet, so hopefully that is good. All in all, I was really disappointed with the service, my meal, the price, and with all of that in mind, it made the 'Parisian' decor seem really cheap to me. When I first sat down I thought the place was super cute. But good decor can only be complimented with an outstanding meal. By the time I left, everything screamed cheap. My meal just was not what I had when I was in Paris. Literally could have made it at home."
1,"This place is a true gem.  The food is always fresh and LOCAL.  The service is top-notch.  I usually sit at the bar and watch a game, and the bartender Brian is great to chat with about the game, or recommend a wine to go with my meal.  Highly recommend!"
1,"This food is legit. I have always ordered delivery from here. I usually never have anything to complain about  because Rainbow Garden is great. BUT, their owners/managers are always so angry for some reason. This is not the way to handle customer service, people! You can't yell at someone if they don't like the food they ordered! On the plus side of that situation, they gave me something else w/o charge. \n\nBraised chicken/shrimp/whateverelse protein is always good. Same with the lo mein ..I've had way more things there but I can't remember but it's great. Try anything. But the weird tofu thing it tastes like hard compressed dough that was uncooked and super dry ..."
1,Store is fairly new and much bigger and cleaner than our nearest location on Bethany Home. We drive the extra distance to go to this location. Customer service seems to be good and if you go early in the a.m. it is usually not busy at all.
1,"I have to give Pizzeria Napoletana the five stars. The reason for such a high rating is because when my mouth meets an amazing dish of pesto pasta - I am a very happy girl! The restaurant may be small, but the portions were not. The dish of spaghetti swam in the pesto. They nailed it. \n\nMy husband had a really good cannelloni and agreed that Pizzeria Napoletana was a good choice for our Italian food night while visiting Montreal for a short time.\n\nOne of the downsides is that they do not accept credit cards, so I think they should step into 2011 and figure out a way to start accepting cards. We did not have enough cash on us and had to use the in house ATM.\n\nOne other thing is that I think they could do a little better on the bread selection - I feel like I was eating a hot dog bun instead of Italian bread."
0,"I was not impressed with their barbacoa, Cafe Rio is wayyyy better! Their prices suck... $3.50 for chips and 2 oz of guacamole? Wtf?"
1,So much fun! There is nothing like a bar with a full size pool to lounge around.
0,"Apparently I don't learn my own lesson and ordered the lychee drink again,  I'm just  a sucker for these drinks.\n\nDish wise:\nScallops + no texture\nBeef chow fun ++ of the dishes pretty good\nKung pao chicken - aside from spice, not much taste\nShrimp fried rice - plain\nBbq pork - dry"
0,one specific member lacked on customer service...  And for a starbucks employee I expected more. Its not busy yet it took awhile to receive just my Black tea.... Manager was polite and assisted with my short n simple order. But oh well I guess ... tsk tsk
0,"ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH FOR THIS HOLE BUT WE HAD TO GIVE IT SOMETHING.....\n\n\nI must say that after reading several other reviews I really should have read more of them  before I gave this place a try again.  We walked in on a quiet Thursday night with the place practically deserted. We were not greeted nor asked to place an order, we just kinda rolled up to the register and \""said can we order now\"", and the girl said sure! We order two (2) simple cheese steak sandwiches with fries. We must have waited over 20 mins  but still no food but we noticed how many people were picking up their food to go. I asked why customers waiting inside the restaurant were being delayed while orders were passing us by?   Needless to say, after another few mins the food was served  but on a TWO DAY OLD BREAD and meat that looked like it had been recycled. I could't est it and received my money back. We went across the street to Barros Pizza and was very happy with the service and meal. SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND EXPENSE AND CHOOSE ANOTHER PLACE LIKE LUKES TO ENJOY THE KIND OF FOOD WE WERE SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE AT THIS PLACE."
1,"This would be our second trip here, on the last trip we had the chicken Alfredo and the chicken curry.\n\nThe Alfredo was excellent,  the curry, not so good.\n\nThe staff were great, a second trip was needed.\n\nFirst off tonight, the cheese and ale soup. OMG, excellent, something reminded me of home, I can't place my finger on what exactly, but a great soup.\n\nI went for the Alfredo again, still one of the best in town.\n\nThe wife had their version of chicken pad thai, OMG, seriously one of the best pad thai's I've ever had, from talking to the owners are putting it on the menu, a great addition.\n\nDownside,  it can be a little cramped when it fills up, that's about it.\n\nSo if you're in the mood for good pasta dishes, try here."
1,"One word can describe the food: YUM!  We have been researching some vegetarian restaurants lately and this is a real find.  We ordered the Spring Rolls for an appetizer and it was delicious.  My partner commented that it's the best one he's had.  For the main course, we ordered \""Chicken\"" Egg Foo Young and he got the Sweet and Sour \""Chicken.\""  My Egg Foo Young was very tasty.  It has to be the best one I've had.  The egg has a nice crunch and the inside is very moist.  I just loved the texture and the sauce was perfect.  I couldn't finish the plate because it was huge and I was full but was tempted to eat the leftovers.  Good thing my partner stopped me from eating the leftovers.  He had the Sweet and Sour \""Chicken,\"" and it was also tasty.  He commented that it was too sweet but it definitely was good when I tasted it.  As everyone has said, it is a hole in the wall.  It is located in an old strip mall.  The owner, Ping, was always smiling and courteous.  Overall, if you have restricted yourself to eating vegetarian or pescatarians like us, this is a definite place to try."
0,"This place needs a health inspection. The walls, the tables, and especially the kitchen need to be inspected. The fish is not fresh n falls on health problems.."
0,"Their pho is the worst I had in the az area.  with respect to the other rave review, their only saving grace is good service, esp for people who had not had vietnamese food before, as their servers do speak better english and because they are not crowded usually, they would have more time and patience to explain the food to you.  \n\nThe reason why they are not crowded is because they are located in a vietnamese/asian centric mall with large crowds of asians shopping for food and groceries at the mekong supermarket, and they know a good pho from a bad one.  Trust me I am asian :)   \n\nGoing here would be like a vegetarian going to texas roadhouse and having them cook up a steak and try to explain to you the fine art of grilling aged beef.  \n\nIf you are at the Mekong plaza area, and U need some vietnamese food, go to the other vietnamese restaurant that is directly across from them, I can't recall the name, but they have a large menu full of rice dishes and stuff.  U can order like noodle items too, I love their dry house special noodles there.  \n\nIf you are new to vietnamese food and would like an intro, I guess this place might work, so 1 star for that.  there are a lot of other places U can go to like Khai Hoang, Dat Vang or even Saigon."
1,I enjoyed my lunch here and I didn't even get around to the ice cream.  I ordered a cobb salad and a bowl of vegetable beef soup.  The vegetable beef soup was hearty and flavorful.  The ingredients in the cobb salad tasted fresh and the portion size was quite large.  They used some other type of cheese instead of the bleu cheese crumbles which was fine since I didn't even really notice.  Service was friendly and quick from start to finish.
1,"We know very little about German food...but we do know we really enjoyed our meal last night with friends who are very particular about what they eat...we were not rushed..the server, Kathy H. was very patient in explaining the menu, and the owner stopped by the table to be sure we were satisified...I happily recommend this place..it's casual, friendly and the food is realllly good."
0,"This was my first time experiences \""Tibetan\"" food and wasn't impressed. I am experienced with Asian cuisine having living in China for 5 months. I must say this restaurant seemed like simple Chinese cuisine with with a bit of an Indian fusion. The food was bland and simple, maybe that's what Tibetan is like. If so, Tibetan food does not agree with my palate."
1,"I have been going to Dentist R Us for years. They are professional and personable. I wouldn't change dental offices for nothing. I highly recommend this office for other like myself, children and seniors as well."
0,I will never ever order from this place again. Two freaking hours late with my food and they didn't even give me a discount for being late.
0,"Another disappointment in Scottsdale...No more franchises, please.\nBelow average sweets, that's it!"
0,"Poor service. We waited for our food so long that I had to leave for a meeting... Several customers who came in well after us received their food as we waited.. My co worker brought back the food since I could no longer wait.. Of course my order was not there. \n\nIt's like they completely forgot about us. Not exactly the best way to treat a paying customer. \n\nI had to call and was told to come back. Apparently they did not understand that reason I could not wait, was because I had to go back to work. They wasted over an hour and a half of my time... Just for hummus. All they had to do was put it in a container. It's not like it was a special order. Hummus and pita. That is it.\n\nI will not be coming back. There are plenty of other places on the north shore where I would rather spend my money."

1,"In the heart of Summerlin is where you'll find Honey Salt. The family and I come here for dinner. I love the interior. It's bright, spacious, airy and a bit homey. The service was great and the food was pretty amazing. Entrees are anywhere from $22-30 and desserts are $9. \n\nScottish Salmon:\nServed with quinoa pilaf, fennel and chimichurri. The salmon was not dry 4/5\n\nCaramelized Sea Scallops:\nServed with cauliflower, cauliflower and vanilla bean puree and truffle sauce. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the sauce was amazing! 5/5\n\nMary's Free-Range Brick Oven Chicken Breast:\nServed with mac and cheese, peppers and natural jus. Slightly crisp seasoned skin, chicken was tender and juicy. I've been having great luck with chicken dishes lately - this is one of the good ones on my list. 4/5\n\nTriple Strawberry Shortcake:\nHomemade strawberry ice cream, strawberry jam, fresh strawberries and mascarpone cream. The \""cake\"" it came with was light. This was just fabulous! 4.5/5\n\nBrown Bag Baked Apple Pie:\nServed with vanilla ice cream. The pie was good but it wasn't something that would normally excite me. 3/5"
0,"Just to give a little bit about my BBQ credentials.  I am from the Kansas City area and I judge BBQ contests there.  I have been judging for 3 years now with 27 contests under my rather large belt.  I also have a smoker and BBQ on the weekends.  Being from one of the BBQ Mecca's I have been trying various BBQ places here in Charlotte.\n\nMy visit to Mac's was on a Sunday and it was about half full.  Since I was by myself I sat at the bar.  The bartender was friendly and patient as I tried to decide what to order.  I had the \""A little Bit of it All\"" combo platter: beef brisket, pulled pork, beer can chicken and ribs with slaw and baked beans for my sides.  My food arrived fairly quickly and looked good.  There was a heaping pile of pulled pork surrounded by chicken, brisket and ribs.  But, for $16 they better not skimp on the portions.  \n\nI tried the pulled pork first as that is my favorite BBQ meat.  The pulled pork was very disappointing.  It had no flavor at all and wasn't very tender, but it wasn't dry which was the only good thing about it.  It was like it had never seen the inside of a smoker.  There were four different types of sauces to try, Mustard, Carolina, Red & Vinegar.  Adding sauce to the pulled pork made it much better.  Since the pork had no flavor it was the perfect platform to taste each sauce.  The mustard was my favorite with the pork.\n\nNext I tried the beef brisket.  Most BBQ places serve brisket in thin slices about 1/8\"".  The brisket on my plate was one slice about 1/2\"" thick which looked like it had grill marks on it.  Not the way I like my brisket at all.  The big hunk of brisket also looked like it had been dipped in sauce as well.  Good brisket should be tender and pull apart easily without falling apart.  This brisket was not tender, I could almost cut it with my fork, but had to use my knife a couple of times.  It wasn't tough, but it wasn't tender either.  The flavor was pretty good though and the meat moist.\n\nI tried the ribs next.  They were a little on the small side but looked good.  Flavor wise they were smoky, too smoky, like they had been smoked too long.  After the first couple of hours of smoking meat doesn't absorb any more smoke and the smoke flavor builds up on the meat itself giving the bitter flavor.  The meat on the ribs was falling off the bones, but was a little tough, that too is an indication the ribs have been over cooked.  Again they weren't bad, but they weren't great either.  \n\nLast I tried the chicken.  The chicken was the best piece of meat on the platter.  It was moist and tender with a good flavor.  The chicken had a light dusting of rub which complemented the meat well.\n\nOverall the atmosphere of Mac's was nice.  The bartender was friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  The prices are at the high end for a BBQ place.  The portion size was good, but the quality of the BBQ was middle of the road.  Two of the best things were the chicken and the OMB Copper I had to drink with my dinner.  If you want great BBQ, try somewhere else."
0,Mediocre for the price.
1,"We had a good lunch. The Reuben had 2 kinds of cheese, turkey BBQ BLT was delicious, the chicken strips had thyme which was a nice twist, and buffalo chicken wrap was good. The only I would change is the coleslaw. As a side item the serving size was small. The restaurant is well run, our waitress was attentive and management is on site and present (nice change from most restaurants lately). I was not a fan of the restaurant that was here before so this a welcome change."
0,We've been at the Blue Lemon twice. Once for breakfast and once for dinner. We won't be hurrying back. The food was delivered before we were settled in our chairs. Not once did the server come back to our table. The food was good though.\nAs for the operation of the restaurant itself I give it a failing grade. That is the lack of training from ownership and management.
0,"Okay, so I guess I should start by saying that we came for breakfast, first time trying their breakfast menu. They had tons of yummy sounding options, but I settled on a blueberry pecan pancake, over medium eggs, and bacon. My boyfriend got the french toast.\n\nHis french toast sounded soo good on the menu description, and when it was served, it looked fantastic, except for the griddled bananas (served in the peel, which was black and mushy, tasted good but very unappealing looking) his french toast tasted like nothing, and was mushy and in general, just kind of blah.\n\nMy pancake was HUGE, and yummy, but my over medium eggs were basically raw, I mean the yolks were super runny (which is fine, I never, ever send food back) I was going to eat them until I noticed that the whites werent even cooked, I mean, runny whites on an over medium egg? Yuck! I asked the waitress for new ones and she obliged saying, \""oh sure, you might want more of an over medium.\"" Um, yeah cause that's what I ordered. She brings the eggs back out and clearly the cook was annoyed that they got sent back, because he cooked the crap out of these eggs, I mean, they were beyond well done. Whatever, I mean the pancake was so huge I didn't even need the eggs at that point.\n\nFast forward to them picking up the bill, I was paying by credit, they took the card, and then a different person came back and asked for Id, which I accidentally left at home. (If its your policy to get Id for credit cards, that's fine, but maybe ask for the identification before you run the card?) I explained I didn't have it and instead of offering another option he glared at me and asked if it was really my card. I mean, come on. I said that yes it is my card and he just mumbled something under his breath and walked off! We had cash, and would have paid in cash! To top it off we had to wait another few minutes for them to bring me a pen so I could sign the receipt.  Really? I wanted to love this place, again the menu for breakfast is really enticing. But our general experience was way off.\n\nAll in all, I've eaten here a few times (other times for dinner) and in general, they definitely wow you with portion sizes but they lack actual flavor. They describe their food as midwestern farm food with a twist. After eating here a handful of times I'm convinced the twist is the portion size and the giant sprig of rosemary they serve with everything."
1,I really like the selection of this store. They have a great return policy and I've never been dissatisfied with their service!
0,This practice sends out junk mail and there is no way  to get off.  From now on I am going to write a negative review about everyone who sends me junk mail
1,"This is old school Las Vegas with great food, unbelievable service and an intimate atmosphere. They prepare many dishes table side like Caesar Salad, Lobster Bisque and Banana Foster. The prices are reasonable, there are intimate booths for a romantic dinner and tables for a fun time with family and friends. As a bread eater, the bread basket with 3 different butters was awesome. There is a good wine list with knowledgeable staff."
1,Just tires and fast friendly service. What more could you want?
1,"We went here for the first time tonight and loved it! everything was so fresh tasting and wonderful. I recommend getting the veggie plate with 7 selections of salad and hummus and then get a kabob combo.  Share both for a delicious dinner for 2.  The grape leaves were terrific as was the lamp kabobs.  Also, very lovely interior decor.  Will go back when we visit Knight Theater or Bechtler Museum."
0,They've moved... Thanks for the heads up???
1,"I saw this place was officially open after a not so pleasant experience at Pizza Hut next door.  I decided to give them a try for lunch since I work from home and need something quick. I ordered the lunch special with orange chicken, fried rice and noodles.  I also added egg rolls and everything was superb!  Huge portions as always, and everything tasted great. Service was remarkable and the place was really clean.  I'll definitely be back since I live around the corner."
1,"I hate to be the one to do this, because this is a beautiful restaurant and the food is incredible, but man, it's not very good value for money.\n\nIs the sushi absolutely pristine, melt-in-your-mouth delicious?  Of course!  But I've had sushi that is 95% as good for half the price ($250 for two, with 1 carafe of sake, ouch!).  I don't mind spending a lot for a great meal, and don't get me wrong, this place serves an outstanding experience; I just leave feeling slightly hungry and a little bit shorted.  The nigiri is extremely small, and you only get ONE piece for the quoted amount on the menu.  Even for the cheap stuff!  I think you can stretch 2 pieces of tamago for $6, guys.\n\nOne of my personal \""Yelp filters\"" (how I judge whether a review is worth paying attention to) is when people praise \""portion size\"".  I get images in my head of people going to Chilli's and getting a three course meal and saying they were \""pleasantly full\"" on their 3500 calorie meal.  \n\nOn the other hand - c'mon, guys!  I understand that flying fresh fish into the desert is expensive, but you know what?  I live in the western side of the Mojave Desert and there's a sushi place near my house where the owner does exactly that.  And my wife and I can have a full, satisfying omakase meal of all fresh, delicious fish for like $150, with two bottles of sake.  \n\nOn that note, there is a brand/style of sake that Kabuto claims they only carry.  I HIGHLY recommend it.  I have no idea if you can only get it at this restaurant, but it's incredible.\n\nI'd just like to stress that this isn't a BAD review.  I am picking nits to the nTH degree, here.  The food is absolutely flawless, and really, a testament to how good it is - I wish I could have gotten more of it for the same money!"
1,"Loved this restaurant! The bagels were delicious; the meat knish was phenomenal; and, the service was very warm and attentive. I gave four stars instead of five because they do not have a credit card machine and I had to use their ATM machine in order to pay my bill. However, that did not take away from the quality of the food or service at Harrie's. Will definitely eat here again the next time I am in Las Vegas!"
1,"We came here on a Monday night to celebrate my wife's birthday.   We arrived at 6:30 and waited about 45 minutes.   It was nice considering that I have waited at other buffets for 3 hours.  Dinner on a Monday night was $44.99.  The cashier gave us their \""Total Reward\"" discount, even though I did not have my card.   Dinner for the child was a mere $25.   This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.  Unfortunately, I do not have enough money and stomach space to eat at the top rated buffets more often to be able to say that it is the best buffet.  \n\nThe food was very good.  We had way too much crab legs, mussels, shrimp and other shellfish.  It was a good thing that I brought my cholesterol medication so that I could eat more.  I tried my crab legs hot, but, by the time I started eating them, it was lukewarm.  Not a big difference between hot and cold.  The carving station was okay.  Well done meats are not edible.  When I went back for something less cooked, it was perfection.  The lamb was a hit and miss.  I had a piece that was full of salt, and a couple other pieces that were perfectly seasoned.  There were many things that I did not have an opportunity to try.\n\nThe Asian woman working in the dessert station deserves her own paragraph.  The daughter and I asked her if they had a candle since it was my wife's birthday.  She told me that she did, but, told me to wait a minute.  She went to the other side of her workstation, and starting doing something with wax paper.  I thought to myself, \""Why did I ask?  This girl just ignored me.  I'll never get my candle\"".   A few minutes later, she gives me a dish.   She wrote in chocolate on the dish \""Happy Birthday!\"" and she also handed me a candle.  But, that wasn't all!  She then took a flan, and put it on the dish that she had prepared for me.  She then took the candle back from me and placed it on the flan.   Like a helpless person, I then asked if she had matches to light my candle.   She had something better!  She grabbed her torch and lit the candle for me.  I could not thank her enough.  She was the best employee there that I encountered.\n\nService was okay.  They cleared our plates frequently during the beginning of our meal.  But, toward the end of our meal, they stopped coming.  Our waitress did keep my cup filled.  \n\nOverall, this is a very good buffet.   Good food with lots of selections with some outstanding employees.   I'll be back!  Hopefully, someone can treat us next time!"
0,The staff is not friendly and feel overbearing.  Not a fun experience shopping here....
1,love the enchiladas!
1,Holy mother of buffets!  All you can eat sushi and chinese food?  AND it's good?  And they have 4 soups and even cream cheese crab puffs!?  RAD!\n\nNow don't get me wrong... I didn't DARE eat any of the shellfish - that's just common sense unless you have a stomach of iron.\n\nThe miracle?  $7 each.  SEVEN!?\n\nWOW.
0,"this place doesn't live up to the hype, in my opinion.  the alcoholic milkshakes are good.  the sweet potato chips are pretty good.  but, the burgers?  meh.  \n\ngo to tessaro's."
0,"I would not recommend this place. The only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is because they were at least minimally polite. Certainly not friendly or even pleasant, but fairly polite.\n\nThey did a poor job on the wheels and the inside of my car. I realize they aren't going to do a deep/thorough wheel cleaning for the mid-range price but at least clean the visible parts. The inside still had crumbs in the cup holders, pet hair on the removable carpets and black smudges on the metal foot rest plate.\n\nThe quality was similar to if I went through an automatic carwash and took 15 min of my own time to vacuum the inside. That would have only cost $5 though, not $25-35 with tip. I'll stick to Fabulous Freddy's or doing it myself from now on. $20-30 at Freddy's and your car is like brand new along with clean workers who are very nice and cordial."
0,"I should start by mentioning that this place won the James Beard Foundation Award this year for Best Chef within it's region. With accolades like that, I tend to have high expectations.... Expectations that were not met.\n\nWhen you arrive at Lotus of Siam, it looks just like every other Thai restaurant found in any old town. It appears to be made up of several converted spaces that makes it feel like a Bingo hall. There are water damage stains on the ceiling where crystal chandeliers from the early 80's hang under fluorescent lights. Dusty framed pieces of art depicting elephants drawn with sequins adorn the walls. It really couldn't be any more of a cliche. Then there was the menu. Inundated with over 150 items, I was enormously overwhelmed by the task at hand. Luckily, the website lists a number of recommendations within each course. So we went with the Koong Sarong or \""Prawn in Blanket.\"" This dish featured marinated prawns wrapped with bacon and wonton wraps, deep fried, and served with homemade sweet and sour sauce. Was it good? Of course! It was amazing! But what isn't when wrapped in bacon and deep fried. The prawns were done just right and the sauce balanced out the heaviness of the wonton nicely.\n\nThey say that the true test of a brilliant chef is to order the simplest menu item and see how they are able to make it their own. It seemed like a reasonable challenge, but not so much that night. I went with my old standby Pad Thai and couldn't wait to see what Chef Saipin Chutima would do. Unfortunately, I was sadly underwhelmed. The dish tasted okay, but I had seen this dozens of times before. It was by no means a revelation. In fact, it was overly oily and too sweet. My companions ordered Charbroiled Beef which was very grisly, and while the Sweet and Sour Chicken was nice and fresh, the use of cilantro was overpowering and just too much. It could very well be that we just did not order the right menu items. But in my opinion, any item coming out of such a heralded kitchen should be cooked to perfection. \n\nMy advice: save up and splurge at a \""Strip\"" restaurant such as Shibuya at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino. It will cost a bit more but the experience will be worth it. My lesson learned: every dining experience and plate is different. Critically acclaimed restaurants do not always deliver as you would like them to."
0,"This place charged my credit card three times, then came back and lied to me saying they're system was down so I paid cash only to find out they charged me and didn't tell me later. Then the general manager David says he would give me $50 credit the next day. The next day he changes his mind and acts like a complete a$$hole to me. 0/5 stars."
1,We had some cheap seats and at the last minute they moved us to gold circle seating.  So nice and unexpected!  It was great!\n\nThe performance was a mix of talented dancers and acrobats.  Good music and colors!  It was a kaleidoscope of eye candy.
0,"I took my dad here for an early Father's Day lunch (the Friday before Father's Day), bad choice when your father is Indian. \n\nThe ambiance and decor was very nice; and the service was good, considering how busy they were.\n\nNow on to the good stuff (well the not so good stuff in this case) ..the food. We frequented the restaurant during the afternoon, during the lunch buffet. I was excited to try somewhere new and the reviews about this place were great. As soon as I approached the buffet, I could see that the vegetables were soaked in oil. I was mortified. I'm not the healthiest person, but I could not knowingly eat such oily Indian food, especially when I cook it myself and I know it does not require that much oil. My dad had the buffet, and was not very pleased. I ordered malai kofta and dal makhani off of the menu. The malai kofta was not good, I took it home and threw it away (and I was raised to never waste food). The naan was ok, nothing to write home about. The plus side to this adventure was the dal makhani ..it was really tasty (: \n\nMost Indian restaurants in Vegas are not cheap, and this place is no exception. I don't mind paying for quality when I receive it ..but I did not receive it here. I will not be back."
1,"I'm surprised by some of these negative reviews.  My friends and I had a tremendous meal here with great service.  We did not have any entrees, though, and opted for splitting about a dozen apps and side dishes.  The oysters with the cucumber sauce was a real standout as was the sweet pea tortellini.  The bbq shrimp were delicious, the bisque was light and flavorful.  The ricotta gnocchi was a little heavy on the mushrooms, but the hush puppies and mac and cheese were decadent!"
0,"It pains me to give this 2 stars, the brewpub was a stop on every Vegas trip, 2-3x's a year, and it's still where I'll go to watch the big game of the day over an appetizer and beer, but it isn't the same.  The beer is no longer brewed onsite, and there is a noticable lack in quality, but their beer list is still among the better on that end of the strip."
0,"I HATE PLACES THAT DON'T GIVE YOU THE WHOLE BOTTLE OF KETCHUP. This is the largest infraction in my book AND my Strike 4 read below for other strikeouts.   With that stated, I think there's something inherently wrong and disturbing when I get a little midget cup with ketchup in it.  I like my ketchup and feel that I should put this condiment on anything I desire.  You also have to ask for ketchup even with home fries or french fries, it's a crying shame in my book. An outright atrocity.  And then after we asked for it, the server only brought it out for 2 out of 4 of our party. So he disappeared again for 5 mins to go back and get 2 more small cups. Shame really a shame.\n\n4 of us went here for breakfast, all staying out Caesar's so it made sense.  We walked up, rather early before 9 am, and even though they had at least 10 open 4 top tables, were told it would be a 15 min wait (Strike 1)   We were in town for a convention and really didn't have the 15 mins so we sat up at the bar. Bar service was VERY slow, guess why, b/c everyone was sitting up there, so there was NOT enough staff to handle the full bar. We waited on numerous occasions for everything from greeting, to drink orders, to silverware, to ketchup, to more ketchup, to more drink delivery, to check delivery (Strike 2)--this is a MANAGEMENT problem in my opinion. Staffing was a problem throughout the restaurant. \n\nOrder our food. Presentation was horrendous see my picture on how terrible my plate looked.  It's also horrendous that GRITS are as expensive as they are on this menu-I think they were like $11. It's also a travesty that you can't sub-out home  fries for anything else [grits, fruit, tomatoes, etc] (Strike 3).  It's also a shame that their cheapest breakfast is like $17 for just eggs, toast, and homefries. My other friend actually returned her meal b/c it was ice cold.  \n\nManagement has to work on the number of employees working, availability of ketchup, salt and pepper and silverware on the table, and presentation and timeliness of delivery, as well as, seating and the hostess stand that's a crying shame in Las Vegas."
1,"Dark Maroon Leather, and Thick Wood Handled Steak Knives. (not even necessary to cut through the buttery thick steaks this place fires up)  Amazing Service, and Steaks. The Rib eye medium is perfect, completely perfect.  Seared on the outside on their 2000 degree grill locks in the flavor and taste like nothing I've ever tried.  The Flemmings Potatoes are a cheesy cream filled sensation, and to boot they have the best Lava Cake on the planet.  And seriously even the mints you take with you to go are amazing!  LOL.  Quality from the bottom to the top.  \n\nIm not a \""fine dining\"" kind of guy, nothing makes me more pissed off than spending $50 on a meal for one and having to hit burger king on the way home cuz Im still starving because they gave me a 3 ounce \""french delicacy\"" cut, draped in butter truffle crap, with a sprig of asparagus and a mint leaf.  Those of you who've ever tried to impress a girl know what Im talking about.  Flemmings is not this kinda place. Be prepared to drop over $100 for 2, but its worth every dime!  I'm a superfan!"
1,"Even though the baked goods are not made on the premises here - they are brought in from the main Dormont location - it smells like a bakery should.  There was so much to choose from - fresh baked bread, cookies, doughnuts, beautiful cakes, cannoli, etc.  I was even lucky enough to buy the last two paczki in the store.  One was filled with chocolate buttercream and drizzled with a chocolate glaze.  The other one was filled with whipped cream, fresh strawberries, and dusted with powdered sugar.  They were both fresh and delicious and worth the trip (although they won't be available until Feb again).  One note - we visited here once on Monday and there was basically nothing to be had in the store.  The prices are very reasonable, considering the quality of most of the baked goods.  Make sure to visit on the weekends when they are stocked to the rafters with goodies!"
1,"The place I normally get my haircut was closed, so needed to find a place I could get a quick trim in the area I was in. Found this place and before I even sat down in the waiting area, they called my name. Great service and happy with the trim!"

0,"So disappointing! I heard such great things about Johnny Mac's but after having pizza there for dinner, I am far from impressed...\n\nI went in with my husband on a Monday night. We were seated in a booth that had ice on the seat, leaving me with a lovely wet spot on my ass. The hostess asked what we would like to drink but didn't know what beers they had. Perhaps management should consider not having drink orders taken by a young girl that doesn't even appear to be old enough to serve liquor...? A second employee came by with our waters a few minutes later. \n\nWe looked over the menu, waiting for one of the multiple waitresses that walked by to stop and acknowledge us. Finally someone came over, gave us an excuse about how no one knew whose table we were, and took our order. \n\nWe went with a large mushroom pizza. I debated getting wings since I heard such good things about them but decided to pass. The pizza didn't take long to come out, it felt like we waited longer to order then we did for the food. \n\nUpon first glance, the pizza was all good. Nice thin crust that was golden brown, lots of cheese, plenty of mushrooms. The cheese was tasty, as were the mushrooms. The crust was like rubber though, when I picked up a piece to try to take a bite it flopped over. The only part of the crust with any crunch to it was the edges. Pretty disappointing. \n\nIf I had never heard of Johnny Mac's, this would be my first and only time visiting. Since I live nearby I will probably give them another shot sooner or later... Everyone has an off night at some point, right?"
0,Service 8/10\n- out server was very attentive ^_^\n\nPapaya salad 6/10\n- it was big and good just not spicy enough(yes we even asked for it to be spicier) \nChao Tom 4/10\n- very bland but big \nBun rieu 3/10\n- this is one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes but I've had better. It's really not great in taste it has more eggs then anything. And wayyyy to much fried onion. Broth didn't taste like it is suppose for bun rieu broth.
1,"This bar has the best atmosphere. Cute blue outside, dark and intimate inside, with ivy and a collection of audio tapes on the walls. Free wifi for studying during the day, and delicious food and drinks at night. Else's has a homey, neighborhood atmosphere but is also very welcoming. It's a great place for a date or a chill night out with friends, and the excellent music they play is an added bonus. I would give this place 5 stars because it is one of my favorites in the city save one fact: their liquor license requires you to get food if you are getting alcohol as well. While their nachos are the best I've ever had (seriously, I dream about them), it is easy to rack up quite a tab as their pints are slightly more expensive than average. Since sometimes I only want a drink and no food, I've had to forego many trips to this place, and it is something for potential patrons to keep in mind when they visit. Even so, it's a phenomenal and cute bar that is definitely worth a visit...or ten!"
1,"Although the outside is not spectacular, I was impressed with their set up and buffet service. I was feeling the mood, the music, the food aroma, the curtains, etc. It was a nice place and our waiter was very attentive and funny. The food was delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed every dish. Mango Lassi was to die for. Overall, lunch buffet price is within inexpensive-affordable. I will be sure to make a trip here whenever I go to Vegas!!"
1,"When I first came here, I was very skeptical but little did I know that I would actually love this place!  Prices are very good.  Quality of food is excellent.  You can definitely taste the freshness of the fish.  Although, they don't have a lot of selections when it comes to their all you can eat sushi, it's still the place I go to when I crave it.  They just started it so that can be one of the reasons they didn't add all the sushi on that menu.  They have the best Green Mussels ever!  My all time favorites are the chef's specials like the Island Roll...I love it!  I haven't tried anything that I didn't like.  \n\nThe staff here are very nice.  The atmosphere is great.  Very clean restaurant."
0,"I was very disappointed by this restaurant. The service was good, but the food was not very tasty and the wine list, while very good, was more expensive than the dinner! It felt like an over-priced tourist restaurant."
0,"Being from NYC I enjoy going to a lot of shows. This was something that everyone was talking about and I never got the chance to catch one in the city. I ran across a discount while planning my vacation in Vegas and jumped on it immediately. I then googled and youtube some scenes from it to prepare myself. From what I saw online, I wasn't too impressed but thought it was cute and hoped that it's better live. It's exactly like it is online. The show was cute, I did give in a little chuckle here and there. But honestly if I had to pay full price for this, I would have been quite unhappy. I suggest going only if you get a discount, it's possible that this is only the Vegas show and not an accurate representation of the NYC one."

1,"The weather turned cold and rainy my first evening in Montreal, but after being stuck on a plane for six hours, I was determined to take a walk and have a good meal.\n\nI found Cibo et Vino in one of the hotel guides, and as I love Italian food and the resto was within walking distance, I set our for a bit of adventure. Armed with an umbrella provided by the Fairmont, I arrived at the restaurant within 10 minutes, a bit wet and famished.\n\nAt the door I hesitated to enter, not because of the menu, but because I could see only one occupied table. Still, the promise of pasta overruled my trepidation. It was, after all, Monday--a typically slow night.\n\nThe decor was quaint Italian and the menu was fairly simple: soup of the day, a few salads, pizzas, and about a dozen pastas--mostly classics, with some twists. I ordered the cream of mushroom soup and, though the sauce would be similar, I decided on one of the signature dishes: pasta Cibo with a cream sauce, mushrooms, prosciutto, and green onions. When the waiter took my order, he asked what type of pasta I'd like, which was a pleasant surprise. I opted for fettucini.\n\nMy generous bowl of soup arrived a short while later, along with a delicious freshly baked/warmed roll. The soup reminded me of a cream of mushroom that I once made from scratch years ago. There was a good depth of flavor, and the soup had just a hint of cream. It was perfect for a rainy night, and I had to prevent myself from finishing the whole bowl.\n\nBy then the other diners had departed, so I had the entire restaurant to myself and settled in to decide on plans for my visit to Montreal. After a short wait, my pasta arrived. Even in the low light, I could see a nice yellowness to the pasta. When I asked the waiter later if the pasta had been made in house, he said yes. It had that silky texture but toothsomeness that only comes with homemade pasta. The fettucine, bathed lightly in a rich cream sauce, was studded with chunks of prosciutto, slices of mushrooms, and slivers of green onion. The waiter had offered me some fresh pepper, and it really enhanced the flavors of all the other ingredients. Unfortunately, I was too full to finish the entire pasta--though I gave it a good try--and I also skipped dessert. \n\nAs I surveyed the empty restaurant, I hoped that it was usually far busier. The food was much too good to not have a room full of happy customers enjoying it."
0,"I've had good times at Brothers.  I've had bad times at Brothers.  If you want to know which I've had more of, just look at my rating.\n\nThis place would be remarkably better if it didn't feel like management had only two bartenders working the giant bar on the \""first floor\"" every Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  It gets too crowded to play darts.  It seems like every time I'm here someone does what in my olfactory opinion equates to crapping their pants so then you have to go to the other side of the bar just to avoid it.  Guard your jacket unless you want a free drink spilled on it.  Past 11pm the bathroom resembles a slip and slide.\n\nOn the good side, expect cheap drinks... assuming you're able to order them."
0,"I am absolutely not happy with this location. I just found out I had been lied to multiple times. I have also looked up the most expensive parts dealers for the parts I need and still can't justify the outrageous costs for my parts. I was told control arm bushings for my car could not be replaced separately, that I needed the entire control arms on both sides, found out from three other shops and my father who has been a certified mechanic longer than I've been alive but lives in another state that this was total bullshit. Also found out that they were trying to get me to do a brake system flush with the change of my rear brake pads, flushing the brakes is called bleeding the line. Which is automatic with the changing of brakes. The first time I took them my vehicle, they said I needed a transmission flush so I paid for it, a few days later my light comes back on for the same problem only now it's the transmission solenoid. Luckily my warranty paid for that but my time is just as valuable. I swear they think everyone is stupid and that they can just rip people off! I am one extremely dissatisfied customer and feel like I've been cheated and lied to!!! Oh and to top it all off, found out that not only could the bushings be replaced without replacing the entire control arm, but also found out that they could have lubricated them so they wouldn't split as fast! I will sooner drive to another state before I ever let them touch my vehicle again!!!!"
0,"First of all, the decor is very nice, and the service is great.  But none of that is any good if the food isn't up to par!  And, the food is NOT up to par.  \n\nI ordered the Rock House Farm Artisan Pork, which turned out to be teeny slices of unseasoned chewy pork loin layered with collard greens, some mac and cheese, a cube of fried pork belly with a greasy dab of something they call Arkansas black apple sauce. The collard greens were great, and the mac and cheese were great, but the rest was not worth eating.  All for $27.  Folks, pork loin is not expensive, and should always be tender and bountiful.  And don't give me a cube of fried pork belly and call it braised smokey bacon.  The Arkansas black apple sauce makes me never want to go to Arkansas.\n\nThe two stars are based on the nice decor and excellent service.  But the food was not so great."

The player's winning were taken back! I protested on behalf of the player that she had placed the offered bet BEFORE the dealer turned over, but the pit boss would not deliver the offered bet!\n\nFrom this moment henceforth, I shall never deliver a single dollar unto the MLIFE consortium on account of terrible customer service, taking advantage of inexperienced gamblers, and poor pit boss judgement.\n\nI had been hopeful of the perks of my MLIFE membership, but am now forever forlorn.\n\nG"
0,Don't use this dominos. They are charging 1.35 for Parmesan cheese. And they claim to have no napkins. Please note that I was not asking for extra. I was asking for 1. The white guy that left as I was walking didn't seem to have a problem
0,Do not hire for catering events.... as the food was not bad the service was and is terrible.   I was not only over charge more than the agreed amount contract. . But also the additional labor request was a waste of money... they did not have the Staff bus anything as agreed.  Via email amd text message. We were prepared to hire bus staff from another vendor but they stated they had to have their own team bus the tables and serve.   They didn't do anything.\n\nNow they are not responding to any of the items we have in writing and i will have to bring in our lawyer. \n\nNot worth the headache. And if you saw the mess they call an invoice you would understand why they do not have any kind of business skill other than cooking.\n\nI would suggest using any other BBQ company in town to not have to deal with this chef and his lack of business\n\nOne more thing.. if you do use them be sure to check the math .. as I had to correct it for them during this process
1,"Busy day at the hospital and I needed a drink.  One of the nurses had recommended a new barstaurant that had just opened in the district by GVR.\nTypically this area is aimed for the older demographic but when me and a friend had arrived it was sporting a new crowd.\n\nThe bar is the same area as Al's Garage in that alley by Lucille's.  The restaurant has not had it's grand opening yet but is currently having their soft opening.\n\nUpon arriving to the restaurant you're not greeted by a host/hostess but you simply seat yourself.  Soon after the manager (Brian) who also operates Common wealth and Park on Fremont had greeted us and was very accommodating.  \n\nSoon after our waitress (Sierra) had a arrived and took our drink orders.\n\nSetting: Very modern, english interior.  You feel like you're inside of an exclusive bar because of the dark decor and fancy decorations.  \n\nDrinks:  Madame Victorian arguably one of the best drinks i have ever had (and i've had a few drinks in my lifetime). Nice fruitiness with such an excellent subtle tone of alcohol.  My friend had got the \""When the Smoke settles\"" which was amazingly chocolately and very smooth.  I had two other drinks which were okay.\n\nFood:  I got the burger which was amazing.  The meat was oozing with juices and very tender.  My friend got the fried chicken sliders which were just as tasty.\n\nService:  Friendly management, Our server and busser were always around just in case we needed anything.\n\nOverall: Finally a cool place for the younger crowd to hang out at in Henderson which is pretty hard to find.  No more having to drive all the way down to fremont to enjoy a nice drink with friends.  I would definitely come check this place out."
1,"Get a hammer because you're going to break your freakin' bank at this place, but it's just about worth it. \n\nIf you've dreamt about being encased in a spider web made of crystal, then wake up, baby, because you're here!  This is a three story fantasy surrounded by what has got to be one of the largest chandeliers I've ever seen.  I mean, this thing is larger than Carly Simon's mouth, so you know we're talking huge!\n\nThe setting is cool, the bartenders are knowledgeable and the drinks are legendary.  They have quite a menu of cocktails and even though I'm a loyal beer drinker, I knew that to have ale at such a place could likely be considered a hate crime, so I opted for a cocktail.  My friend and I had an Apple Jack and a Violent Femme.  Both were expertly and lovingly crafted and beyond Delicious.\n\nI can't give it the fifth star because I hate that it takes so long to make each drink and spendy.  So you can just chalk that up to me being impatient and cheap.\n\nThis is the perfect place to sit and have a few cocktails with friends as you people watch seeing the streaming swarm of humanity coming in and out of the Cosmopolitan."
1,"This is our theater of choice in N Scottsdale.  An older theater with no stadium seating, it is still kept in good shape and is clean.  \n\nGreat prices at $5 a ticket before 6:00, it is the best bargain around since they still show all the new releases! \n\nOur main reason for going here it is never crowded and personally I only like sitting next to someone I came with :0). That's never a problem here!!"
0,"About a week ago we spend over 2500 dollars at steinhafels and ordered more than 5 pieces of furniture two bar stools, a kitchen table with 6 chairs, an ottoman , and a nightstand. Today the night stand and the bar stools arrived both damaged. The nightstand had a chunk missing from the top back corner and the bar stools were both missing hardware to assemble them. When I called customer service to inquire about replacing the pieces, the service representative Mary Kay was extremely rude and curt. She told me that a service representative would be available the next day too provide the hardware on the bar stools. Then she refused to give me any sort of timeframe as to when the service man would be able to come by. Apparently their philosophy is that you have all day to sit around and wait for them to repair their shoddy furniture. Mary Kay didn't even ask me specifically how many pieces of hardware were missing from the bar stools so I am expecting the serviceman to come tomorrow without the hardware that he needs to remedy the issue; this is going to lead to more wasted time and we can all agree that time is the most valuable commodity we all have."

Then after an hour of waiting, I called back to see where my order was and another person answers and says that she thought I canceled my order. I said why would she think that, I gave my card info and everything and she said 30 mins. So then I ask when my order will now be delivered and she says that she thinks they don't deliver here. I say ok, but you just delivered here 2 weeks ago so she says well, that was 2 weeks ago-BEYOND astonished at how rude that was!! I told her they really need to get their act together and that that was terrible customer service and hung up. RUDE!"

0,"We had such high hopes.\n\nCafe Zuzu was a huge disappointment today.  The decor was the best part of the meal.  From a lethargic, disinterested waitress to a kitchen staff that required 45 minutes to serve undercooked food to the only table waiting for service in the restaurant, it was just a sad experience for our family.  After waiting 40 minutes, we approached the hostess for help with where our food might be.  Why the hostess?  Because our waitress had become completely invisible.  We looked but could not find her.  \n\nWhen the food did arrive, it came in spurts.  With three people serving, you'd think they could get all the food out at once.  Alas, they could not.  We all had to wait another 10 minutes until the entire party was served. \n\nNow for the food.  We ordered burgers, a sliced turkey dinner and some chicken fingers.  The burgers were the best of the lot, made with an excellent quality beef patty, delicious cheese and a tender bun.  The sliced turkey was god-awful horrid.  It clearly wasn't carved from anything resembling a real bird, but was some type of formed meat buried under a half cup of salty canned gravy.  An assortment of fresh steamed vegetables were the best thing on that plate.\n\nA side serving of mashed potatoes was another miss.  Clearly reconstituted, the potatoes were tasteless and without proper texture.  I've had better when visiting Grandma in the nursing home.\n\nThe organic greens salad was excellent; not so for the torn iceberg salads which could have been made by a three year old.  The onion rings were greasy but good.  The wonderful salted dinner rolls were the hit of the night.  next time I visit Zuzu I may just buy a basket of bread.\n\nNow for the final insult, for some reason, our waitress served us room temperature water without ice.  Who does this?  Why?\n\nThe management tried to make apologies for the kitchen, and we would accept them, if it weren't obvious that the problems with the food and service were not limited to our table.  \n\nWhoever is the manager of Cafe Zuzu, please take note:  you can do so much better.  We came for the wedge salad and great burgers and got \""torn\"" iceberg (it was clearly chopped) and undercooked burgers that arrived cold.  Please, talk to your staff.  They're going to put you out of business if they keep performing like this when you're not in the building.\n\nHope you do better for us next time."
0,"ABSOLUTELY WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER EATEN! My 6-person family went here to eat thinking it would be the newest hottest place to eat in town. It was a failure. We got there at 6:45 for a 7:00 reservation, we then had to wait a full 1 hour and 30 minutes, in the mean time they gave us a \""free\"" appetizer while we waited then proceeded to charge us at the end of the dinner... The food was also horrible, it was cold when we received it and it was poorly made. We were also promised that our drinks would be free because of our major delay which wasn't true either.  Finally, the waitress was extremely rude when our requests were made, making excuses as to why our food was cold or not. Will never be going back to this place, Over priced, terrible food, worse staff, long wait, and a terrible interior."
1,"Patati and Patata is in a prime location on the corner of st Laurent  and Rachel. \nThe poutine has a homemade sauce  that has a sweet like aftertaste. The fresh cut French fries are fried not too crispy but not too soft, in other words, PERFECTION.  With a generous amount of cheese curds, to satisfy any cheese lover.  An important tip is to always get a salad with the poutine, (it's almost the same price) . The salads have a nice variety of greens, its a colorful salad,  orange and yellow peppers, onions, olives,  with a crispy leafy lettuce chopped to bite size.\n\nThe salad also comes With the choice 4 different house dressing, my favorite is the balsamic.\nThe fish filet is made to order, they cook everything right in front of you, on a nice fluffy roll . The filet of sole tasted fresh, moist and succulent. \n\nThere is something to be said about a fish being prepared in front of you also the food is package conveniently for people on the go like myself."
1,"This is the type of restaurant/coffee bar you take somebody whom you want to impress. Liberty Market is modern, stylish, and has excellent food and service to back up the impressive atmosphere. I have in the past driven 30 minutes from my house just to have an iced carmel latte made by these guys. It's just that good. The menu is also inventive and I would highly recommend getting the appetizer pizza to start with hummus on the side. All of the meals are great, and therefore I can't recommend anything above the rest. It's all so good! Be sure to check out the restrooms before you leave, too. Go inside every stall (they are co ed) and be amazed! Four solid stars from this girl!"

0,"We were excited when we heard O'Shea's was coming back so we made a point to visit it new at the Linq.  Well, everything was all fine and dandy until we met this one bartender.  We visited in May and just recently in June.  In may we came in for some shots as a group and met this bartender that initially seemed great...bonded with the group...provided water...so far so good right?  Wrong.  When we get our bills we find that he overcharged us for our shots.  When we pointed it out he was like \""Oh Crap, my bad, I'll have to call the manager to reverse this but it might take a while.\""  Then he asks us if we would rather just have another round of shots to make it even and forgo the hassle....okay fine we ordered another shot each.  Unfortunately when he gave us the shots it was not what we ordered, it was a cheaper shot and he said \""Well these are better anyways\""  Ummmm pretty sure you just charged us for a more expensive shot and gave us the cheapest one you have....We left feeling scammed. \n  Okay, so we try it again in June for my husbands birthday.  More shots.  Lo and Behold we get the SAME bartender and this time I wanted to see if he would do the same schpeal.  Sure enough when he brought my sister in law's change back he was like \""oh! my bad I over charged you...too late now right\""  at this point we were like um no she wants her change.  He then says okay well i'll have to call the manager and it could definitely be a while.  When I mentioned that we had been there a month before, suddenly, he comes back with her change saying that he \""would just eat the difference\""  Trying to make us feel bad ...hmmmmm....yes you will buddy cuz you are scamming people.   At this point we asked for a manager to let them know.  Not sure if some of the other bartenders were in on it or not.  The managers did listen to us and will hopefully fire this one bartender as he is scamming people.  They also offered us a couple free rounds of drinks each for our trouble.  Over all we MIGHT come back to O'sheas because the managers were nice and helpful but if we see that bartender again...NO WAY."
1,"I Love fuku burger!!! every time i have family and friend come over, the first place we try to go to is FUKU BURGER. I have bee eating there since 2010 when I first came back to the United States from being stationed in JAPAN and it is a wild twist. a little mix between style of how food is made in USA/JP. The egg burger combo is zoo good, and that special sauce!!! yeses so good. Can't wait to see them at FOODIE FEST.. definitely hitting them up for sure."
1,"I enjoy supporting local businesses.  Commonwealth Press is no exception.  \n\nA friend bought me one of their Pirates inspired shirts for Christmas and I've resisted the urge to stop by the shop too often because I want to buy all of their t-shirts every time I'm there.  They are uniquely clever with a Pittsburgh flavor.  Some refer to our sports heroes (and losers), some reference our neighborhoods while others just display sayings or pictures that can only be described as Pittsburgh.  I bought what I'm calling the list of bridges shirt that I will proudly wear, both here when I'm out and about but mostly when I'm out of town.  \n\nCommonwealth Press also does custom screen printing, too.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff.  I'll be back for more t-shirts soon."
1,Boris was great and fixed my refrigerator defroster problem.  He was very professional.   The parts came in very fast within 4 days.  I am very pleased with the company.
0,"2.5 stars \n\nI really dont have much to say about this place that others havent already. \n\nI do however know that one day when I went I saw about 5 ppl literally pass out while in line and have to get medical assistance. WTF? no mysters in huge lines? Sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen when someone collapses and could possibly die... \n\nI have never really been one to stand in lines anyway but I did get a season pass none the less, I kinda enjoy the lazy river, although it has no aesthetic value what so ever, but I'm sure in a few yrs the foliage will have grown and it will be a bit nicer. \n\ni do think the kids area is nice, all the kids seem to enjoy it. \nI wish they stayed open later, maybe served beer or something for adults? \nOh and really every time i go, its a high school flashback, there are young high school couple groping eachother at every turn, some really going to far for a public place if you ask me, esp. with little kids around too or high school kids talking about who they are gonna fight next or thier next party... but then again it is summer so its almost to be expected. \nI just still cant believe they dont have mysters... it really blows my mind, so if anyone does have a real good reason why, please tell me so I can stop hating on them for it."
1,"I have avoided Albertson's religiously for years because their prices have consistantly been much higher than any other grocery store. A recent relocation has left me longing for a new grocery store. Unfortunately, Albertson's, along with Fresh and Easy are by far the most convenient to my new digs. I drove a little further to visit the neighborhood Smith's and could not find any parking. I bit the bullet and went to Albertson's. They were busy, but not over crowded and I was able to find parking immediately. To my surprise, their prices seemed to be a little more comparable than I remember. I think they have recently made some major price adjustments, have done away with the \""Albertson's Card\"" and offer the savings to everyone. They are still higher on a lot of items, but there is a lot to be said for convenience. I was impressed by the cleanliness of the store. The produce section is huge and loaded with fresh produce. They have a large selection of beer and wine and a nice meat department. I will definitely return and may consider making this my new home for grocery shopping. In my book, any place that houses a Starbucks deserves a second chance."
1,"In the past, I would have given them 3 stars, but since they renovated the rooms, it's much nicer. Still frustrated that the water slide never seems to be working when we stay here."
0,"ok first I'd like to start off by saying I've eaten here many of times and the food was alright, but this last visit was like I was on another planet! The girl that took our order was very unprofessional and didn't know what she was doing. We ordered simple breakfast foods such as pancakes and scrambled eggs and over easy eggs! Our food came out all wrong there was no over easy eggs and scrambled to this place means omelet style! Next there was no butter for my pancakes so I asked the girl if they had butter and she said for what? I said for my pancakes and she says you eat butter with your pancakes? Wait a minute! What happened to this place? Who doesn't it pancakes without butter, seriously? where was this girl from? what kind of new owners are these? Then in comes this lady who walks straight to the back talking LOUD like she was the owner or something (and I hope she wasn't cause that was just no way to enter this establishment) she comes out from behind with her food already made while customers infront of me were still waiting for there food shes already eating her food! This place is a JOKE! Never going back! Telling all my friends to stay far away from this place! Something went array with this place cause it use to be better service and friendly smiles BEFORE, now you get the sense that even the people who work there are unhappy and very unfriendly who wants that type of service! Cmon owners get your stuff together food and customer service or you will find yourself closing down without any patrons!"
1,"Awesome movie theatre, I come here for the reclining seats and relaxing atmosphere. You must try the hot dogs, their toppings are delish :)"
0,"Ordered here once and I never will again. I ordered chicken Marsala, it was horribly bland. Had absolutely no taste to it and I think they use frozen chicken strips... Also they gave me a rock hard, cold brownie....."
0,"This is one of those places I stop at for convenience. It has a dive bar feel, but on the low end side. It's small and packed from floor to ceiling with all the usual smoke shop stuff and paraphernalia. \n\nPrices are on par with what you would find anywhere else. Staff is helpful and quick to get people in and out."
0,"This was supposed to be a musical review of the famous \""Rat Pack\"" of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis and Joey Bishop that played together in the 1960's. \n\nThere were four male singers dressed and made up to represent the singers BUT their singing was terrible and amateurish. They even forgot the lyrics to several songs and were forced to make up words. The orchestra was off key frequently and I kept wondering why there was an empty front row seat in the brass section. \n\nAll in all it was not a professional show and certainly not worth the ticket price."
1,"Great venue!!! Saw Stevie Wonder there last night. The staff were professional, friendly, and uber generous. You can't always say that about large music venues in California..."
0,This was the worst Buffett I have ever been  to. The sour cream was runny and spoiled..so much so that  it reminded me of seminal fluid expelled from a hobo. The taco shells were broken like my dreams of a good dinner. Nothing was edible and I was given a refund. What's worse is that it was expensive!!! Who would pay for this unless you enjoy punishment ... If that's the case save your money and invest in a domamatrix..it is Vegas after all.
1,"I have waited in line in the freezing rain for this place to open on a Sunday morning, multiple times. Enough said. Try to almond croissant."
1,Bar Louie is awesome they have friendly servers and great food. Wednesday night $1 beers is the best deal in town!
1,Dinner was great.
0,I feel like this place is slightly scammy.  I booked them through Southwedt after a flight.  The had my reservation but quoted me something almost twice as much. $50 something instead of $31. The lady told me I needed to book an extra day with the times I had or risk being charged a $10 late fee and extras. So I did thinking that maybe I put down the wrong times when I booked.  I was able to check it out before I turned the car in and I did not put the wrong times in. Despite the email showing this when I checked out to pay she refused to give me the quoted price because I had already signed on the higher agreed amount. Terrible Customer Service and shady business ethics.
1,"When ever a deli is around, I have to take advantage of the situation and have a bite. Came here for lunch during the 4th of July weekend. I had a BLT and the boyfriend had a pastrami (I think) and watched the Spain v. Paraguay World Cup game. Yummy food. I had to save the second half of my sandwich for later (I was full after the first half!) Great place... Kinda deep inside the casino but worth it!"
0,"Not friendly staff, very overpriced rooms, no view, lousy maid service, and worst was the smell of recycled smokey air from the casino in our room!!!"
0,Duh... what a wasteland of crappy products. Gift card forced me to pop by (in disguise).
0,"Would not recommend.  It is usually a good price due to being off strip, but you are TRAPPED there.  The cabs are virtually non-existent after 5 PM.  Forget going out to a different club or hotel after dark.\n\nRooms are pretty nice for the price - elevators seem to be from the 1930's and take forever - stay on the 1st floor if you want to save time.\n\nDefinitely not worth the money unless you don't have much."
1,"After closing then opening and closing again I wasn't even sure if this place was open. Luckily it was! I worked here when I was 15 it was my very first job and going in brought back alot of good memories ;) \n\nThe lunch buffet runs from 11-2 weekdays and is fairly priced at 6.99 pp. It includes ayce salad bar, pizza and garlic parmesan twists which are deelish. We got there around 1130 so everything was hot and fresh the pizza was great and the twists were amazing as always. They even have cinnamon twists now which is an added bonus like a little sweet treat to finish off the meal. All of the employees were friendly and kept checking on us to make sure things were ok.\n\nAll in all I had a 5 star experience. However their speciality pizzas are pretty damn expensive so I probably would only go back for the lunch buffet as it seems to be the best deal."
0,"We just moved into this area and have eaten here on many occasions,and have had food delivered to my home on a few occasions as well.  Generally speaking the food is ok to good seems pretty fresh, the bread is great, so with that said we are squally pretty happy.  On this occasion I had approximately 20 people at our home for a town hall type meeting with the other home owners in our neighborhood.  After little debate it was decided that we would just order sandwiches from JJ's and ave them delivered.  I call this location.  When the phone was answered n the greeting was yellow please hold.  I had it on speaker and most of the group began to laugh believing it was a terrible way to answer the phone being most of the people here were either business owners or middle to upper level managers.  Five plus minutes past before the person came on the line and asked what can I help you with?  I informed her that I wanted to place an order to be delivered.      She stated \"" ok what is your address\""?  I gave it to her and she then asked \""what do you need I am very busy\"". At this point one member of our party stated she is very Rude, and that we should just go to subway, everyone pretty much disagreed and I began to order.  I started to order one of the 18 sandwiches and 2 lettuce wraps, when I finished she seemed very disturbed and ask if I remembered that she said that she was very busy.  I replied with a yes, and asked if I could get a total please?  She then stated that she was not sure she could fill this order because of its size.  I then stated that t would be no different than if 20 people came in and ordered 20 sandwiches individually.  She than gave me my total and asked for my phone number and my cross streets.  I told her and she then stated that I just wasted her time because that they don't deliver to my address any longer and swore Nader her breath but loud enough for the group to hear her over the speaker of my phone.  Please note that I live just south of cactus as does everyone of the group at my home this evening.  Note:  t is just over one mile to my home.  most people in our group have had food delivered to our homes from JJ's in the past.  Well needless to say the group  went to Subway to get our sandwiches.  Oh and the girl on the Phone stated her name was Jayme and that she was the manager when I asked to speak to the Manager."
1,"Great server, nice and very attentive but not overly so.  The beer I selected was no longer available and she offered the Spotted Cow as something very similar. It was quite nice and complemented my fish and chips. The later was nothing special, I just had an craving for it plus I am departing on Friday. I left stuffed. Two filets along with thick cut fries and coleslaw. Irish music in the background and college basketball on the tube. The dining room was not too crowded for a Wednesday. The bar had most stools occupied with folks that appeared to be regulars. Oh, I nearly forgot the double decker bus parked out front. I forgot to ask when they press it into service."
0,"RIP U OFF!  I went in for an advertised $18 30 minute reflexology masage, and not only did they keep trying to upsell to a 60 minute body massage (and acted like they didn't understand English when I said \""No, just 30 minute Reflexology\"" literally 5 times, the maseuss also called in the \""manager\"" who I had to tell another 3 times \""No, just 30 minute reflexology.\""\n\nIt was the worst massage I have ever received, and at the end the maseuss handed me a bottle of water, like all post massages, and then the manager charged me a $1 for it without asking.  I was very upset by this non-disclosure of charging for the water, I took it off the $2 tip I would have left, and had a total charge of $20.  I just checked my Visa statement, and they added $2.50 after I left.\n\nTHESE PEOPLE ARE CROOKS!! Don't get ripped off too."
1,"Went on my birthday and they gave me my buffet 100%  off (cool). Based on comments from the three other people I was with, they all felt the sushi was decent 3.5 star sushi. Hey, it's a buffet not a hand crafted made for you sushi dinner.\n\nKudos on the vast selection, great service, free birthday meal and a solid 3.5 star meal."
1,"This is my kind of place. Andrea, the owner, has a great selection of wines and she is always so helpful and willing to make suggestions or answer questions.\n\nThey offer tastings on Friday nights and Saturdays after the Farmers' Market. Highly recommended!"
0,"Can they please hire an extra server?  How is it that one lady is the hostess, cashier, and server?  So annoying because the food was good.  Please let's not be cheap and hire more workers."
1,A BURLESQUE DANCER'S DREAM COME TRUE!!\n\nI love this place! It's a must stop when in Vegas. And I LOVE Ellie! What a fabulous look. \n\nTotally a must-see. One of the best costume stores ever with loads of vintage deadstock merch. Yum.
1,"I've always loved cattivo, in that sort of neighborhood bar kind of way. I've never really gone here looking to meet girls, so I can't speak to that, and I tend to drink early and leave before it gets crowded. Maybe that's why I like it so much. The bartenders are nice and the happy hour crew is a good mix. They'll make me a pizza or a calzone with no cheese, and that's kind of a big deal for me. Their dough is my kind of perfect -- crispy on the outside and not greasy, but chewy. Ever since they made the switch to mixed greens instead of iceberg lettuce, the salads have become a meal on their own. I don't come here as much these days (living on the top of the hill and no longer having a girlfriend who lives right across the street), but I sometimes miss those days."
1,"Another great afternoon at Brio. Had friends visiting from California and we all left the table smiling. \n\nAs soon as we entered we were greeted by the GM, got friendly hellos from the bar staff and were greeted by a server in less than a minute after finding a seat\n\nEveryone ordered something different (food and drinks) and there were smiles all round.\n\nCONSISTENTLY good time after time and that's why it's our favorite \""go to\"" place."
0,"We have been coming here for many many years. Every time I go, I ask myself why I keep coming back. The last straw was when my dog cracked his toe nail at home at 7:48 pm. The vet closes at 8 so I called to let them know we were on our way. The receptionist said ok, you have 10 mins. To get there, I drove like a crazy person being that my dog was bleeding like crazy. We arrived at 7:56. After checking us in and putting us in a room, we waited. And waited. Finally after 20 mins the tech came in and said: the doc wanted me to make sure you know there is going to be an emergency vet fee bc it's after 8. My jaw was on the floor. I said No, that's not ok I was here before 8, that's ridiculous. The tech left the room, said she would come back and we waited some more. She never came back. Finally the doc came in and started talking about what he would do about the nail never mentioning the emergency fee. He had my dogs leash wrapped around his hand. I asked about the fee and I said I didn't understand why he would charge us for that as we have 3 dogs and bring them a lot of business. He then began to explain that I was delaying the office being closed and he had to pay his techs OT to stay and....I stopped him right there and told him we were there before 8 and that I don't need him to explain to me how his business is run. He then said, he was considering not charging the fee, but considering the way I was acting, that he was now thinking he would charge it. I asked for my dog back and he refused to give him to me. I had to ask 3 times! I left and will never go back."
0,"I really have to write an update with one star because after going there for the 3rd time, I sense they consistently will have tomatoes and baby corn not looking appealing.  I ate one piece of tomato, and it didn't seemed fresh to me.  I also sense they consistently will bake desserts that doesn't taste good.  The brownies are funky.  However, the cake with the white frosting and reddish color on the dough is good.  As for the wholesale bought ice cream, I love the cookies and cream flavor.  It is so good that I'm willing to line up and ask for it at least 3 times.  \n\nWhat will always be good are the peaches because I believe they are bought in cans.  As for being not worth eating, it is the watermelons because they aren't as sweet as other times I've eaten them whether at home or another restaurant.\n\nIf you are planning to come here, be aware that the seating area/arrangements are not as spacious as I think it should be.  They apparently know what they're doing since people are willing to wait to eat here."
1,This place has really awesome pizza. We had the Chopped Salad and the Gotham Pizza and both were amazing. \n\nThe staff are super friendly and just the right amount of attentive. \n\nI'd recommend this place to anyone.
1,"Love this location, it is nice not to have to go to Home Depot for everything and it is centrally located and the employees all know where everything is so finding things go quickly.  Parking does blow here but I am grateful there is a location here to save me when i need just a little something real quick."
0,"My boyfriend and I went to happy hour on Sunday. They had great deals, and we were excited to try something new. I had a long island, and he got a beer that he had never tried before. It was obvious that he did not like the beer, since he asked me to finish it. \n\nThe bartender came by, and double checked to make sure everything was ok. When he told her he did not like the beer, she was gracious enough to let him order another drink on the house. She was very kind, and friendly with this situation. \n\nWe were both really appreciative and wanted to convey our positive experience to the manager. I told the manager that we were having a great experience and really enjoyed our time. He then proceeded to role his eyes, walk away, and yelled \""Did she pay you to say that\""! \n\nUNACCEPTABLE!!!! I was astonished at how rude he was when I was trying to give him a compliment. I have tried reaching the store owner/general manager with this complaint. I will never give them any of my business every again."
1,"I came here for lunch with my mother-in-law and sister-in-law as the start to a girls' day out. I have been all over the Scottsdale scene, so it's a wonder it took me so long to get around to trying this place out. Let me begin by saying that this cafe is ADORABLE. I can't imagine a cuter lunch place if I tried and I'd come here again and again just for the sweet atmosphere. The service was quick and we were well attended to. My only qualm is that the menu is somewhat limited. There is a giant list of salads with an additional small list of meals that all included goat cheese or brie, which I am not fond of. In the end, I chose a strawberry salad. It was fine, but I don't really like salads, so for all I know it was the greatest salad ever and I just do not have the right palate to judge salads. But lucky for Arcadia Farms, the experience is more important to me than the food itself, and I had a great time. I will most likely return, as I am just totally in love with this beautiful little gem."
0,"First of all, I don't like the name Hilary. There was a fat girl in my primary school class with that name who went around stealing everyone's play pieces but I'll try not let that cloud my judgement.\n\nI came across Hilary's Bazaar the other day my first reaction was \""holy crap, what a rip off\"" and I was shocked to see the price of many of the items here. In comparison to similar shops the price seems to be 10 times as high here with a pair of feather earring being as much as \u00a318. It might not seem that much but they weren't even real silver and looked like something you'd get in a kids gift bag.\n\nMuch of the stock here is just a bit of fun and great for gift ideas, especially the jewellery, purses and other accessories. For me, I just think that some of the prices are way too high for what they are."
0,"This was my first trip to Filibertos and it will also be my last.  While the food was ok (it was ok, nothing more) the service was beyond pathetic and I will be following up with corporate after I finish this post.  \n\nWe got there at 5:50PM tonight (Sunday) and the place was empty except for a car in the drive through.  After waiting several minutes and being ignored by the 5 people behind the counter, somebody finally came to take our order.  Our counter person had difficulty understanding what we were trying to order and then walked away without giving us our drink cups.  I stood at the counter for another 10 minutes while everyone in the back continued to ignore me...one guy walked right past me 5 times a few feet away and actually looked over at me.  FINALLY someone came up and I got our cups.\n\nWhen the food came out my order was wrong.  I ordered the fish taco combo and an additional shrimp tack.  I went back up and tried to get my order fixed but the guy at the counter was arguing with me telling me that I ordered two shrimp tacos.  When I tried to speak with him he suddenly was not able to understand me again.  I asked to speak with the manager, and was told \""no manager, not here\"".  I asked where the manager was and was told \""be back tomorrow.\""  I then said I wanted my money refunded and he said \""no\"" and walked away.  \n\nI'm not sure how they get away with no manager on premises, but that's also a conversation for corporate."
1,"Visited this place with a friend. i used a entertainment coupon for buy one menu item with two drinks and get 1 menu item free. I got the Guacamole Burger with fries. $9.99... The burger tasted much better than the Carl's Jr. Guacamole burger.\n\n The female servers looked good in their 50's style dresses. very hot looking. :)\n\n Fast service and good food. Try this restaurant, you will enjoy the food and the view of the female servers. lol"
1,"You don't want to shop at Tiffany or Cartier . . . you'll get what everyone else gets, even though it's a name brand. A special piece of jewelry should be just that . . . and created for you by someone who \""gets\"" who you are, and gives you the opportunity to play a big part in your own design. \n\nI met Scott, the owner of Addison Taylor Fine Jewelry, through another jeweler who referred me to him for an appraisal of my mother's diamond ring. When I went up in the elevator and rang the doorbell, it hearkened back to the jewelers in NYC or other East Coast metro areas. It was a long time since I rang a buzzer for entry!!! \n\nScott is amazing! He is so welcoming and open. He's a good listener and also a great story teller. He gets to know you and you also get to know him. He asks questions. You immediately feel like he's a part of your family, and you a part of his. Together, we created the most beautiful setting for my mother's diamond ring, and at his suggestion we took the old setting which had ballerina set diamonds and made it look up to date and new by setting it with a large center black diamond. Stunning! His idea! I get so many compliments on both of them. \n\nScott's showroom is full of amazing jewelry, including some extraordinary watches. What he carries runs the gamut, from wallet friendly to off the hook expensive! I am always excited to see what he has in store! He also carries an ample supply of men's jewelry, so don't feel awkward dragging your male friend or significant other to see him . . . believe me, he will not want to leave empty-handed! \n\nWhen you want something special, Addison Taylor Fine Jewelry is the place to go!"
0,"Hot N Juicy you let me down. I have had this place bookmarked FOR-EV-ER and jumped at the chance to go last night when a friend invited me. I got there at 730 and asked for a table for 3, they said 25 minutes wait, no problem. About 8:05 they called my name and sat us in the back in a half booth but it had a square table so it was really akward. A round table would have been much better. Anyways I ordered 1lb of shrimp with the hot n juicy seasoning with a corn and potato and my friends both ordered 1lb of king crab with lemon pepper and juicy cajun seasonings. Right after our server took our order a big party of 15 came in and was seated right next to us and our server tended to them immediately. After about 25 minutes we have had no refills, and we have no food. I start to notice that people who came in AFTER us are getting their food. I joke and say \""I think they forgot about us.\"" We stop a waitress and ask whats going on and she tells us some bullshit lie that our food is coming but that we have the king crab and that can take a little bit longer. Now its been at least 45 minutes and no food. Our server finally comes to our table and tells us she is so sorry and so embarassed but she forgot to put our order in, but she put it in right now and it is being pushed to the front of the line. Now at this point im PISSED off. She was soo worried about serving the table of 15 and just forgot about us. Before we even get our food the table of 15 is already starting to get appetizers. Our food finally came around 9:10 and it was good thats why the 2 stars. The hot n juicy seasoning is delicious but SOO garlicky. I still smell like garlic today. I tried some of my friends lemon pepper crab and that was reallly good. For 2lbs of king crab and 1lb of shrimp our total was like $80 which is not bad. But I will not be back because of the shitty service. I will try the other location a little bit down the street and hope we dont get forgotten about.  FYI the servers  name is ASHLEY, dont get her because she FORGETS everything! Even the people next to us were mad because she forgot to add potatoes and corn to their bag."
1,"Yay! Finally got my lazy butt off the couch to try this place out!! I'm so happy that I did, SO worth the 4.1 mile drive from my house haha, I know you might not think so but that's quite the drive for me to fetch some grub. It's very enjoyable and filling. I ordered the #2 Gyro plate and I highly recommend it. I can't wait to go back and try something else!"
0,"There was not much here at this very small, two-story mall adjacent to Mandalay Bay.  I came here to visit Burger Bar and it seemed to be the prime attraction because it was the only place that was really busy (that being said, it was late morning/early afternoon).  Another worthwhile spot would be RM Seafood, which is run by Top Chef Masters contestant Rick Moonen.\n\nAside from these two restaurants, there was not much in terms of stores.  And a lot of the stores were more gimmick stores.  One of the stores was a sock store, which reminds me of the one at CityWalk.  In terms of shopping, Mandalay Place would be similar to CityWalk (a lot of stores that would not be everyday shopping).  At least Mandalay Place has more well known restaurants."

1,"The Eye Candy Sound Lounge and Bar was a cool laid back alternative than going to a full fledged \""club\"" The vibe is good here and the drinks are strong.  They play a little over everything here but its primarily hip hop.  Age ranges from young 21 year old up to old farts like myself but I would say for the most part its mostly the 25-40 year old crowd here."
0,"Hostess team was weak and disorganized. We had a reservation, restaurant was not at capacity and it was early by Vegas standards.  The delay appeared to be related more to their disorganization than demand or to orchestrate the allure of the restaurant.  I actually witnessed a hostess advise an older patron that she would need to leave her walker at the front door due to space.  Hmmm...how many different levels of dumb does that bring to mind?\n\nThe wait staff was good but we did not have the consistency of 1 server.  That offered confusion and delays at times.  They were all knowledgeable and helpful.\n\nThe food was good but not worth all the effort to get to Caesars.  This was not the experience I expected from Nobu or had at other Nobu restaurants.  I would not recommend or go again when in Vegas."
0,"So when I bought a house in the neighborhood, I was happy to have the local drinking hole McDuffys right across the street to go to for a beer and enjoy some sports. When it closed down I was pretty bummed out, but upon hearing it would be reopening I was excited the area would have a sports bar again.\n\nWhile the beer variety (which appears will be rotating) and the TV selections is great, I really can't figure out what the heck the decision makers are thinking. \n\nFrom my knowledge, Dukes has been open around 2 months and they still can't seem to get signage up on the building and instead have cheap banners that upon night time no one can tell there is anything open from the street short of an \""open\"" sign. The menus are also in poor shape and look like they were intended to be temporary but never bothered to change it. \n\nThey also seem to be having a problem of keeping staff (which explains all the complaints about being understaffed and the help wanted signs). Obviously there is a problem with management or owners that staff (including the cooks) keep not showing up or quitting. I'm not sure how much longer they can survive without making changes needed to keep the place staffed and customers happy.\n\nThe food is a toss up, I suppose depending on who is actually in the kitchen that day. I've had decent food and bad food there. \n\nFinally, if the biker bar thing is true.. I anticipate Dukes falling the way of McDuffys and shutting its doors because of the crowds they are bringing in. I know I'll be bringing my business elsewhere (Zipps, Blue 32, TeakWoods, BWW, all within a close drive) if rather than going to enjoy a beer and some football it's filled with a bunch of bikers. This place is surrounded by residential and schools, a biker bar seems completely out of place.\n\nOnly redeeming part of this place so far has been the bartenders being friendly."
0,"So I finally try this place not because of the hype, not because of word of mouth, but because I had tickets to a show at the Planet Hollywood theater. So with some time to kill, me and the wifey decided to have dinner before the show. \n\nSad to say, I have more negative observations than positive ones so let me get the negative ones out of the way so if you make it to end of this review, then at least you can reflect on some of the positives if you do decide to go here.\n\nFor starters they only have one size sandwich (6 inches) for 5.99. I had to order another sandwich just so I can have that satisfied full feeling. So 12 bucks for a foot long? Sheesh! They only use one kind of bread which is a ciabatta type. It's good but if they had sourdough or wheat it can give whatever choice sandwich you choose a whole nother world of flavor. For their meat whether it's chicken, ham, roast beef, or turkey, they put just enough for you to be able to taste it. Of course you can double the meat for an additional charge. Also don't forget you need a drink to wash it down. So more money out of your wallet. Just do what some people do. They ask for a water cup and fill it with soda. Won't be long before they start charging for that too probably. If you eat here at any time between 12 and 4 am, you're guaranteed to see drunk, fresh from the club, and high people gettin their hungry grub on. I don't know about you guys, but nothing good ever happens between those hours and Earl's is no exception.\n\nSo for the positives. Yes their sandwiches are flavorful, open 24 hours, (which is not always a good thing as described above), and at least you get free refiils on soda. \n\nSo if I just happen to be at Planet Hollywood for some reason and it's not the freaks come out at night period, I will have a sandwich or two if my wallet allows it."
1,"These guys are great.  I'd highly recommend seeing them when you are in Vegas.  They are a fantastic alternative to the overpriced (but worth it) Cirque-du-Soleil shows on the strip.  One of those shows may cost you $120 a ticket.  We got our Penn and Teller tickets for about $60 each.\n\nPenn & Teller are more than just your traditional magicians.  They are exceedingly funny as well, and their show does a graceful job of combining the humor with the magic.  What I love about their show is that they set up many of their acts as if you, the audience, is going to be shown how the trick is actually pulled off.  But in the end, they always throw a curveball and end up pulling off a completely different, even more impressive trick than you were expecting.\n\nI can't say enough about how good this show was.  It is way worth it and probably one of the best values as far as Vegas shows go.  Check it out."
0,"Got here while the band on a Thursday Night was still playing, got seated, placed order for an ice tea and...... \nGame Over? Waitress never came back? WTF? I guess my 6'-2\"" 208# frame just got lost in all the excitement this evening. Or maybe my waitress just sucked. Either way, a bad experience which is a shame because usually the PJ is better than that. I placed my order via the phone and decided to take out instead. No apologizes offered. Won't be coming back to this one anytime soon."
1,"Excellent rotating beer list.  Every time I'm in, there's something new and delicious on tap.  Happy hour food specials are great, tacos are delicious, and burgers are delicious as always.  Happy Dillon is back in the kitchen!"
1,"Well this is spring training facility #8 for me....only 2 left to visit (Mesa and Phoenix Municipal stadium). I know most all of the Spring Training facilities I have visited are fairly small but this one seemed smaller than most. This location is in the middle of Nowhere but that is not unusual because most of these parks are. However this one is quiet....very clean....and very quaint. The atmosphere is definitely not as raucous as other spring training facilities perhaps because the Reds and Indians play here...LOL!!! Despite the Reds success last year and some past success by the Indians there has not been much to cheer about for these 2 franchises in quite awhile. \n\nHowever with that being said it has a very nice team store.....decent food....and friendly staff. So I am sure for those folks who live in Goodyear this is a good ballpark to come to and just enjoy a nice afternoon despite the baseball. If you don't live near here I would go elsewhere because it is not that special enough to make a long drive like I did. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"
0,"How effing dare this place call themselves Mineo's Pizza!  This is nothing more than a typical half-assed Pizza Milano.  Beware locals and travelers alike - this is not to be confused with \""Mineo's Pizza HOUSE\"" located in Squirrel Hill and Mt. Lebanon."
0,It's pretty standard chain. Service leaves A LOT to be desired and you'll definitely find better.\n\nTurnaround is quick though and I don't spend a ton of time in the area so it's a quick go to that's right there.
1,"Really great place, mostly just tried the burgers off their menu. They used to have a Monday special on their burgers, but they discontinued it. Actually haven't been there since, but willing to eat there again. Sad to see the burger special go, their burgers are really good."
1,"Yummy mojitos!  They were packed yet they made room for us...super tasty dinner, cute place, we will go back again and again!"
0,"The employees are sweet and work as a team. But I would NOT recommend going there for ANY of your wedding needs! TRUST ME, she does NOT do business the way it's supposed to be done! You want to talk about getting down to CRUNCH time for your wedding, even if you planned ahead and placed your order wayyyyy in advance, you will NOT get your ordered items until a couple of weeks before your wedding! This lady bashes her employees, asks them to lie to customers about ship dates  *very disappointing*  Not to mention the poor money managing skills.. Who gives checks to their employees and asks them to wait AT LEAST a week to cash them?!?! Or who waits almost a month to give an employee a single check?! I had received 2 paychecks from my current employer before I got my first check from her! You ultimately make the decision of whether or not you want to go through this store, but trust someone who knows what that store is like and how it works behind the scenes. (None of her employees respect her, like her or agree with how she does things)"
1,"Yes, do try Banzo! I was lucky enough to be one of the first people to try this place because of rave reviews from my friend. Been addicted ever since...\n\nI'm in love with their falafel. I always order the F-Bomb platter with chicken because it's never let me down.\n\nThe food cart is available on Library Mall during the week and up at the farmer's market on Saturdays (when the farmer's market is still going that is). They also deliver AND they opened a restaurant at the end of the summer. I will have to stop by their new place next time I am in Madison!"
0,"Was eager to stop in see what the buzz was since it just opened, not sure how well this place will do other than just a bar seen, usually you lower food standards when going to more of a bar place like this, so I did, but even then not so good! I prefer CKs on chandler thier food is much better."
1,"As my cat has gotten older, car rides have become a more fraught and traumatizing experience for her, so when I moved to the other end of town, the drive to her previous vet was untenable. \n\nMy kitty has a chronic condition that they are helping us to manage, so I'm in the office regularly and have found their prices to be very reasonable for both services and for prescriptions.\n\nI feel so fortunate to have found Dr. Hammes and Toni - they are kind, caring and professional.  Appointments are easily booked, they are gentle and thorough and extremely patient with both pets and owners."
0,"I ordered pool lights from this company.  They arrived timely, but they were the wrong size.  I have spent the last 2 weeks sending emails and calling their customer service, but have yet to speak with a live person.  They have ZERO customer service and appear to try to avoid returns at all costs.  I sent the lights back certified and turned my case over to American Express.  I will let them take care of getting my money back.  I konw PoolsAZ received the lights back.\n\nI would avoid this company at all costs.  They have ZERO customer service."
0,"Overpriced and very rude management. I have given this place many chances because I love live jazz but when my friends get charged for tap water or scolded for sitting in the bar area for no reason, I have no desire to come back."
0,"I don't even want to give this boutique one star, but sadly you need to select one. I initially very satisfied with this boutique.  Especially the associate who helped me in the beginning.  The other girls are very snotty.  They don't smile.  And they make you feel like a bother.  \nThe boutique as a whole was nice to me up until I bought my dress, then it all went down hill.  They were making mistakes and not apologizing instead turning the situation around on me, two days before my wedding. \nMy advice is STAY AWAY if you want to be treated with some decency while planning your wedding, because this boutique did not care!"
1,"Came here on a Sunday night during Happy Hour. We were pleasantly greeted and escorted to our table. The hostess informed us we were in time for Happy Hour, so we scanned the menu to see if anything caught our eye. Man oh man is their HH menu extensive!? I was blown away!? We settled on a beer and strawberry margarita. Beer is standard, good as always; as for the margarita, that could be deadly and dangerous. It is so perfectly blended that you cannot taste the tequila. As for munchies, we were given an endless supply of chips, salsa, and refried beans. Yum.\n\nAs for our entrees, they were ridiculously good. We both live in San Diego, so our standard for Mexican food is relatively high, but I would come here in a heartbeat, if in the area again. We ordered a beef chimichanga and a chicken enchilada. Both were delicious and flavorful, especially the chicken. Neither were dry either. The portion was just right too. Not something you would share with someone else; if you took any home, it would be a VERY small amount.\n\nThe service was excellent, above average I would say. The food was spot-on. I hope this place makes it. It's a hidden gem if you are looking for somewhere off the strip to relax and enjoy."
1,"Really good food! Great variety. Not a fan of the crowd it attracts. I'd rather the Aria's buffet that's also great, less expensive, and really only attracts guests of the hotel."
1,"Great spot on the strip. Not to crowded. Not full of hipsters and not full of old people. I was  happy to stay here for my 26th birthday. Table limits are reasonably low compared to some of the other surrounding casinos. When we arrived they asked us if we would like to upgrade for a 15 dollars more a night to a MONACO SUITE and of course we said yes.  It was an amazing suite just renovated with a his and her bathroom. \n\nI love Vegas, being from LA, its just a 4 hour drive or if I want to plan ahead of time 42min flight!    VIVA LAS VEGAS!!"
0,Can't believe how slow the service was on a Sunday at 1pm. Waited 20 minutes for a table and had to remind the hostess about our wait time. Once seated it took an hour for our dishes to arrive. I was not aware it took that long to scramble  eggs... I must be doing it wrong at home.
1,"Is there a a better sport than night golf?  Me thinks not!\n\nKokopelli puts on some awesome night golf parties!  I've read the reviews of people complaining about the course and the grass not being green enough but if you come at night, it won't bother you nearly as much.  The staff is kind and helpful.  I recommend everyone check this out for some fun out of the sun."
1,"This place is unreal.  I was in Phoenix for the weekend and had memories of hanging out with my friend Scott who used to live here.  I got on yelp to find a breakfast place and Scott's popped up.  This is as old school as it gets outside of the Northeast.  The waittresses are awesome, the food is amazing and I really can't say anything that hasn't already been said.\n\nI don't make it to Phoenix much, but anytime I'm in town I'll be visiting Scott's."
1,"Nobu has a wonderful reputation of first class service and amazing dishes. Here to say the Las Vegas restaurant is not exception. They prepare eve thing family style and will create menus to suit your tastes and budget. Sarika guided us through the menus and choices.  Fantastic service. The best dish was the black cod in a miso glaze. Wonderful. My only reservation is that you need to be cognizant of both your food and beverage budget. Outside of that, enjoy the wonderful flavors of the freshest fish in town,"
1,Stumbled on this restaurant for lunch today.    The atmosphere was awesome.  The food was fresh and delicious..even better the prices for lunch were really reasonable.  Definitely going back to try more things off the menu.  I was looking for Seafood noodle soup.  I tried the Vegetarian instead and was not disappointed at all.\nI really reccommend this place.
0,"Okay so Ulta Salon is equivalent to a Super Cuts. Their stylist are a hit and miss on level of skills. \nThe Salon is DIRTY and they use dirty tools on you if you do not stay on top of them. Every time I have been to Ulta Salon there is hair everywhere and I have to ask them to clean just so I can sit or put my purse down. \nThey are expensive for a chain salon, ex. haircut by Jr. stylist $50!\nIf you decide to try them ask for a \""Master Stylist\"" then be very specific as to what you want done and good luck."
0,I went in her yesterday to trade my dads cell phone in after I called customer service and was advised that it was the 14th day and I had to get there before the store closed. I went in and waited 30 minutes . Finally Rory comes over and I explain what I want to do. He immediately tells me its over 14 days its 15 days. He then proceeds to ask his manager if they can make an exception . He comes back and says we can help you . Great! I pick out the iPhone 5c and I am on the edge program. So he starts the transaction and then Rory comes up to me and says because its over 14 days we can not do the exchange you have to pay full price. Then I proceed to say but you said your manager would make the exception . He got very rude and said I did not say that.\nI asked to speak to his manager and he disappeared for 10 minutes and comes back without his manager . Stating there is nothing we can do for. Rory was the worse sales person I ever encountered and will be writing Verizon's Executive Customer Relations. I have never been treated so poorly before in my life. Avoid this store at all costs. Order over the phone.
0,"I broke down and was craving McDonald's and wanted to check out the newly built one. Ordered the new bacon clubhouse burger. It was tasty but on the cooler side of hot. Once again though fries as bad as you can get. Cold, dried out and down right uneatable. I do like that they have coke zero even as it wasn't mixed properly. \nService, what service. No warm welcome or even a smile and it was a manager who was besides himself for having to leave his set position to help me the only customer at noon in line. \nDining room looks great new. Dirty as all hell. Looked to sit at 3 high tables and all the seats had greasy soda spots all over them. \nHow hard is it to manage a place like this. I've done it quiet successfully for many years. \nAnd yes someone can contact me if they'd like."
0,Pretty sad to be called a BBQ place. Brisket looked like baby food. Do not recommend and the wait staff both times I have been there were horrible
1,"I went here the other night on a whim, usually I'm picky about my frozen yogurt because it can be too sweet or not sweet enough. Yogurtology was a perfect match, I got the tart flavor (the worker there said it was very refreshing, I agree!) and kiwi and chocolate toppings. I loved this whole combo and I will be definitely coming back for some more!"
0,This fiesta and the one in Henderson is the worst. Both smells like smoke. My eyes burn because of the smoke. I've been to downtown hotels and my eyes never burn. Wish stations just close down the 2 fiesta properties.
1,Love this drug store. Open 24hrs. Plus they have a 24hr diner.
1,"I have only been one time and I am not the biggest country fan.  But the bar is great and I had a good time.  However, it was empty though I hear it gets pretty packed when a big name country star/band plays there."
1,"Located southwest of Las Vegas along the highway to Pahrump, this is one of two Montana Meat Company restaurants (the other is in northwest Las Vegas). \n\nMontana Meat is co-located with a video-poker bar, and features a separate restaurant area. The kitchen is open 24H, the restaurant area closes at 10 PM on weekdays. The restaurant area is nonsmoking, it's not sealed off from the bar area, this is a showstopper for us at some restaurant/VP bar combos but smoke wasn't a problem the two times we've eaten here.\n\nAt most restaurant/VP bars in Vegas you'd never consider actually eating the food, but, Montana Meat features memorable steaks, and it has a robust selection of salads, non-steak entrees (e.g. lobster tails, lamb chops) as well as sandwiches and other breakfast and lunch items. We had the thick 20 oz Montana ribeye ($26) which comes with a choice of potato, broccoli, and soup or salad. \n\nFull bar. Credit cards."
0,While the selection is decent in the store for a one stop shop of baby gear the service is mediocre at best. Every time I have been in the store my receipt has been inaccurate and takes an extreme amount of time to correct it. An the associates are always very defensive and short when you inquire on pricing. Also note that online prices vary from store prices so you must ask for a price match (which they also won't be happy to give you). Glad my registry is complete so I can find a better store to support.
0,"This casino exudes a sadness that cannot be surmounted by any number of comps.\n\nLiterally, walking through the casino floor en route to the BODIES exhibition caused a sullenness that the much anticipated dissected, respectfully presented cadavers could not surmount."
0,"I purchased carpeting for my nursery from furniture plus. I walked into the store and loved it, it was like a little ma and pa shop and i always like doing business with the underdogs. I worked with a man named CJ, who at the time was very helpful and made me want to do business with him. I left there after receiving a reasonable quote and went to home depot to see what they could do. They price matched me, i went home, thought about it and decided i would rather do business with the smaller company who had offered to install it the very next day\n    I called cj back and paid down the deposit of half the amount due. He then told me he was unable to come the next day due to another job. Well we decided the following wed would work. So i made sure we were home wed bc they were coming between 8-10 am. No call, no nothing. Finally at 11, i called store and they said he was out at another job and he would call me. Finally he got a hold of us and he said the carpet wasnt even in arizona like he sold it to me thinking it was. So we rescheduled for friday between 8-10. Again, no call, no nothing. I once again contacted store and to my surprise, he was at lunch and i spoke with his very polite mother. He returned my call and said, oh it wasnt on the truck again. Lets shoot for the next wed. I will know by tues night for sure if load comes in. Another lovely wed comes and goes and he actually calls me to tell me the carpets not here. Finally the next week, 2 hispanic gentleman show up at my door and say \""carpet install?\"" after i received no forewarning that the carpet was actually here. The workers were very efficient and did a good job, as for cj's customer service, if u are not spending a lot of money, dont expect good communication. But i will say he will be sure to follow up on making certain he gets paid!\n   I hope on the furniture end, their customer service is a lot better than his was. \n\nFrom a disappointed mommy to be"
0,Typical chinese buffet their attempt at serving a lot of seafood for your money's worth  falls short because there are heeps of people lined up like there was a blow out sale for the crab legs.  Once you do get the crab legs they are over salted so you won't want to eat more.  The sushi was super fishy and other entrees dry as they are left out on the heating pad.  The one yummy thing is the mongolian bbq & fried chinese donuts.. but $20 for that? No thanks.
1,"This is my go-to Chinese place. Super-fast delivery, solid staples for a typical Chinese place. \n\nBy far the best part of ordering China Wok is the phone call. I once dreaded the sharp orders coming through the other line, but I've come to appreciate the humor and adventure in successfully placing an order. Just make sure you check the menu first before you call. If you hesitate on the phone, watch out! (It's awesome)"
1,"IF YOU'RE EVER IN VEGAS, YOU MUST GO HERE. You will regret it if you don't! I heard this as well prior to my first visit, and pondered the same thing, \""What's so great about raw oysters?\"" But aha! It's not only raw oysters, but it's their freakin' PAN ROAST.\n\nSfjalfjsldfsakfjsakfjdsalfjas --- That is what comes to mind; just mind-blowing that nothing can describe how delicious it is!  \n\nI ordered the House Pan Roast with noodles at level 7 spiciness.  In case you don't know (cause I didn't), the house pan roast is a bisque-like concoction filled with crab, shrimp, chicken, and sausage.  Super savory, buttery, and total hearty goodness.  The chef would cook your food right in front of you in broilers and dumps it into your bowl!\n\nCons:\n- It only seats about 15 people, so be prepared to wait. We waited for an hour. The long wait is due to people eating hot/spicy food, which takes more time to consume.\n\n- Our chef was totally testy.  A couple of Yelpers mentioned this too and as well the patrons sitting next to us who go there often. The chef is a young, thin woman who never smiles. Apparently the awesome chef is a male one with facial hair who makes convos w/eaters and jokes around.  He was just getting off his shift the moment we sat. \n\nOur server, who seemed sweet, got carried away flirting with a group of boys and overlooked us girls who got sat first. She took their order first, and it was an honest oversight. When she saw us, she felt bad and quickly took our order. She reassured us that our food will be cooked before those guys. And we told her to not sweat it. But then the chef snidely says, \""It's all gonna be done the same time.\""  Geez chef lady, the server felt bad, she was making amends to us, why would you do that?\n\nAll in all, despite the cons of the long wait time and possibility of a not-up-to-par chef, the Oyster Bar gets 5 stars for providing such an extraordinary dish!\n\nTIPS: One pan roast for 2 people is plenty! So share and save your money :) And get noodles instead of rice; hey, or both on the side even!\n\nNow where can I get pan roast in Orange County, CA?!"
0,"We walked out which puts this play in the same category as the only other play where we left early, Cats. I have a dry sense of humor and a quick wit, but I can't say that this play was remotely funny. Jokes were predictable, repetitive, and the music was shrill."
1,"two words...buffalo calamari.  went here after the niners/cardinals monday night game to kill time and avoid traffic.  the buffalo calamari was great!  we actually ordered it again after we ravaged the first serving...ordered the luigi, basically a cheesesteak...bread was good, meat and veggies were great, and the hot sauce was good...live dj playing some great music ranging from old school ll cool j to some bay hyphy shit...the music might be something special only for football nights or maybe just friday and saturday.  servers were great and easy on the eyes except for an emo looking one that you could tell that she cuts herself on breaks...a must eat if ever in the westgate area for either a football or hockey game..."
0,"Fuuuuuuuuuuck this place. I go every year for mayhem but I doubt I'll go back. 4.50 for a bottle of water. In Arizona, in the summer, that's criminal behavior. Security will make you sit up if you lie down on the grass, but they'll ignore the woman who's so drunk she can't hold herself up with her eyes are rolling in the back of her head. Makes sense. VIP is a joke. It's a bar. And a bathroom. And the prices are the same as general admission. Not to mention the parking situation. I needed handicap parking. No one seemed to know where I should go and the only apparently available area was being saved for employees. Guess everyone forgot to mention the ENTIRE OTHER SIDE OF HANDICAP PARKING. I ended up parking at the back of the lot. Uninformed employees. Asshole security. Ridiculous prices."
1,I love this place !! This was practically the highlight of my trip to Vegas . They give you a variety of bread but their bread didn't really impress me . The oysters were alright but didn't really impress me either . I had the bone-in filet mignon which was absolutely heavenly !! It was so yummy and literally melted in my mouth !! Their filet mignon is perfect ... the best I ever had !! The cream of corn made the perfect side . It was very delicious . They also carry white muscat wine which was good . It came out to be about $100 per person with the muscat wine including tip but it was totally worth it . I will definitely be back here again the next time I am in Vegas !
0,"Good chinese takeout here, seems to be hard to find.  This is the Hoho Cherry House.  The Hoho China Bistro is no more, but I heard it moved here.\n\nThe lunch specials are a good value, but the food here is right about average.  General Tso's is OK.  This is more along the lines of a Panda Express, but mom and pop owned.  For that, I expected more.  Nothing to rave about, but not terrible either."
1,"I was in Mesa for business and had a craving for tacos. The location does not scream delicious as it is a little hole-in-the-wall, but the food is awesome. \n\nI ordered a couple tacos al pastor and a couple shrimp tacos. The al pastor tacos were pretty good, but the definite standout were the shrimp tacos. The tacos came with a cabbage salad and a creamy sauce that both added greatly to the success of the dish.  The shrimp was succulent and not dry in the least.  After finishing eating, I wish I would have skipped the tacos al pastor and just gotten another shrimp taco \n\nIf you have a craving for Mexican food I highly recommend trying out the restaurant.  I went on a Friday night and it was pretty packed so the food took 10-15 minutes to come out, but it was well worth the wait."
1,"Although I had heard about the Hollywood theatre before (rumor is you can rent it out for parties at a very reasonable fee), I had never been. A friend recentlyy went on a food tour of Dormont and discovered that they have a breakfast and movie day. When I heard they were playing It's a Wonderful Life (best Christmas movie ever made!), I HAD to get tickets. Christmas season does not officially begin for me until I've seen It's a Wonderful Life. What better way to view a classic than a beautifully restored classic theatre. I signed up through their website. Tickets were $15 including both the movie and breakfast. The breakfast/brunch was provided by the chef of the former Sugar Cafe. Another favorite of mine that I was so sad to see go. \nWe arrived at 11 but luckily our friends had arrived a little early in order to save the awesome comfy chairs and love seat with tables in the back of the theatre. Perfect set up for brunch. A few minutes later brunch was served. Oh what a spread! Muffins, scones, fruit, quiche, potatoes. I tried a little of it all. So glad that the Sugar Cafe lives on in spirit (and food). This stuff is too good to be locked away in someone's kitchen. We had half an hour to eat before the movie started. Classic cartoons were playing as we ate. Shhhh! It's starting. Ahh, time to sit back, relax and enjoy the show. Popcorn and sodas were available to purchase for those who needed the true movie experience. Stomachs full and hearts warmed, we left the theatre ready for all the Christmas merriment headed our way. Next stop, breakfast and White Christmas."
1,"I ate lunch here today and it was really fantastic! Besides an extensive regular menu, Tonto has a vegan and gluten free menu...yummmm. I started with the caprese salad which had three fresh mozzarellas (ancho chili, sage, hibiscus) made on site paired with three thick slices of heirloom tomato and micro sage. My cousin suggested their spaghetti squash (a side) to share and it was delicious! It is seasoned with grilled onion and tossed with wilted spinach...so good! My meal was a torta with layers of mashed anasazi beans, green chiles, chopped tomatoes, mashed sweet potatoes and a bunch of other stuff and was accompanied by whole grain baked crackers. It was a great blend of textures in the torta and all the flavors mixed seamlessly. My cousin had an ahi tuna roll that looked like it had been covered in tempura - she loved it. \n\nThe flavors of everything we tried really stood out. I would go back in a second!"
0,"Okay. Disregard anything else previously said. Driving in and around this airport is a N-I-G-H-T-M-A-R-E. Strange ramps that lead you in circles, easily missed turns, etc. Trust me, I've been compared to a human version of Google Maps, and getting lost is a once in a blue moon experience for me, but this airport has continually duped me. Looking for Terminal 2? Good luck."
1,"I have never had a manicure before. \n\nI was feeling like I really needed to get my nails taken care of today and I have seriously been considering dipping my fingers into the manicure world. I just so happened to be on the Westside of town going out of my way to visit a few places I've been meaning to get to. So, as I was driving down Durango I decided to look for a nail salon. I happened upon More Than Nails, read Yelp reviews and decided hey why not!\n\nI was a walk-in on a Wednesday morning (about 10:45 AM) and there were two patrons and three people working. I was greeted and asked what I would like. Well, considering I'm a newbie I just stated I wanted a manicure. I was directed to select a nail color from the wall. I picked a pretty dark pink with a slight shimmer from OPI and was lead to start my manicure.\n\nIt was very pleasant and there was a movie playing overhead that I watched. The lady doing my nails was not very talkative, but very meticulous and nice. She seemed surprised I had never had a manicure done before.\n\nAt the end I had a bit of a surprise, my manicure had only cost $12 and in order to use a card here you must purchase a minimum of $15. I was pretty flabbergasted  and asked if there was anything I could purchase to push the amount of money up. Luckily they were able to issue me a $3 gift certificate. So, with my GC I plan to go back for a mani-pedi and I will make an appointment this time. \n\nOverall it was very nice. I am a newbie to all this, but I think my first experience was great. By the way, they offer a 10% discount for checking in on Yelp! I will partake of this offer later when I spend a bit more than $12!"
1,"This place was on my restaurant list! According to Bon Appetit Magazine the best ribs in America are at 17th Street Bar & Grill in BFE small towns in Illinois. However, the owner Mike Mills opened several restaurants in the west coast, Las Vegas to be specific...He names these Memphis Championship Barbeque (though he could not name them 17th Street Bar & Grill because they were not on 17th Street, LOL).\nNOTE: This is memphis style barbeque so don't expect thick sauces or bones falling out expect some delicious barbeque! Expect pork that been rubbed down with \""magic dust\"" and has been slowly smoked forever! The meat is tender and has absorbed all the natural juices of the meat....As I type this my mouth waters! The sides are very good as well! We have amazing service, and babyback ribs to die for!!! If you find yourself in Vegas make sure you stop at Memphis Championship Barbeque!"
1,"The dark chocolate milkshake is arguably the best milkshake I have ever had in my life.  The waffles were also great and the fondue was good.  The Sweet Chocolate Experience, meant for two, was huge. \n\nThe menu is big and diverse with an impressive selection of chocolates.  They also have several items of regular non-chocolate food as well.  The service was good and the staff was knowledgeable."
1,"This place is amazing! I catered from here for my company and everyone loved it. At first people were hesistant because they thought it was going to be just salads but they have so many other delicious things on their menu! Their dressings are amazing and they put a lot of meet on the salads. My boyfriend also tried the tilapia wrap and pan fried noodles and was in love with both! If you want to eat somewhere affordable and healthy, definitly try this place out :)"
0,I had my coffee table on consignment and it sold 3 months ago. I never got the check and finally had to come in there and see what was going on. They said they would have to talk to there accountant. There is no accountant to talk to but they will email them for me. I can't believe that this is going on. My next move is bbb.
0,"Absolute worst service over phone. Called once, Guy said \"" hello\"", I said \""Hello\"" back. He immediately hung up. \n\nCalled back, he just said hello again, same voice, acted put out talking to me, barely answered my questions and then hung up. \n\nTrying another store instead. Why does Verizon allow people to stay employed like this. Plenty of nice people want jobs."
0,Not worth the trip out of the strip
1,"Very nice place close to our Time Share. Staff was very nice and extra attentive. All the sides/salads were very good. Was not a fan of the Lobster Bisque personally. The meats had quite a selection, but the flank steak seemed to make the most appearances. Next time we will ask for the better cuts to come by more often if we don't see them, now that we have a lay of the land. See ya definitely the next time we are in Las Vegas at our Time share."
0,"went here with friends because it's supposed to be great sushi so I thought we'd try it out. wait was long, they need a bigger place in my opinion because it gets too packed in there. sat at the sushi bar. chefs were cool and were open to substitutions and deletions of items I didn't like.\n\nsushi was good but not even close to the best i've had which i'll be reviewing soon. \n\nhere's the problem..**** Food Poisoning!!! *** me and my friend were crazy crazy sick from the sushi (all you can eat). I've never had food poisoning in my life, believe me you don't want it! needless to say Never again will I go to this place."
0,"We went last year & again this year but were thoroughly disappointed with the festival this go around. Last year there was an actual salsa tasting competition, which was awesome, plus you were able to buy jars of salsa as well. This year the only salsa we saw was from Jo Bot & it was just a little plastic cup with no chips, sweet I love shooting salsa. Otherwise the beers were ok, if you like deschutes beer, the margarita was good. But the main thing is that it cost more this year just to get in & there was not a sample in sight you didn't have to pay for, there were fewer vendors & overall I just didn't feel it was worth the time or the money. The salsa tasting was the best thing they had going & without that it's just another excuse to charge people money to stand in an empty dirt lot with not much to do. Get your shit together chili fest or else I'm afraid this fall festival is DOA."
1,"I still love this joint! But hey, it's Caesars Place! It was built in 1966 and still holds it's own. Just go there and enjoy everything."
1,"I love this place. I always get the Carne Asada California burrito. It is so good, it has so many different flavors wrapped into a burrito. Until I started my semi-health kick (I know how can I be on a health kick and eat fast-food Mexican food?) I used to also get their breakfast burritos. Their Damn good too! In the mornings, on a Sunday, this place just gets tons of over the phone orders, so expect a longer wait. Years ago my friend recommended this place, only it was on Chandler and Dobson. \n\nI like to think of \""Los Favs\"" as a less greasy and cheaper version of Filibertos (though that may not be true)."
1,"This is an automatic stop for family every-time we are staying at the Palazzo.  We come here for lunch or a quick hot noodles fix after a late night drinking. Their noodle  soup are very tasty and delicious which always hit the spot.  Love the fact they close late at 3am.  This was our first stop after checking in the hotel so will definitely be back after drinking tonight.  They also have Pho but soup base seems a watered down and not the best out there.  Some of my favorites includes Shrimp Fried Rice, Beef Congee and the Duck Noodle Soup."
1,"My wife got her water pump on her PT Cruiser fixed here. We shopped around and the prices here were competitive. The staff was nice. We got our car back a couple hours then initially anticipated, but all in all we were happy with Doctor Auto."
0,"I have driven by here on my way to work every single day and always wanted to try it.  Finally tried it this week.  I really really really wanted to like it.  It looked different with a cool vibe to it that I thought my family and I would enjoy.  I cant complain about the service.  They treated us great and the food came out quickly.  The food however disappointed us.  My son had a burger which was incredibly dry.  For him to leave a burger half eaten told us something since he's usually a vacuum cleaner when it comes to food.  My wife's fish tacos were also really really dry.  Her squash casserole was really really bad.  I had a taste and needed to down it with water in order avoid gagging.  No joke.  My plate was fine but nothing great.  Not bad, but not great either.  I had a seafood creole platter.  All in all, I hate to say we probably wont be coming back for seconds."
0,"I want to say, before I embark on this journey of writing this review, I am not a gambler, nor will I ever be due to my ill fated luck with the whole ordeal.\n\nAnyway, I do not hold this casino in high esteem. Granted, I have only been there once. Although the casino is extremely spacious, and other people have vouched for the above average quality of the food (I didn't get the chance to eat it), I disliked it.\n\nWhy, you ask? Ladies and gentlemen, it is because of the extremely rude service. When I entered the casino, I was stumbling, because I am a woman, I am tired, and I am wearing three inch heels. After a night of dancing and debauchery, I should be allowed to feel a little bit of exhaustion. If I didn't, then I would have been labeled as a drug abuser.\n\nWhen I showed the bouncer my ID, he made rude inquiries. He asked me why I was stumbling, and I calmly told him I was wearing heels that hurt my feet. He then proceeded to ask me why, and I quipped that I went to a club, and I felt like it. He definitely thought I was a hazard to the safety of the casino.\n\nThe rest of the night was a blur. I had a bad taste in my mouth after he called in some other staff through his radio transmitter. My friends didn't enjoy it, point blank. \n\nMaybe next time, I will be treated better. \n\nIf not, there's always Gila River Casino."
0,"Hmm: Not quite sure what to say.\n\nVacant filthy lots next to the hotel (pics to follow) \n\nTrain blowing it's horn as we were trying to relax.  Yes people it blew it's horn several times.  The train tracks were located out the side of our hotel.\n\nNice view of the strip clubs across the filthy lot before the train tracks.\n\nWhat??? No casino!!!! Mr. Trump, what's a girl to do? Had to walk on over to The Wynn.\n\nThe room was nice and the lobby clean (somewhat gaudy)\n\nFashion Mall across the street. (definitely a star)\n\nJust want to say to the guy at the information booth: \""You rambled on and on for 15 minutes about us being too late to catch our flight.  I was trying to be polite and smile but in my head I was thinking \""SHUTUP ALREADY AND GET US A TAXI\"" All that talking about how you had missed your flight and there was no way we would make ours.  Guess what?? \""WE MADE IT\"" even after you being so negative! That my dear just lost you another star!"
0,Horrible food!! Crab legs had a funny smell and weren't fresh. Definitely not worth $15.99. If you know what great food tastes like do not waist your money here: (
1,"I would give a 4.5, but it won't let me! Nice hotel, friendly staff, affordable gambling, great food at suede, Starbucks open 24 hours. Only weird thing was the weird smells when walking across the main floors."
1,"This place is so much better than I expected! \n\nI order a juicy lucy, which held true to it's name. Great flavor and cooked perfectly. I also had the sweet potato fries which came with some sort of honey mustard. It complimented the fries well.\n\nI sat at the bar, which is nice and quiet. It has a couple of flat screens and slots if you're into that. \n\nThe only drawback would be the price. I paid around $18 for my burger and fries. Kind of a lot when you think of what you can get at MCDs.\n\nMy favs are still in n out and burger bar, but this is a close third. Highly recommended. I'll be back!"
1,"By far the best Todai I have ever been to. Love their poke. So fresh and the taste remained the same even after many months since I got to taste them again. Many different sushi to choose from and of course my favorite crab legs, that alone will definitely make me come back every time I am in Vegas.\n\nThere is a good selection of soups and dessert. Did I mention fresh made crepes where you can choose from fruits, chocolate, nuts and caramel stuffing or topping? Don't forget the green tea ice cream, and if you are not so much into the exotic flavor then there's vanilla.\n\nWhat's cool is you can walk off the calories after through the Miracle Mile shops."
1,"Super great atmosphere and d\u00e9cor. We got the grilled fish, fried fish, and shrimp street tacos. SO GOOD and filling. I had the Hot Mango margarita... Ok actually like four because they were that good. I can't wait to come back here"
1,"So far, this is the best middle eastern I've tried in Charlotte.  I ordered the veggie plate where I had a choice of 4 different veggie items listed.  I ordered hummus, baba ganouj, grape leaves, and falafel.  They were all delicious.  Be sure to ask for some garlic sauce.  It makes all the difference.\n\nThis is also a small grocery store so I purchased some feta cheese.  OMG.  It was so salty and different from what I get at a restaurant.  \n\nFriendly service and friendly place."
0,"My experience at LIFE was just terrible. First off I was staying at the SLS for my birthday with my two best friends and the concierge arranged for the 3 of us to get in without a cover charge and a couple complimentary drinks as long as we would get to the club by 11pm; I thought it was a really nice gesture since we were already having some problems with the staying itself. We got there at 10:30pm it was a completely mess we first got in the VIP line and they told us to go to a different line because we only had our names in the guest list. well the other line consisted of a bunch of people pile all together by the bouncer after waiting for 45 minutes our promoter got us in to the next line where we would get ID checked that's when the hostess came in and said I had to pay 55 bucks to go in I told her about what concierge told me and she told me she couldn't honor it because it was pass 11pm. I would be totally cool if I had got there after 11pm but I did not and I told her so, she called the \""door manager\"" that btw was the exactly same guy I talked to at 10:30 in the first line he did recognized me and said yes you got here before 11 but is 11 now and I CAN'T DO NOTHING. I went over again about being a LUX guest at the hotel and it was my birthday and at the top of it he knew I was there on time, nothing happenned and I ended up going to Hakkasan where I did not pay to get even without guest list and ended up getting a deal on a bottle service and Tiesto was just great. I want to say that it wasn't about the money but it was about bad service and total disrespect with me and my friends as guest."
0,"I am actually appalled at how horrible this hotel's customer service is. I checked in at 9pm. My room was dirty with pancake, towels & sheets all over the floor. I called front desk and all they offered me was a $20 room credit. Then!, the next morning we left at 8am and did not return until 7pm and the room had not been turned down. We called cleaning service and was told there was nothing they could do. Truly the worst trip of my life. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone. You are better off staying at a motel."
1,"Saturday 5:15 pm. Our first time here. Service prompt, very polite. Servers checked on us as a team, no complaints at all! Food all came out in good timing. \n\nEgg rolls delicious, very crisp, fresh inside, not greasy. Chicken wings... tried them only b/c of the Yelp comments... They really are that good, nice & crispy, & the sauce that comes on the side is addictive! Thom Kha soup FANTASTIC, chose chicken in it, & as others mentioned, this places uses great white meat!  We both ordered Thai iced tea, sweet but not overly sugared. Then switched to hot tea which was unsweetened & surprisingly delicious in flavor, what the heck?! \n\nOur appetizers were so shockingly fresh & good that we skipped an entree & simply ordered another round of wings & egg rolls.\n\nWE WILL BE BACK!"
1,"At first I didn't really like the menu, but temptation grew every time I drove by. So finally, I stumbled in today after stopping by my job to grab something quick and I decided to get a Shortboard Combo (5\"" Shorty with ham, turkey, or roast beef; a drink; and a choice of a side for $6.45). I also added shredded mozzarella and thousand island for a bit more, but nothing too steep.\n\nThe sandwich was awesome! Granted, there was no way to mess up a sandwich of this caliber, but it still satisfied my taste buds. This is my new favorite place to grab a sandwich and I'll definitely be going back more. I just got the rewards card so it will be worth it even more.\n\nI must say that I also love the decor. A surf-themed sandwich shop in the middle of a desert. Very refreshing to the constant desert palms and what not.\n\nIf you enjoy it that much, they also sell shirts, hats, keychains, and necklaces for varying prices.\n\nI'll probably try the Charley Tuna or the Pastrami Nami next."
1,"I remember driving down Spring Mountain and seeing the sign for Yu Yu Kushi-Age, and getting very excited.  Vegas can totally use a kushi restaurant!  And then I learned that Kushi-age meant that everything was deep fried skewers...that scaled back my excitement a bit.  Do I really need all of my food deep fried?  If it's being deep fried with Yu-Yu's panko breading, then the answer is yes.\n\nDeep fried veggies?  Deep fried beef?  Deep fried fish?  Yep, all the skewers are deep fried.  The panko breading is not too heavy, and goes well with anything it covers, such as: quail egg, sausage, asparagus, chicken wing (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yu-yu-las-vegas?select=6j2wuzaV4nF9TcfMgAWbGw#6j2wuzaV4nF9TcfMgAWbGw), salmon, scallop, sea bass, beef tongue (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yu-yu-las-vegas?select=v7Vk2ExC0fPh8Kvr6hHWLA#v7Vk2ExC0fPh8Kvr6hHWLA).  In addition to the various skewers I've tried, I also have had the curry udon and uni chazuke.  The curry udon is very good, and is a big enough portion to share with two-three people; otherwise it is a meal in itself.  The uni chazuke is a bowl of rice in a green tea broth, with a shio leaf and uni on top.  It was decent, but not really something that I would order again.\n\nSitting at the bar is a treat, as you get to watch the chefs prepare each skewer and fry them.  I would say that sitting at the bar is the preferred way of dining, so that you get your skewers as they are cooked.  If you would prefer a bit more privacy, there are many tables throughout the elegant restaurant.  No tacky decorations or obnoxious decor, this is a nice place to enjoy a meal.  Skewers range from $1 - $3, and entree dishes are in the $7 - $10 range.  It seems there's a good variety on the menu, and I'm already looking forward to going back to try more of it.  Totally a fan!"
0,"I have lived next to Gallo Blanco for over 2 years. I call in pick up orders often.  The only reason I go back is the food is good and it's the closet place I can walk to.  Other than that everything else is poor.  The waiter and bartenders all have poor attitudes.  I won't order drinks at the bar because in the 2 years of coming it seems like all of them have an attitude.  I have witnessed bickering and arguments behind the bar between staff. This past Thursday I order a burro around 945pm.  When I got home it was cold, some of the meat wasn't fully cooked, and you can tell the prepping was rush the way things were cut.  This is the first time I experienced bad food here.  So I called and left a message on the voice mail for management stating my recipient number and issue.  I am yet to get a call back.  I have been in her many times and witnessed other complain about their experience and it doesn't seem like management cares.  This place would have more local traffic but everyone on my building has had a bad experience.  I would love to talk to a Manger again.  I did speak to one months ago about the bad experience but obviously things haven't changed."
0,"ah.... NO.\n\nif you want cheap crap, by all means, shop here.\n\nFor hard liquor, I have almost always and consistanly found stores like safeway less, (for their sales AND extra 10% off 6+ bottles).  Then they (BevMo) tells me, \""well,\""we'll match\"".....  (OK, why would I be here if I already didn't find {and buy} the discount items?)\n\nFor stoli, grey goose, pravda, chambord, saphire, ect., ect., ect. I find I almost always find those higher end items on sale PLUS 10% off at albersons or safeway.\n\nFor cheap wine, (and i mean cheap) especially buy 1-get-1 10 cents, go ahead (i'll serve that to my older relatives who are more than happy with it.  For the high end wine - OMG - they are 10-30% MORE than other places I've found. (ck out Phoenix wine, btw - across the street).\n\nBTW, this is not based on just 1 visit - i live near-by & really try to support my local people, honestly.... but not to the point of getting ripped off!  They appar to have warehouse prices, but I have not found this to be true.  So of COURSE I will go aross the street to other more honest, happy, attentive and service orientated local business who puts a smile on their face when they see me."
1,I stayed here during the summer really enjoyed it. Got the cheapest room and it was HUGE! Centrally located which was nice right next to the mall! I would definitly stay here again!
1,"I love this Petsmart!\n\nIt's in a great, convenient location with plenty of parking.  I can pop in here while I'm doing shopping everywhere else so it is not out of my way.  The store is always uber clean so I don't feel bad about bringin the ole' pup here.  You know, you've been into stores where you don't want your own dog touching things. Sick. \n\nThe staff is incredible here!  I've been here a million times and they're all super friendly and helpful.  I swear they all know what's up in this place.  Fleas? No problem.  Dog outfit?  Funny, I'm actually a personal shopper for pets.  Bath soap?  Allow me to show you where that is.  Pet hotel? HA! We have that in the back. \n\nThis is a great spot to go for your pet and they always have really cute seasonal outfits.  \n\n\nOh, and don't forget....when checking out make sure you donate to the homeless pets! :)"
1,"to visit vegas twice in less than 3 months is impressive. \nto stay for at least a week's time during each visit is painful.\n\nthank you to venetian for making both of my work trips bearable.\n\nfrom the all suites rooms to the various pools, from the shops (think palazzo and canal shoppes) to the award winning restaurants (think mario batali and wolfgang puck), from the gambling to the shows (loved jersey boys), venetian made me alittle happier while in vegas.\n\non my last day in vegas, the bf and i decided to do an early morning jog along the strip. we ran from the venetian to the new york new york hotel. while it was still hot at 8:30am, there wasn't much pedestrian traffic. however, we did run into a lady that was trying to hustle us to watch a show near the MGM. this was part of our conversation:\n\nrandom lady: \""hi are you guys married?\""\nus: \""nope\""\nrandom lady: \""oh, are you guys just living together then?\""\nus: \""nope\""\nrandom lady: \""ok..(long pause) well then that explains why you guys are so damn happy!\""\nus: (laughing our asses off)\n\nwe definitely got a good laugh on that one. i guess you just never know what to expect (or hear) when you're in vegas!"
1,This place is AMAZING!  It is exactly what I look for when I want to eat out.  Wonderful family owned place!  We had the Stromboli.  The dough was light and baked to perfection.  The tomato sauce was just like my grandmother's sauce.  Lovely owners as well.  I am going back on Friday with more people so we can order pizzas!  I can't wait!
0,"I was here on Monday night for my moms birthday dinner. I had ordered a chicken salad and when it was brought out there was hardly any chicken on it, no croutons, no egg, and no onion. It looked like it might have been dropped. When the expo brought it out she had said that they were making more chicken for me because there was a \""casualty\"". Then our sever came back out and I told him what my salad was missing. He then said that they were just going to remake the whole salad and he then took my dropped salad back. \n\nDefinitely seems like they had dropped my food and they were going to let me eat it."
1,"Thank you Lee Lee's for opening up on the west side!\nI can now find all of my beloved Thai ingredients right here! This store is divided in sections. Thai here, Japenese there...you get the picture. The produce section is great too! Kaffir lime leaves, lemon grass, galangal, thai chili..its all here!\nI went opening weekend and they gave me a 10% discount card that I can use everytime I am there. Not sure if they are still being offered, but you can give it a shot and ask the cashier."
0,"I have never had good luck with this company.  Though deliveries occasionally show up, they frequently lie about the status of shipments.  More than once they have claimed to have attempted delivery when someone was at home (and they left no tag at the door.)  They have also claimed to not be able to find addresses in San Francisco.  (GPS?  Any number of online map services? Ask someone on the street?)  I also suspect that the 5-star review is an inside job.  This company needs to be put out of business."
1,"Great burgers.  Truffle fries was only so so.  Pork belly buns was an inventive and delicious play on the traditional duck buns.  Will come back for some solid creative burgers, but not sure about the truffle fries...may improve with more truffle."
0,"Don't bother eating here. A 50% off coupon for a $10 buffet should have raised a red flag, but we were starving && wanted something quick. Everything had a bit of a stale air to it...nothing looked, or tasted, fresh. The catfish was overcooked and very muddy tasting, almost masking the taste of freezer burn. The ribs were cold && covered in fat. The hush puppies just tasted...off. The other baked fish came in weird, thick sauces && the egg rolls were mushy on the inside? The only things that were good were the mashed potatoes && salad. There are other, much better, choices in the hotel."
1,I am originally from South Jersey and we have these all over. And when we moved here I was so sad that I wouldn't be able to eat it in the summer. But then I made day trip with my family to Phoenix and found this place! I was soooooo happy! I had no idea how I was gonna make it without my Rita's Water Ice. We love this place so much that we plan day trips around coming to this place. It's a family tradition that I don't have to break because he had one enough (2 hrs) to go to :)
1,"Beach party was erg cool!\n\n2 zwembaden waar iedereen stond te feesten en de strandballen rond gingen terwijl de dj de speakers liet knallen. Man-vrouw verhouding was goed. Verder waren en nog private pools voor groepen en ligbedden. Super uitzicht over Vegas!\n\nDe sfeer was erg goed. Vergeet niet je ID mee te nemen, anders kom je niet binnen."
1,Maybe the best Pizza I have ever had. Out of all the expensive dinners we had all week in Vegas this cheap hidden Pizza place has been the best best food by far. Amazing and fresh. Its like GOD Pizza from Heaven with a side of awesome.
1,Tuy is so sweet and always so friendly! She gives the best customer service and made my bambuu experience enjoyable! I come in just to order my drink! What a class act! My drink is delicious and the service is always pleasant!
1,The food at Olive Garden is always so amazing! Our Server Stan Lee Farley provided excellent customer service. He was very attentive and recommended a great appetizer. I will definitely be visiting Olive Garden again!
0,If you are hungry this place is not for you. My husband and I came in to watch an Angels game and we ordered three different things through out our time here. Nothing was really good and definitely not worth the money. They do have a nice set up as far as their TVs go. The service was good but I would eat before you come.
0,"I try to stick to the old \""If I have nothing nice to say then say nothing at all\"" rule. But I just can't hold my tongue any more about this place.  I have given it way too many chances and it keeps failing me over and over. I want to like it because it is so close to my house, but they make it so hard! The service is atrocious. \n\nI will not get into all the horror stories I have about this place, but I will share the most recent one. The straw that broke the camels back, NYE! Las Vegas has endless options for New Years celebrations and we had a hard time choosing. Finally we saw an ad for Silverton and it said $10 open bar at all casinos bars from 9pm-1am. Now at this point we have already sworn off Silverton and are sick of their 'Bait & Switch' marketing techniques, but how could they possibly screw this up? Going into it we knew they will be understaffed on bartenders and they will be grumpy, but we were somehow okay with that part. We talked all of our friends into this thinking how bad could it be?? BAD! They only had ONE WELL OPEN for the open bar. 5 bartenders standing around doing nothing and one moving at snails pace at the only 'approved area' for open bar. This is NOT an open bar. This is a soup kitchen line 30 people deep for a sample cup of domestic beer.\n\nOh Silverton you have fooled me for the last time. I put up with your home made sportsbook and the worst bartender services i've ever seen, but this is too much. I will never go here again. I'll wait till it goes out of business and PTs or Station Casinos reopens it as something good."
0,"Went there for lunch buffet, what a disappointment. For 5.99 you get pizza breadsticks and pasta. They will give you one small bowl of salad for an additional 99 cents ( what a deal ) I guess if you've lived in Phoenix your whole life then this is what you expect from their buffet. The pizza hut buffets we are used to for 5.99 include pizza, breadsticks, salad bar which includes salad, cold pastas, fruits,deserts and pretty much what you'd find on most salad bars plus 2 hot soups. All this for the EXACT same price! Wow.. Guess if we ever get a craving for pizza hut buffet we will wait until we go back to IL. to visit because it's a scam here."
0,"I'm not sure this Hollywood import will be around too long. First, the atmosphere. If you've seen the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, where the first 25 Degrees is, it's very similar in decor. It's very LA trendy and would be perfect for a lounge, but then you think about the fact that this is a burger joint, and suddenly the posh decor just feels like they're trying too hard. I'll take Delux's casually modern and hip for my burger place any day over dark LA lounge-y. Second, the service is just not good. They bring your onion rings/fries right after you order, but then your burgers don't come for 10 minutes, by which time your rings/fries are cold. They also neglected to bring any side plates for us to share the rings/fries. We asked for the sauce for the burger on the side, and when she brought it out and we asked for the sauce, she said, \""Oh, I think they put it on top.\"" The burger was also supposed to come with Thousand Island, which she forgot and we had to ask for. Then, we had to ask for water after my glass sat empty for 10 minutes with about 6 different servers walking by and not noticing. Now, about the food. It's just not good. The onion rings were greasy and the batter fell right off. The sweet potato fries were soft, mushy, and under-seasoned. The garlic aioli on my burger was basically mayo with a dash of garlic powder. The burgers are flavorful but not nearly as good as Delux, the gold standard for Valley burger joints, IMO. The worst part of all this is that they're overpriced and nickel-and-dime you for everything. Burgers start at $9 and then it's $1.50/cheese, $1/topping, $1/sauce. They even charge for dipping sauce for your fries (other than ketchup, obviously). Finally, there's this misstep by the owners: when you're designing a high-end burger place with a lounge-like atmosphere, a place for people to grab a bite before or after the clubs/bars, you probably shouldn't have the kitchen open up to the dining room so that people leave reeking of the smell of burger and fries grease. I don't know about others, but I prefer not to have the smell of burger grease all over my clothes and in my hair after dinner if I'm going out somewhere after. It's a classic case of a paradox between positioning and actuality.\n\nSave your money and head to Delux instead for a better atmosphere, better service, and MUCH better food."
0,"Stopped in for a quick dinner. Had the Sushi Combo 2 for $18, with a spicy tuna roll.\nFelt it was just alright, nothing terrible but I wouldn't want to order it again. service was great though."
0,"Okay... so I'm giving this place 2 stars... ONLY because we did not have an opportunity to try the food.  Saturday morning... we wanted to try out something new. We walk in from the entrance off of Cactus... and it was packed!  Oh good, that's a great sign for a new place. \n\nI make eye contact with a server across the way and it's like a eye dance of awkwardness...a glance here and a glance back and a nod here and a side tilt of the head...what the heck is happening???  So I walk across the way to find out how to get a seat.  He said, \""I just want to warn you, our kitchen is behind about 45 minutes.\""  Uh-great! Thank you for your honesty.  (Hence, 2 stars instead of 1).  I would be upset if I had to sit and wait for an hour for breakfast.  \n\nSo we took a gander at the menu and they had a beautiful array of breakfast muffins, rolls, pastries, etc. They all looked amazing!  But we ended up jetting on out... with a to go menu. I wish I would've taken pics of it!  It does look rather appealing with alot of great options.  I think $9.99 was the highest price I noticed!!  Most dishes/sandwiches around $7.99.  \n\nI'm definitely planning on going back because Ihop doesn't cut it for me and we need a great breakfast place in this area. \n\nI plan on updating this as soon as-as other poster's said, \""they get the kinks worked out.\"" \n\nLooking forward to it!"
1,"My repast at Comme Ca began with Escargot in Puff Pastry.  Surprisingly, I enjoyed the garlic-butter-sheened puff pastry as much as the snails, which were light rather than swimming in greasy garlic butter in shallow indentations on a platter as in most presentations of this dish.  I split the 10 snails with a dining companion.  Next time I won't!\n\nNext was savory Onion Soup Gratinee made with delicious Gruyere cheese.  The glompy strands of cheese resonated along with a sweet wine taste in the broth.  This rich and tasty soup was served in a white, lion-headed crock.  \n\nThis dish and the country salad following it were enhanced by small pointy baguettes of French bread smeared with butter.  The butter was served in very small dishes, but we ultimately received four of them without any resistance from assistant servers.  The country salad was marked by crunchy half-disks of hearts of palm.  \n\nMy entree that I eagerly awaited was Beef Stroganoff, which is not that easy to find at restaurants.  My only disappointment when the entree arrived was its portion size.  It was about half of what I desired.  But the light brown sauce, tender cooked cuts of beef, and egg noodles were all I hoped for.  My wife ordered poached lobster and light french fries that came with lobster sauce.  Her added request for Beurre Blanc was accommodated by our server without any problem, and at no additional cost.  I sampled the lobster, and it was equally delicious dipped in either sauce.  She was satisfied with the size of her portion, but a hungry male diner might have disagreed.  The only sour note for this dish was a Market Price of $72.00 on this evening.\n\nWe finished our repast with Pot de Creme, rich gooey chocolate topped with Chantilly Cream.  It was delicious.  Our dining companions' Creme Brulee looked promising as well, and was of the larger variety.\n\nAmbience was modern and somewhat antiseptic.  Our foursome was seated at a half-booth with two chairs in front.  Yet had we wished to brave the heat, we could have been seated just outside with a direct open view of the Eiffel Tower of Paris Las Vegas.  And, just arriving at the third floor of the gorgeous Cosmopolitan Hotel was an enjoyable experience.  We passed the impressive and beautiful three-story, million-plus-dollar crystal chandelier on the way up.  \n\nService was prompt, efficient, accurate, and friendly.  Offered artificial sweeteners for my iced tea were Splenda and Equal.  I would have preferred Sweet & Low.  Otherwise, I have no complaints, and the meal was worth the $177 tab for two without wine, including tax and tip.  But next time, if Beef Stronganoff portions remain the same, I will reluctantly request a double order, and forego the salad.\n\nAll things considered, it was a splendid dinner, and I will be back."
0,I've purchased baked goods from Cloud 9 a few times and have been disappointed each time. Their products range from dry and flavorless to overly sweet. Last time I practically broke my tooth on the stale cookie they gave me. I've had much better luck with the sweets from Novel Sweets and Bar Chocolate at the back of the market.
0,"Tacos were expensive and tasted bad.  Mom spent $12 for 4 large tacos which is absurd for a taqueria. I only ate it because we were hungry, it was late and at least it's not greasy spoon fast food.  The food was not the best quality as it did not hold up well by the time my mother brought me the meal, and she was not far away from the UMC where I was.  The tacos were cold, tasteless and the tortillas fell apart too easily when eating.  The vegetables in the taco did not taste like they were not at the peak of freshness even if they were still edible.  A good quality and fresh tortilla should be warm, soft and hold its shape as you eat it.  The red sauce was milquetoast."
0,"the toddy was good, the food not so much. it was pricey and there were a few too many flies buzzing around for my liking."
0,"You can but shouldn't really complain about the expensive drinks and cover charge. It's Vegas- what do you expect? However, with the outrageous cost of drink/admission you expect a high end, over-the-top, one-of-a kind atmosphere that usually removes some of the sting of a  $10 cost of water.  But...the construction of the venue was shoddy and the layout was awful. The pool was too small and it's strange design made it hard to have a view of the stage. The staff was nice, the crowd was great and they have obviously invested in some great DJs but the actual venue was a huge disappointment. Everyone I met there had the same opinion."
1,This is an awesome looking casino and hotel  from the outside with the black pyramid and makes for great pictures. Inside there are plenty of shops to check out and they have a pretty good sports shop you may find stuff in you haven't seen anywhere else. There are also plenty of shows to check out here as well. I saw Chris Angel and it was a great time. I did not stay or eat here so I cannot speak on those topics. If you get the big smoothie drinks from Bally's there is a location here to refill!
0,The portions are small and the food is pretty average overall.  This place seems to try too hard to be something they are not.  You could get better food at PF Changs and for a better price.
1,"I came for brunch on a recent Friday. I had the Brussel (sic) Sprout Hash; my companion had cornmeal pancakes and a side of sausage.\n\nThe hash was absolutely phenomenal. I normally experiment with different dishes, but if I return to Square Cafe, I will simply order it again. The sprouts were done as perfectly as I've ever had sprouts (tender, but with a little resistance left in them), the ham and onion provided a good counterpoint, and the ensemble was served over (quite good) grits and under a (nicely runny-yolked) egg.\n\nAll the flavors worked well together, and the portion was just right for a robust brunch.\n\nMy companion allowed me to sample her cornmeal pancakes, which I found to be a competent version of the offering; the berry preserves were excellent, and pairing the pancake with a bite of sausage is quite nice. The portion size was large -- we were unable finish them.\n\nShe also assured me that the coffee was top-notch; I did not partake.\n\nI intend to return; if the hash is consistently this good, I may have found a new favorite brunch place.\n\n----\n\nQuick update: returned this recent Friday, had the Brussels Sprout Hash again. Was not as good as the previous trip. Sprouts were hard (needed a little more time), and the yolk of the egg was barely runny (needed less time). Hoping this was an off day for the chef, and I didn't just get lucky the first time.\n\nUpdate 2: returned (again) and had the hash (again), and it was prepared more correctly this time -- slightly softer sprouts and runny yolk very much in evidence."
0,The worst food I have ever had from panda. Had to replace my orange chicken with the teriyaki chicken and then gagged on that.. Would never eat here again.
1,"When moving away from the South Hills and the delicious Dor-Stop, I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to find a unique and tasty new breakfast spot in the east. Well, thankfully, good friends quickly introduced us to Square Cafe.\n\nI highly recommend trying their specials. My first time dining here, I tried the pineapple pancakes topped with burnt almonds. They were delicious (though sadly a couple of the pancakes were raw in the center). The fruit crepes - which are always on the menu -  are also amazing. I was expecting the crepes to be heavy, especially since I ordered them with Nutella, but they were filled with fruit and seemed very light, dare I say, even healthy.\n\nI've also been very impressed with the restaurant's staff. They're helpful and friendly. We've been seated very promptly (even on busy Saturday mornings) and received our food quickly.\n\nThis is a great, must-try breakfast/brunch spot!"
1,great price.\n\nfor chicken & ribs
1,Love everything about this place! My family has been ordering carry out from here for at least 10 years. It's the best Chinese on this side of town. The lo mein rocks!
1,"DELICIOUS! We adore Thai food and try a new Thai restaurant any chance we get. After reading Yelp reviews we decided to try Thai Chili tonight. There was a good sized crowd, but not a wait at 7pm on a Friday, that was a plus. Our waiter, Ray, took great care of us without being over bearing. I got the vegetarian curry and my fiance' ordered the Shrimp Chu Chi, both were fabulous. I ordered mine at a hot level 3 and it was HOT, his was a 4 a FIRE HOT...luckily we like hot foods. But, I beware of the 1 to 10 hot scale, those low numbers are still very hot! \n\nNote that if you order brown rice instead of the white jasmine rice there is an additional $2 charge. They are upfront about the fee, but seriously? $2 for RICE? That didn't dampen my spirits but did make me wonder where else they might try to gouge me, but they didn't.\n\nEntrees are reasonably priced at about $10 to $15 each. We were fortunate to get a Yelp $15 for $10 deal. We also joined their 'club' so the next time we get 20% off. \n\nWe will return!"
1,"I don't know why more people don't like this place. I went here with my grandma for lunch yesterday & we loved it. Our waiter was so attentive & friendly. We had the mozerella balls as an appetizer, she had the angus burger which she loved & I had the chicken ceasar salad. I loved the dressing & the fries that come with the burger are yummy. They leave some of the skins on  & season them with sea salt, great combination. I also liked that on their lunchtime menu everything is $6.99 no matter what you order. There are so many selections! We topped off our great lunch with a pazookie, half white chocolate macadamia & the other half chocolote chip :) I hope this place stays around because it's a great little find in chandler."
0,"Been here before, sat at the bar, and it was good.  Tonight we brought family and it's terrible.  We waited for 30 min for food and it's not good at all.  Edamame came out last and it's over cooked.  Nigiri is flavorless and the cooked rolls took forever.  On top of that, service is terrible.  Our waiter is very nice but clearly spread too thin because we haven't seen him in about 15 minutes.  Probably not coming back unless we're desperate."
1,Mix Zone Cafe is sooooooo good! Their lunch specials are VERY reasonably priced and the food is wonderful. I can't wait to go there again! Go check it out.
1,"First off i have to say, i was never really into raw fish; my sushi included california. Thats all.\n\nAfter coming to this place I've try many different kinds of fish and other sea creatures! which all were very DEEEELLLISHHH! All you can eat is Very cheap! Wait time can sometimes be long but well worth the price of how great the food is! also sakebombs are not badly priced. I normally spend about $50-60 dollars here on sundays nights. We got in about 10 3/4th sized sake bombs!\n\nPretty good / strong buzz! The rice in our stomach kept us from being TOO drunk! We plan on going to this place every other Sunday or at least once a month!\n\nVery good place to go!"
0,"So, it was 7:22 a.m. on the first Saturday of 2008 when we walked into Matt's Big Breakfast.  The place was maybe half full when we were taken to a table for two with a seat on the side.  A friendly waiter came by for drink orders; I went with apple juice but was later informed they were out.  The whole order went a little something like this, 2 coffees, 1 milk, 1 waffle, 1 cakes, and 1 special of ham eggs green chili and cheese scramble.  I hear the coffee was drinkable.  The waffle and pancakes had somewhat of a buckwheat taste but not sure if that is what they actually were.  I am a huge fan of Belgium waffles and found myself terribly disappointed.  I see a Belgium waffle as having a slight crisp of an edge and a soft center.  This waffle was very soft with no crisp and almost like a moist sponge.  The special was not the best and the pancakes seemed pretty heavy.  The home fries seemed like they were cooked in bacon grease and maybe sat there too long.  I did like the small quaint feel of the restaurant.  All of the staff was very friendly and worked together.  People of all styles came for breakfast, there were regulars, people in a hurry for the airport, couples, families, singles, people of all kinds.  They all were all asked, \""How is the food?\""  They all seemed to enjoy.  At the places prime they could probably seat 24 people, give or take.  I will probably not be one of them, but I am glad I was one once."
1,"Only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because the service isn't the best, the food is GREAT! I ordered the Pad Thai and it was up there with others I've had!"
0,"There really should be some kind of board that gives accrediation to restaurants claiming to be \""Mexican.\"" That way the consumer would know that places like Taco Bell, Pedro's and ChiChi's (if they're even still open) are not really Mexican restaurants, even though they purport to be. That way folks wouldn't be fooled into eating at a \""Mexican Restaurante\"" just because there's an \""e\"" at the end of \""Restaurant.\"" \n\nAfter my meal at Pedro's, I decided to just hit up Taco Bell the next time I'm in Madison and I want \""Mexican.\"" It's just as crappy as this place, but far easier on the pocketbook. \n\nThis place is an afront to the people of Mexico and their cuisine."
0,"This Macy's don't have many stuff. It's a department store. So you'd think they have close to everything. Nope.\n\nI usually go just to see if they have what I saw on the Macy's website or the app but it's never there. So I end uo trying something similar with similar color and going ovwr to Southpark anyway to actually get the product. \n\nFor girls, on the other hand, is a different story. I know it doesn't have many stuff but my wife always finds something. They are just born like that. Kind of kike how men would probably get food better out in the wild I guess."
0,"Very average Indian food. Their daal is good and the naan is delicious. It's absolutely fresh, crispy and is full of flavor. Everything else on the menu was a miss for me. Lacked flavors! \n\nThe service is good and the place looks renovated and new.  The deserts are served cold but if u request them they will be happy to heat up the gulab jamun and halwa.\n\nIf you are really craving Indian food and want to give it a shot try their buffet. I will definitely not recommend this place for dinner. Save ur money. The buffet is $14 + tax +tip and all you can eat!"
0,"It seems like this place is trying to pass itself off as a nice restaurant, but don't be fooled, it's a sports bar. Their food was good by sports bar standards, but not great. \n\nI read a few reviews and it seems to be a recurring theme that the service was poor, and our visit was no exception. After waiting at the table for 10 minutes without anyone coming over, I went up to the bar and asked that a server be sent over, and it was another 5 or so minutes before she came. Oh, and I should also message that the restaurant was more or less empty when this happened. When a place is swamped, I let that slide a bit.\n\nTo summarize, good food, awful service."
0,"Every time I purchase a groupon from Danny's Car Wash there seems to be a technical glitch.  This time I came in with one of the receipts/vouchers generated by Danny's when I turned in my groupon certificate.  They said the car wash had already been used.  Really?  How could i have used it multiple times if you generate the ticket from your register?  To top it off, I always have to go back through and have them vaccuum the car a second time and touch up spots they miss when wiping down the interior of the car. I'm not talking about hidden spots!  I'm talking about lifting the floor mats and getting ALL of the dirt under them.  Or really cleaning the interior coffee mug holders that have obvious coffee cup stains.  I am on the hunt for a new car wash in North Scottsdale."
0,"I've been here a few times thanks to the relative convenience of just being a short walk away from work.  The food here is decent, the portobello burger is actually interesting, the mini burgers are not bad, and the regular burger doesn't have much flavor to it.  \n\nThe issue here is of course the service.  It just takes way too long to receive your drinks, receive your appetizer, receive your entree, to receive your check and even to get your card back.  It would be understandable if it was during a busy night where the tables were full and the servers were running everywhere, the only problem is every time I've been here it's usually nearly empty and somehow the employees still seem to disappear.\n\nThe one thing it does have going for it however is its location right at the edge of the Freemont Street Experience.  So if you want to sit on the outside area and just relax and people watch, it can be enjoyable.  Avoid eating here though if you're any sort of time constraint though.  Although I'll admit, I kind of want to have that portobello burger again."
1,"In all honesty, the more  I go here, the more I do actually find the prices a bit steep. I mean my chicken burrito is 6.95 not too bad, but my bill was 8.05 because of the sour cream I got. I never knew that you had to pay extra for the sour cream. Thanks for telling me...\nI will still give it a four because the food is fantastic, but I just wanted to make it clear to others that if you want sour scream or something enchilada style, then it is extra. Those things tend it add up at .95 cents and .50 cents an item. Just beware."
0,"Horrible horrible place! \n\nMy sister, niece, and grandparents went here for Valentines Day to try out the \""new restaurant in town.\"" I must say that it was nothing short of horrible.\n\nWhen we first walked in we stood there for about five minutes before anyone greeted us. They were pretty busy due to it being Valentine's Day...and whenever a new restaurant in Fountain Hills opens up, it's the buzz of the town for a few weeks. Anyway, we're finally seated in the back by the kitchen. We sit there for about 15 minutes before the waitress comes to take our drink order. We wound up putting our drinks in with our appetizer and food because we had so much time to decide. I ordered the pepper beef and asked if they could substitute tofu for the beef, as I'm a vegetarian. They said that this was no problem. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later our drinks arrive and they must have been sitting out for a really long time because the ice was all melted in them. Still no appetizer. By then, my sister, who is a waitress was growing irritable because she has two kids to feed and our appetizer still wasn't out. \n\nFinally, after about 25-30 minutes our food comes out and it's wrong. My grandfather, who is a diabetic, does not get his and my dish is wrong. Still no appetizer. \n\nMy sister gets up to get the waitress who walks over, shrugs her shoulders and walks away. No apology, no remedy, nothing. So, finally, after 15 minutes, my food finally comes out correctly. My grandfather still doesn't get his. \n\nWhen the waitress came back around we asked to speak to a manager. No manager ever came by and the waitress just started to ignore our table. Our drinks weren't refilled and our check took another 30 minutes to come. What was supposed to be a 45 minute dine-in experience turned into over 2 hours. Get this, despite all of our complaints we were still charged full price! And, this place is NOT cheap. \n\nWhen I brought the check up to the owner to complain she just looked at me and kept saying, \""Yeah.....yeah.....yeah.\"" In other words, I don't care, go away. \n\nWe will not be back and I hope this place goes out of business!"
0,"This place has really gone downhill fast. I have been going here for years, and really not paid attention to the competitors. They used to be called 1.00 cleaners. And at that price, I wasn't picky at all. Now? Not only have their prices soared, and force you to join their \""club\"" for implied coupons, etc...  Well, I haven't received one coupon yet, and lastly, even Tide cleaners is now less expensive on laundry, and they do a great job. So my review is, DON'T waste your money at legend cleaners. The free bottle of 11 cent water does not make the difference."
1,"We went for a bachelorette party on a Saturday night. Unfortunately, we were the only group there, but we got a lot of attention from the male dancers. The show was definitely entertaining and most of the dancers were having fun with it. The club looked really nice but we didn't stay longer as we had a checklist to complete. Would definitely consider coming back! The staff was super nice too!"
0,"There are few things that can go wrong when you give a drunk man a pizza and a side of breadsticks.  Whatever shortfalls a pizza may have are typically ignored in the drunken feeding frenzy or drowned out by copious lathering in ranch sauce.\nFalbo Brothers has performed an amazing feat by producing a pizza so vile and foul that not only could I not finish a single slice, but I was nearly brought to vomiting by the mere sight of my brother taking bites of this sewage-inspired cheese pie.\n\nTL;DR: Worst.  Pizza.  Ever.  Inedible."
1,"ENVY The Steakhouse has always been a restaurant we passed by, heard about, but never really thought about dining at.  Sure, we heard amazing things about this place, but it's another steakhouse in Vegas.  We finally took advantage of their restaurant.com coupon and had a cozy dinner for two.\n\nFirst up - I made reservations on OpenTable.com and requested we sit side by side.  Although I do note this in the reservation, it's rarely and sometimes noticed and acknowledged.  In this case, the booth had two settings specifically set up side by side.  Nice!\n\nAfter a slight delay, we got our beverages and menus.  It wasn't too hard to decide.  We barely made a dent in our warm bread and butter when our entrees arrived.\n\n* Bone-In Ribeye, 17 oz with Wild Mushroom Sauce ($45)\n* Bone-In Ribeye, 17 oz with Brandied-Pink  Peppercorn Sauce ($45)\n\nBoth orders came with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted seasonal vegetables.  One thing I appreciated from our waiter (Joshua) was that he told us that we probably had enough food without ordering sides.  And this is usually the part where they push the sides on you, but not in this case.  And he was so right!  The 17 oz is a big piece of beef, and there's really not a whole lot of room left for much else.\n\nThe steaks were perfectly cooked rare, and tender and tasty!  So tasty that we didn't even bother with our respective signature sauces that came with it.  Rather, we didn't even care for the sauces at all.  The meat was flavorful all on its own and that's what you call a good piece of beef!  Of course, half the fun is experimenting with their three salts and seeing which one goes best with your dish.\n\nThe garlic mashed potatoes were also good, and the roasted seasonal vegetables also had a good mix of veggies which surprised us.  Different kinds of squash, beets, and mushrooms were part of it.\n\nOverall, we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of service and food.  Service was top notch and the food had us interested in the rests of their menu.  Of course, coupons definitely help in this department.\n\n4.5 stars."
0,"My man took me here for my birthday last week, beautiful place, not sure if I would come back though.\n\nHe had the filet mignon and I had the paella.  We started with the Caesar salad- I judge a lot of restaurants based on how great their dressing is and this one was a little disappointing.  I love real caesar dressing, anchovy, garlicky, vinaigrette- not that creamy stuff that you get in a jar.  The salad looked like a piece of artwork but over all, too tart and too creamy.\n\nWhen our entrees came out- my man's looked delish! Mine, eh, not so appetizing.  His steak was perfectly cooked, the mac n cheese was spot on and the asparagus nicely done, not overcooked.\n\nMy paella, I'm afraid was not great, well at least not for what we paid for..the rice was undercooked and the seafood slightly overcooked. Oh well, happy birthday to me right?\n \nOverall, it was the thought that counts- would I be back? Nah- not unless its paid for by someone else..."
0,Well we are Latin but in the mexicant place we felt discriminate be a Mexican lady \nBad bad servicio all around ..
1,"This place is in my Top 5 favorite places to eat in Arizona, no question!  First of all, they're a brewing company so they have to have good beer, right?  Check!  In order to get people to stay and drink beer, they have to have a good menu . . . check!  To get said people to come back again and again you have to have good tasting food, right?  CHECK, CHECK, and DOUBLE CHECK!!\n\nAll of the food I've had is top notch and delicious!  And the beers??  I crave them!!  It was Kilt Lifter that first hooked me.  Then the Hop Knot (see my Nello's review for the best Hop Knot in town tip).  And the Pumpkin Porter, one of the best seasonals EVER!  \n\nWhile I think it is spectacular that you can get various Four Peaks Brew's at some of the coolest establishments across the state (even the Pumpkin Porter, when available), there is one brew that I can only find when I am lucky enough to go to Four Peaks . . . THE OATMEAL STOUT.  This is the most delicious, most creamy and smooth beer I have ever had in my life.  I dream of this beer.  The first time I tried this was shortly after I started drinking (and liking) stouts.   I tasted it, looked over at my BF and said \""I think this is better than Guinness.\""  Of course I got the evil eye, but I'm sticking to my guns.  The Oatmeal Stout at Four Peaks is my favorite beer of all time!\n\nFavorites from the menu include, Spicy Thai Hummus, Spanakopita, Bavarian Pretzels, Shrimp & Goat Cheese Bruschetta (it's a meal, but the garlic is no joke on this one), the salads are great, Bleu Light Special Burger, Veggie Beer Bread Wrap, Fish and Chips . . . just to name a few! =)\n\nThe patio is great.  The staff is friendly.  The parking is not the best, but eh, everything else makes it worth it.  Plus, I suggest taking a cab or the light rail anyway . . . better to not have to drive so that you can enjoy more brews!"
0,"If, after hosting a group of people and booking a block of rooms, you desire to be treated like crap, go to the Public House at the Luxor. They will ignore your reservation, give away table after table, and fail to put in your food order. When you bring the problems to the attention of the manager in a polite manner, you will be greeted with a shrug of the shoulders and a view of a back as the manager just ignores you and walks away. Overall, a rating of 1 star is too generous.\nI forgot to mention that the food was also 1 star at best. Cold and seasoned in a weird way. Tasted like soap to 6different people."
1,"This place is a really great place to go for some really great and affordable Thai food. I was here for the second time with a friend and the food was really tasty. \n\nThe thing that most impressed me was that when we went there was a very strong and disturbing sewer smell in the complex where the building was located. Even though we knew the restaurant can't really control this we decided to simply ignore it and continue to eat our awesome food. \n\nWe noticed a lot of people complaining and talking to the management about the smell and the Naga Team were courteous and very professional about the situation. \n\nWhen we asked for the check, a man who seems to be the owner came to our table apologizing for the smell (which was not his fault) and gave us a discount on our meal. \n\nI was super impressed and pleased with the service and the team at Naga. I would highly recommend this place to anybody who is looking to try a new Thai place. \n\np.s. Try the peanut sauce!"
0,Music was decent. DJ silver kept talking! So annoying. We just wanted to dance & enjoy the music!
1,Secreto is one of my favorite restaurants in Ahwatukee especially because it's hard to find non-chain restaurants around here.  The atmosphere is really cool and the food is amazing.  I'm not a big fan of beef or pork so that really limits my options but the Madres Pasta Favorito is amazing!  It has the best sauce I've ever had and the shrimp and guacamole salsa add the perfect touch.  Make sure you save room for dessert because the flan is to die for.  The only negative thing I would say is that we made a reservation and they forgot about us so we waited for a long time.  I don't really mind though because we were enjoying drinks at the bar.
0,"Definitely nothing compared to \""The Buffet\"" at the Wynn or Bellagio's buffet.  This is more of a convenience buffet if you're staying at the hotel and don't want to venture out for mass quantities of food.\n\nEverything seems kind of dreary compared to the top  buffets.  When it comes to food, taste is everything of course, however a good portion of that is going to depend on how well the food is presented to you.  The presentation of the food here is pretty sad.  Salads looked like they've been stagnant and out for a while, the prime rib and turkey looked dry at the carving stations, the desserts looked like something you'd get from Denny's. etc.\n\nthe only unique thing that the buffet offers was a mashed potato bar.  Pretty good and something I've never seen before.  They basically take an ice-cream scoopful of mashed potatoes and fry them up w/ all your fixings that you'd  normally have in a baked potato (bacon, chives, cheese, mushrooms, etc.).  Was definitely a different and yummy thing to munch on.  The coffee here is also pretty decent.  Then again, could've just been because I was sleep deprived."
0,"There is only sometimes when I travel and would like to expect a great time, but this time wasn't one of them due to the worst customer service from the ticketing to the flight attendants, to the baggage claim and back. Never would I suggest there services."
0,"I can only talk about the CASINO here, but from my impression of that I don't know that I'll ever experience the hotel by choice.  (Maybe due to the price or demands from friends who want to see the slanted windows in the main building, but never without significant prodding.)  The casino's fine, but there's an overall worn feeling.  It's also overly dark, feels much smaller than it is, and over the years has seen significantly increasing clutter with the massive additions to the atrium level.  I will say that the hotel gets some amazing exhibits and staff is very friendly.  But for now it'll mostly remain for me a brief stop to see what exhibits are there on my walk to or from Mandalay Bay."
1,Perfect summer night! Strawberry& Very Berry yogurt on a waffle cone for me.  Birthday Cake on a waffle cone for him.  Oh so good!
0,"I can only comment on what I experienced during our night time visit for \""the Gauntlet\"" haunted house. We had purchased a combo ticket for the haunted house and spooky golf. We have only recently moved here and didn't know our way around and the signs weren't clear of where to go. Having visited the restroom first, I found it to be disgusting with an overflowed toilet and water on the floor. Quickly leaving that area we had to ask around to find the haunted house. It was well done for the space used and I have no compliant about that. Once done with the haunted house we went to get our golf clubs and proceeded to what we thought was the golf course. We didn't know where to go so picked one of two- called the Princess. Really tough course and I wondered where all of the decorations were. Once done the crazy course we came across the one we expected to play on- the spooky one but had no signs leading to it. I complained about it and was told \""we don't tell people about the spooky one unless they ask and if we wanted to play we can pay extra\"".\nNo apologies and really- no signs?? \nHad to visit the restroom again before leaving and found it to be functioning but disgusting still. Note to parents- bring hand sanitizer and eat elsewhere as the food looked awful as well."
1,4.5 Stars \n\nLove the drinks...others love the DJ and House music...I wish I did my homework better because I really enjoy some of the jazz they play but like to converse with classic cocktails in hand.  IMHO the drinks here are too good for the scene which is not bad at all...just not what I want.
0,"Went for fathers day and quite frankly I think Beau is starting to lose his touch.  Nothing ever changes, Its always the same over the past two years. If anything lesser selections  of  meat and miniscule desserts.  Our waiter didnt listen to us, this is the second time with this guy,  I will never use him again. They stuck us in the back room and place was half full, I hate a 5* place with no table cloths, of course the other side does. The wine list is only fair.   Pork chop was dry, margarita was not made properly. When I asked him for just a little more tequila in the next he brings a double with still just a little tequila in it.  The evening was basically a lost experience.At these prices looks like more Binks, Christophers, Mission, Vincents, Petite Maison"
0,None of our rooms were ready when we arrived; the staff was INCREDIBLY rude. Our room smelled like chemical and the windows can't be opened. We came here for a wedding and not one person in the party was impressed. It's a shame that such a beautiful hotel is so horribly run. I would rather stay in a motel.
0,"Came here on a Tuesday after I arrived for work with a few coworkers.  No lines, which was nice, so we were seated right away.\n\nOn that night, they had their standard items, and many stations actually were closed which was disappointing.  They have your usual: carving station, salad bar, seafood, cold dishes, Asian, Italian, Mexican etc.  The carving station had prime rib, roasted turkey, and Polish sausage, which wasn't bad since all were done fairly well.  The gravy and the au jus needed a bit more work since they were somewhat bland.  \n\nAs for the seafood selection, crab legs were there and cracked in half for you so that's always a plus.  Few fish items prepared Indian and Italian.  It was good but I wish they had a legit sushi selection rather than just... California roll.\n\nMy favorite thing ended up being the pot stickers they had since they were done fairly well.  As for all their other hot foods, everything was... average.  Fried chicken's seasoning was whatever, and the taco station had ground beef that looked like it came from Taco Bell.  Salad bar was lacking as well.  \n\nThe funniest thing was that they had hummus but no pita bread or pita chips to eat it with.  I know some people like hummus by itself but if they truly spent the time in preparing the buffet, they would've at least thought of that!\n\nThe buffet with tax ended up being $28 exactly which is a bit pricey for the offerings.  Thank goodness I didn't have to pay weekend price for this place or else I would've bumped off another star!  \n\nOnly came here cause I stayed at MGM, so I probably wouldn't come here the next time around.  Definitely pay a little extra and go to the Wynn!"
0,"We found ourselves tooling through the forum shoppes one day on our recent trip to LV around lunchtime.  I had been craving Mexican, so we of course we stopped to check the mall Directory and voila!  We see La Salsa!  I was so excited!!  Little did I know............\n\nIt looked so cute when we went inside and then we noticed a great outdoor patio with a bar.  I think this must be the attraction, margaritas outside, that allows them to continue to stay in the forum shoppes and make money.  B/c our food was dire, bland, tasteless and all around the worst Mexican food I have ever had.\n\nAnd I do not say this lightly, I truly am the last person to be overly critical b/c every restaurant can have a bad day.  But this food was insipid and terrible-- PLEASE do not eat here.  There are so many other options, I wish we had taken one of them instead."
1,"What a great way to spend Easter morning!\n\nAfter taking part in the egg hunt on the main grounds (and BTW, they know how to do it here: Massive dumps of eggs full of goodies. More than the kids could carry. Plenty of photo ops. Parents who weren't acting out scenes from Soylent Green.) we made our way to this nicely upscale coffee shop/casual dining spot. \n\nWe were seated 30 minutes ahead of our reservation, keeping my little guy from popping a gasket. I chose the $19 breakfast buffet, and considering it included a custom-made omelette with organic ingredients--as well as juice and coffee--it was a steal. \n\nService was wonderful and the staff was sure to make us feel at home. Well, actually better than home because I don't have people looking after my every whim and need while at home."
0,"Not too happy with this location.  Went here for lunch this week and ordered the wicked combo meal and was asked to wait in front of the restaurant as it would take 3 minutes.  Well the 3 minutes turned into 15 minutes and so I didn't have time to eat it in my car and had to go right back to work,,,,Boo!"
0,I don't know how they managed to serve me a cold burrito but that just happened. Also 70 cents cheaper than in San Diego.
0,"Just arrived today and I had high hopes for the GN Rush Tower but the relationship between us turned sour as soon as we tried to check in. Room not ready? Sure we'll wait - and thanks for the offer to call us when it's ready. I love great customer service. Three hours later? No call. Boo. Ok, I let that pass. Checked in our room and it's cool - much more modern than the old tower for sure. Nice. Unfortunately safe was broken when we tried to use it, but it's ok, per front desk, housekeeping and security - maintenance will fix it. Thirty to forty five minutes later? Nada. Okaaaay. Patience. Finally just left the room and cancelled that request. Decided to sit outside at one of the hotel bars to relax and people watch, and I think you can write the rest of this review. Hello, Haydee - we'll complete your first day with us by introducing you to our prize Super rude waitress. And this is coming from an ex bartender and hospitality worker. I know customers can be arse-wholes - I get it! But come on Golden Nugget. Get your shit together. I'm here two more days! \n\nWill update review after I check out.\n\nAnd now...I'm breathing. :)"
1,"I have liked every person I have talked to there but their new veterinarian,  Dr. Josh, really goes out of his way to help.  I never feel rushed in person or on the phone when he is answering my hundred questions.   My only complaint is that some of the rooms are freezing cold.  I was there in summer clothes last time trying to cuddle my cat for warmth!"
0,"Yelp says this is a Mediterranean place, but it's actually Bulgarian cuisine.\n\n I had the mixed grill plate, which was alright. Service seemed like it would of been good if you are Bulgarian. I felt like an outsider invading their restaurant lol.\n\n\nMy friend that I ate with got food poisoning! Be careful!"
1,"This is such a neat spa! I had no idea they had such a big co-ed area. This is one of the very few spas in town that you will find a co-ed steam room, sauna, and hot tub. They have monthly specials that are very reasonable! December they had Gingerbread aromatherapy massage! Yum. They even have a little sample of the scented oil at the front desk you can smell before you book to make sure you like it. I also loved their idea of the different themed showers in the womens locker room. This spa is worth the small drive off the strip."
0,"I should have trusted the reviews on Yelp about this place. Here is what happened:\n\n1) He calls at 12 PM but does not entertain us until 12:30. I took an hour off from work but ended up being out for three hours\n2) There was no mention of grade of tint in the voucher but upon visit Dan(owner) tells you that in $80 you only get cheapest and lightest tint available. \n3) He continuously tries to sell you more expensive tint for 80 extra bucks and then yells if you decline.\n4) He keeps on telling you that why do you only want to spend $80. Can someone please tell him that he posted the deal, not us. He should honor that.\n5) I bought 5 window tint but he only did 2.5 windows. Side windows were only done partially and I was asked another $80 for remainder of it. This was never mentioned in voucher.\n6) All other tint dealer do complete car tint in 5 window and not partial. It was waste of both money and time since I will have to get it re-done anyways.\n\nI am going to ask for a full refund and action against this non-professional person."
0,"Eh, I don't really like this spot. Great location and all that, but the food wasn't anything to write home about. \nI've noticed other reviewers really liked the veg options, & maybe that's where I went wrong? I suppose I'll have to go back and try something else(or send in a clone). I had a burrito with asada & the meat tasted old--never a good thing, but if they're pushing vegetarian items, it makes sense....I guess..My friend had flautas, it's never good to mess with someone's flautas!! C'mon son! Maybe we went on a bad day?  Yo no se, but I'd go to Taco Bell before I go there to eat again. The chips and salsa should NOT be the best thing I eat."
0,"Lucille's is a great concept but does not deliver. While the service was great, the food was sub par and not as good as Famous Daves which is a lot less money! I do like the jalapeno grits and garlic mashed potatoes, but the brisket was dry and tasteless.My wife got the barbequed shrimp and it was over cooked and covered in a nasty sweet sauce. For the high prices that they charge I would expect much more! We will not be going back.Ever.\n\nIgnore these people that actually say that this place is great. They know nothing about good food. This place sucks."
0,"The buffet is super large and they make it very pretty, but as far as the quality I have had better and if it wasn't free with my hotel stay I would not have gone back."
1,"I was not prepared for the assault on my senses when I walked into this place!  This place was crazy busy and apparently everyone was hungry.  I felt people were seriously throwing elbows.  The smells were overwhelming too, in a good way and it was freaking loud.   3 different lines, one for each meat.  I heard the guy in front of me order two kinds of meat from the adobada guy but when I tried he said NO!  Must be my face.\n\nPer the suggestion of Yelpers, I went with the adobada tacos (aka spicy pork) and a carne asada muala.  The muala was pretty good but the entire time I was eating it, I kept wishing I had ordered it with adobada.  Not that the carne asada was bad, it's just that the pork was unbelievably good!  I agree with Misti Y. that the peppers and onions added absolutely nothing to the meal. Skip them and fill up on the delicious spinning wheel o' pork.  This place is not convenient to much of anything but was definitely worth the haul."
0,"We ordered a vegan pizza on the phone.  Got to the store, waited a few minutes and they handed it to us.  At the register, I had the feeling I should open the box and check it - low and behold they used real cheese on it.  I went back to the pizza area and told them we ordered a vegan pizza.  They kind of just quickly grabbed the box back and said we'd have to wait a bit for it... ok fine.  We waited.  Finally, they boxed up the new pizza and when I go to the checkout, not only did they charge us the full price for a pizza, but they tacked on the vegan cheese charge too.  Considering we waited almost 30 minutes, start to finish, and they didn't even apologize, I was not too pleased.\n\nThe store itself is on the cramped side and the parking lot is generally full and chaotic to get into and out of.  From a business standpoint, they should have at least apologized and offered some sort of discount on the pizza they messed up.  Not impressed."
0,"I really like the pizza in this place and have been there several times.  The BBQ chicken is my favorite.  This would have been a 4-star review except for the service.  Almost every time I have been in there (about 7 or 8 times), I walk in and get completely ignored.  No hello, no 'I'll be with you in just a moment, NOTHING.  They look up and look back down.  The one time I was acknowledged, the owner was sitting in a chair in the front and called to someone in the back WE HAVE A CUSTOMER with a nasty tone in her voice.  She sat there and didn't move a muscle.  I'm assuming she was either management or the owner.  Either way, shame on her.  I also resent being charged for credit card transactions....it's a few dollars but what the heck??  No other business I have ever been to in Las Vegas does this...and I live here.  There is no mention of this on the phone when you place an order.  I went without cash and had no choice.  After that, CASH ONLY.  A few more visits with such consistently lousy customer service (like they are doing me a favor) and I was DONE.  I have given up on this place and now go to other places."
1,Great food! There are very few places you can get great Mexican food and this is one of few! Great prices for the food and the staff are great people! I always go there after a night out!
0,"Food is always great at Outback.  We like to sit at the bar and eat and have a few beers.  We have been to this location three times and the same bartender has been on duty, Friday night.  She is rude and acts as though you should be grateful she is there.  VERY passive aggressive.  If you like to sit at the bar I would recommend heading up to Chandler location were you will receive customer service and not be forgotten (twice they forgot to put our order in) no apologies just rude sarcasm."
1,I loved Javino's! \nOn a scale of 5 stars I had to delegate 4 stars to the wonderful wine bar! The atmosphere was amazing and quaint! The beverages were fantastic and the in house band played some great chill out music. \nJavino's is one of those places that you won't be disappointed at all!\n\nStop by and enjoy a happy hour or an afternoon snack!
1,"We walked in the door.  The music was loud, the crowd a mix of beautiful people and people not wearing nearly enough clothes, and wandered down the spiral staircase.\n\nEnter GIGANTIC waterfall.  \n\nEnter strong cocktails.\n\nI spent a good portion of the evening waxing poetic about the waterfall, pity the people I met.  \n\nGood times."
1,Have been on two separate occasions. Sat at a table by the window the first time and at the countertop the second time. Great service and awesome food both times. Loved the tempura green beans and butter burger with tots.
1,Amazing food. Steak & Chilliques is the best! Very good coffee. Friendly relaxed atmosphere.
1,"Suuuuuuuuuch good delivery Chinese/Chinese-American. I can't get enough. I don't know of another place of this caliber with DOLLAR DELIVERY (okay, maybe my mind is warped from years in Chicago, I don't know) and six-dollar seafood dishes if you get the dinner special. My favorite is the Squid with Chili and Spicy Salt but everything I have had so far has been delectable. I miss Chicago's Chinatown, but Orient House totally makes up for that when I'm feeling glum."
0,"Meh... this place was alright. Nothing spectacular unless you're into sugar free deserts. Lots of those.\n\nThe 'fresh' crab legs were anything but. There sure were a lot of them though. Same with the ethnic dishes (Mexican, Chinese, etc). Same goes for their BBQ.\n\nIf you're looking for a good buffet to go to while on the strip, go elsewhere."
0,"Was one of my favorite places for breakfast.  However, my last two visits have been very disappointing.  The first time my breakfast took  a long time to receive and when it got there bacon was almost uncooked, hash browns were burnt, and eggs were dried up.  When I complained they said they had a new cook.  Next time I went (about 10 days later) a worse outcome.  Took 30 minutes to get (on a Friday at about 10:45) and the bacon arrived raw, eggs dry and cut up into tiny pieces, hash browns cold and toast burnt.  I told the server it was unacceptable and she offered to take it back.  I told her forget it and I left.  I don't know what happened but I won't be returning."
1,"I love Portuguese wines and this restaurant has an extensive choice.  The food was excellent, the service impeccable.  I felt it was a little pricey but what restaurant in Montreal isn't?"
1,Friendly and conveniently located. Love the Grilled Chicken Pita! Never a bad lunch.
1,"Came here for a late night snack and ohh what a wonderful snack! I ordered a grilled cheese GAAHHHD it was ALMOST too cheesy. It was an ooey gooey delight the bread was thick and soft and it all just melted in your mouth, i wish i had one now. The service was fast and friendly but i was there at 3am so it was fairly empty."
0,"The club itself is nice.  We ate at Andreas which was amazing, then bought VIP tickets to club.  Didn't need to do that so was given incorrect info by concierge at Wynn Towers, great.\n\nWent as a couple and there was no where to sit, unless we spent $600 on bottle service.  Uh that is great if your a large group.  We bought drinks $37 for 2 and then were told we couldn't stand next to the dance floor.  We were told we couldn't stand at the bar, uh where would you like us?\n\nMusic was good but if your not in a large group this is not your place.  \n\nThis was the first night of our honeymoon and it was upsetting.  We were so disappointed we just went back to our room.  There are way better, more friendly experiences and I only chose this as we were staying in the tower suites and it was convenient."
1,"I have been going to Jason's deli for a very long time. I originally ate there when I was in second grade in Memphis Tennessee. Yeah I know, a long time ago. I love how they are always fresh. The salad bar has crisp vegetables and is always very clean. Their food is flavorful, selling, and organic for the most part! Free frozen yogurt as well with your meal! Who can beat that! My favorite item on the menu is the spud o broc! It's a potato that is full of broccoli cheddar soup!  I had some additions. I add fresh carved roast beef provolone cheese and fresh broccoli to the mix. Holy moly it is amazing!"
1,"I, like Hailey H, typically don't lust after veg-only restaurants, but after a visit to Fern I can honestly say that I'm still craving a bunch of dishes there!\n\nThe vibe inside (and on the patio) of Fern is great - a nice, chill and green accompaniment to their menu. Service was on point during my lunch and my server was well educated and happy to lead me through the menu. She also mentioned that she's not a vegetarian and loves the food...and hey, that means a lot to us carnivores. The menu features vegetarian and vegan options with many of the vegetarian items available to be made into a vegan dishes. I can hear all the vegans rejoicing right about...now. \n\nMy lunch buddy and I snacked on a few different items...all of which were good to great. \n\nIced tea: 4/5: I gotta say their regular iced tea (at least during the day I dined here), was orange and ginger! It was super refreshing and delicious. \n\nIndian Tacos: 5/5: Three fry bread \""tacos\"" piled high with a hearty mix of beans and squash and topped with lettuce, tomato and sharp cheddar. This dish was bangin' and very filling. Anyone who says veggie or vegan eats can't fill you up, must try this. \n\nSquash blossom hush puppies: 4/5: Holy crap, I actually enjoyed vegan cheese?! Yes, lightly crispified squash blossoms filled with delicious vegan mozzarella with a side of onion \""butter\"". I didn't go crazy over the butter but frankly, I don't think they needed them. The order came with three blossoms. \n\nBuddha bowl: 3/5: Rice, a bit of faux cream, vegggies and beans presented beautifully in a bowl. The buddha bowl had potential but it was pretty bland for me. Everything was most certainly fresh, but I was itching for some spice somewhere in this big bowl of eats. \n\nOverall, Fern was really impressive and I think they have a great menu, inspiration and focus. Can't wait to go back and try more!"
1,"Hm, den Titel finde ich nicht so ganz korrekt, aber das kann ich leider nicht \u00e4ndern...\n\n\n Denn das Kashka ist das \""Karlsruher Second-Hand-Kaufhaus\"" und f\u00fcr mich nur \""nebenbei\"" ein soziales Projekt der Diakonie.\n\n\n Denn ich gehe ins Kashka zum \""kruschteln\"": in gebrauchten M\u00f6beln, Geschirr, Schmuck Kleidern, Lampen etc. Ist wie ein kleiner Flohmarkt, nur eben \""immer\"". \nEinen super tollen Eisk\u00fcbel habe ich da gefunden, Kleider f\u00fcr eine Mottoparty, einen total tollen riesengro\u00dfen Korb, ein lange gesuchtes Vergriffenes Buch, einen super coolen Couchtisch und und und...\nAlleine deshalb ist das KASHKA echt cool.\n\n\n Was hier sozial ist, sind die Preise- mehr als sozial.

1,"While the food at Sol Y Sombra wasn't complicated, it was certainly yummy and the service was (surprisingly given the cool vibe and the beautiful people -- I mean the staff not just the customers) totally relaxed and friendly.\n\nThere we were schlepping in with our shorts and t-shirt...and without a reservation at that.   No attitude from the hostess.  Though the place was fully booked, we were happy with our bar seats...easy access to their yummy mojito and sangria..and the tapas started flowing. \n\nOn my  to be repeated list were the baby back ribs (for the sweet/tart quince and sprinkle of pimenton), the asparagus with crab (loved loved the romesco sauce) and the trout with sprinkle of hazelnut and salsa verde\n\nEverything else (calamari, pan fried potatoes, brussel sprouts, mussels in tomato broth) were all solid.  \n\n3 stars for food alone and extra star for friendly service"
0,This place is absolutely gross the bathroom is horrible the rooms are dirty the wait time is insane over 4 hours when someone is in extreme pain is insane! Avoid this place if I could give it -100 stars I would
1,"I love the library! The location is great for me and the kids. In ten years I've never had an issue with the staff. There is a good selection of books, DVDs, and magazines. Anything I can't find on site I can usually locate within the system and place a request."
0,"I choose this nail salon based off the yelp reviews. I am extremely disappointed with my nails. I had a mani on 10/18 and six days later the polish is chipping. So I stopped by the salon to speak with them and get my nails done again. They informed me that if I got the gel nail polish it would last longer. I have my nails done, with regular polish, twice a month and never have experience this. When you pay for nail service and tip the person well, you expect this service to last at least two weeks. Unfortunately, I will not return and I will not recommend them to other patrons."
0,"Do not go there during the day. The place is dead, the girls are so so. Just not a good place to be during the day. As for nights here, you can't even get seated on a Friday or Saturday. There is a line out the door. There are hundreds of girls but the place itself is small. No walking room. The girls are pushy. Not my first choice by no means."
0,"Service sucks here. Our waiter seemed aggressively rude. Food was okay, pretty much the typical average Vietnamese restaurant. I'd honestly just stick to Kim Long if I need my Vietnamese fix when in Vegas."
1,Nice American Continental. Nice Atmosphere
1,"It's only worth coming here for the rolls.  Everything else that I've tried is a ridiculous ripoff.\n\nWith that said, their \""fusion\"" sushi actually works pretty well!  Apple smoked bacon and unagi roll?  Tasty indeed.  Their other novelty rolls are extremely tasty as well.  However, their traditional sushi isn't that great.\n\nEvery other time we're in town we find ourselves getting the salmon triangles, which are truly unique in an onigiri sort of way.  It reminds me of that \""fan tuan\"" at Taiwan 7-Elevens, cept with salmon!  \n\nThis place is on the expensive side, but this is my favorite \""rolls\"" place in Champaign.  Note that I say rolls, and not sushi in general."
1,"I stopped in here to get some cheap produce when I was visiting Vegas, and I loved it. I wish there were one of these closer to my home -- I would save so much money on fruits/veggies! The produce section was filled with cheap, ripe items (I still can't believe pears were 25 cents a pound); however, I did have to pick through to make sure I wasn't getting overripe things. It was a lot of fun to go through this store and see the mix of Mexican and American items, and everyone in the store seemed to be fluent in both Spanish and English.\n\nThe employees were all very nice and friendly, and they spoke to us in English.\n\nI highly recommend coming here to get low prices on produce, although other grocery items did not seem as inexpensive."
0,"To say this place needs a rehab is an understatement. Diamond is in the process of doing this but it is a long drawn out process. Our room has water damage, the sink is clogged, and the dish washer is non op. Overpaid for the room based on the point we used. Expedia has it for around $60/ night. On the positive side, the staff is very nice and the pool, hot tubs, and slide areas are fantastic for the entire family."
0,"There are two things I cannot stand: bad service and parking tickets. Luckily I only had one tonight.\n\nI had read several reviews saying the service was slow here, so I came prepared to wait. I did not, however, come prepared for a waitress that made eye contact but steered clear of our table for ten minutes while we tried to point out she brought the wrong appetizer. When she finally made it over, she said it was what we ordered even though we clearly said something else (do tempe and tahu sound similar to you?).\n\nMy dining partner, being polite, did not demand we get our original appetizer, much to my chagrin.\n\nAfter that debacle, it took a good twenty minutes to get our food. The food was good, but I had wanted a papaya dish several yelpers said they loved, and they were out of papaya.\n\nAll in all, the food was relatively good though didn't strike me as particularly authentic (I've had the same dishes at Laotian and Thai places), but the service killed it.\n\nI can understand being busy and not having time to come over, but we were one of four tables. I can understand making a mistake on an order, but then you offer to bring the correct dish. \n\nAll said, won't be going back."
1,"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Chandler! They offer an awesome line up of beers along with delicious food. However, after last night, I recommend avoiding Sunday nights at San Tan, because the rookie entertainer on guitar could quite possibly ruin your dinner! \n\nMy family and I went in to eat on Sunday 7/27. Everything was terrific! We had the nachos, mac and cheese, and a couple burgers. The boys all ordered the Mr. Pineapple beer, their favorite, and the ladies had cocktails and wine. Our server Mike was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. We sat on the patio which was actually very nice considering it's Arizona in July! \n\nWhat we didn't love was the \""entertainment\"" they had playing up front that unfortunately carried through the speakers outside. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for independent musicians, but this guy was awful. He had a guitar loop playing with him that he had trouble keeping up with, and botched the words to several songs that most people hold sacred. (Hootie & The Blowfish, The Beatles, Matchbox 20....) \n\nWe ended up leaving early and heading to La Stalla (Italian restaurant right down the row) to have after dinner drinks and dessert. They had a bald guy there playing electric guitar (and not annoyingly ruining some of my favorite songs) which was lovely!\n\nSan Tan is a wonderful place to eat, I highly recommend it.

0,"Beware.  \n\nOnly 4 reviews at the time should have been my tipoff but I went with Blooming Valley Landscape anyway.  Jeff seemed like a nice guy on the phone, but this company is extremely unreliable.  \n\nJeff showed up once on schedule but missed the next scheduled appointment after we waited all day to hear from him.   Communication is extremely poor.  Calls to Jeff are met with a chronically full voicemail box.  E-mails and texts go unanswered.\n\nAfter delaying our project by more than 2 weeks waiting for Jeff to return our calls, we finally pulled the plug and moved on to another landscaper.  If they are this slow with communication we can only imagine how much slower (and more costly) they will be with the actual work.\n\nStick to the professionals.  I don't recommend these guys."
0,"I will never go back to this VW Service Department. \n\nSimple reason: I paid over $250 for a 50K service check up. I specifically mentioned my steering wheel fluid should be checked.  When I picked up my car, I was told that the car looked fine & that all the fluids were topped off.  I was also told they couldn't help my remove my license plate which had rusted nails screwed into it. Was told to take it to a body shop. The body shop I went to happened to have a mechanic who specializes in European cars. He called a VW Service Dept and asked them to send him the parts he would need to FIX THE PLATE. HE DID THIS in 2 Hours. Freaking lazy VW people. Mechanic also told me he topped of my steering wheel fluid which was dangerously low. When I called the VW service dept to ask them specifically what work they did to my car in charging $250 and why the steering fluid was not actually filled, I was told I would receive a call back after they investigated what happened. \n\nNO PHONE CALL BACK EVER. \n\nWTF? I basically burned $250 by going to this VW Service Dept. Will never make that mistake again."

1,"LETS START OFF WITH ALL YOU CAN EAT FOR TWO HOURS!!!\n\nYes two hours for one of the cheapest all you can eat sushi I've seen in Las Vegas myself. Some will say that service of the sushi is a tad slow but hey you get two hours. Who likes to be rushed when eating anyways? I enjoy food so I would like to enjoy it at a nice pace thank you.\nIf your with great company that gives some extra time for some intellectual exchange of words (conversation). Plus the two hours give enough time to let the rice settle a bit and enough time to try a good portion of the menu.\n\nThe service might be a tad slow but the workers are always pleasant. I actually feel like I'm wanted there.. not like that other Asian restaurants..\nThey also are very knowledgeable with the menu which leads to great sushi suggestions.\n\nThe sushi at Oyshi I say is the best I've had in Las Vegas! \nI would like to suggest the RED ROCK ROLL due to the fact that it contains \""Orgasm Sauce.\""  The sauce is rightfully named this because it will climax your taste buds into ecstasy!\n\nConclusion.. YES!"
1,"On my recent flight to South Bend, IN, I flew through this Mesa Airport.  I stopped by this place because I wanted a sit-down meal and perhaps a glass of wine.\n\nThe gals attending there were friendly and attentive and quick, they did not have that same airport worker drone attitude that big airport service employees have.. .which was a pleasant treat.\n\nI was even more impressed with the delicious and lush Rex-Goliath PN they served me in a beautiful, clean, sleek wine glass.  The spinach salad was huge, colorful and plentiful with chicken, goat cheese, pecans, and a tasty vinaigrette dressing.  Very impressed for an \""airport\"" establishment when this type of quality is usually not the case: Friendly staff, bright and fresh salad with plenty of ingredients, great wine!\n\nToo bad there isn't one of these in Terminal 4 or Terminal 2 :("
0,"I was in Madison for a night and picked this hotel as all the downtown hotels around Capitol Square were booked solid. Madison is small enough that getting downtown is still a pretty quick drive - take Mineral Point to Midvale to University Avenue. \n\nThe room was surprisingly spacious and the appointments were of decent quality for the price (around $60/night), the wifi is free (a lot of expensive hotels charge $15/night for wifi - seriously!?), and the staff is very pleasant and accommodating. However, the following items were disappointing.\n\n- The bed sheets weren't exactly clean. There was plenty of hair from the previous occupant in the bed. Not fun to discover that.\n\n- There was a bar of soap lying in the bathtub with more hair. Gross.\n\n- The pillows were substandard. They were extremely small pillows like one would find on a couch. Not fun for sleeping on and I had a pretty restless night thanks to them.\n\nI'd probably stay here again if the downtown hotels are all booked up but if I have a choice, I'll pay a few more $ and stay downtown."

I got the special which was spinach and ricotta ravioli in a brown sage butter, it was to die for! My husband ordered clam linguini which was also delicious!  The service was great and so was th atmosphere. If you want Italian eat here."

My friend and I both took pictures of our food ... that's how good it looked ... and it tasted even better.  Try the Breakfast Sandwich. YUM!\n\nTheir servers are incredibly nice.  Plus they have an amazing mimosa deal for brunch.  $12 for bottomless.  So good.  As a side note, we were impressed how clean the place was.  We imagine they had to clean up a fair amount from the crazy night before.\n\nI feel like it's only a matter of time before this place starts getting packed on the weekends.  For now, it's a nice change of pace from RnR's weekend brunch party."

0,"Incidents of poor service are almost always simply an individual disgruntled employee, but I still believe they deserve to be called out.\n\nDuring a long flight delay, a few buddies & I went for some (rather tasty) Margaritas at the Tequileria. As we were ordering, our server, who for the purposes of this review will be known simply as \""Mr. Chips\"", informed us that the margaritas we were ordering had \""1800 premium tequila and Grand Mariner, because that's all we have\"". Slightly confused, we ordered said $13 margaritas and then asked if we could have a side of chips & salsa. Mr. Chips' response: \""No, sorry, all we have on the menu are nachos, do you want nachos?\"" When we told him that nachos were too much food and that we just wanted a little thing of chips he said \""sorry, can't do that, so you want the nachos?\"" and we were forced to call after him (he immediately started walking away) and tell him specifically NOT to get us nachos. When pressed later about the chips (after we saw another customer get a little thing of chips & salsa with his meal), Mr. Chips said \""nope, this is a union job, can't break the rules\"" and still refused to sell us some lousy chips & salsa.\n\nWe sat there incredulously drinking our margaritas until the ladies sitting next to us tried to do the exact same thing. We overheard them discussing how the nachos were too much and how they just wanted a small order of chips to go with their beer, and couldn't help but start laughing. They looked over at us shocked, and we explained how the same thing had happened to us! Turns out the chip stunt wasn't so funny to them, because it seems Mr. Chips had been berating them earlier for no apparent reason, calling their eye color ugly (brown like #&@#) and generally being antagonistic.\n\nUnfortunately our flight left too soon for us to see the manager (\""they couldn't find her\"") so we were unable to witness the denouement of the chips saga, but please please try and find somewhere in Terminal C to patronize that isn't the Tequileria!"
0,"The food was pretty decent, but the service was painfully bad.  We were playing video poker, so we ate at the bar.  The bartender ignored us and it was impossible to get her attention.   When she did stop by she took my calamari appetizer before I was done.  We both had steaks, which were ok.  The gnocchi side dish was good.  \n\nThere was a shift change while we were there and the second bartender was slightly better, but still difficult to get his attention.   All of the customers at the bar were seated at one end of the bar and both bartenders would hang out at the opposite end of the bar without checking on us, which was very shocking.  Two other customers were complaining about the service.  We didn't complain, but felt like unappreciated customers.\n\nPortion sizes were generous, but food prices were high.  Probably won't return because there are much better places to game and eat with better service and prices.  I had a Groupon here that I forgot to bring.  The service was so bad I gave it to a friend (who I warned first) to avoid the frustration."
0,"I used to work in the plaza with Enzo's, so it was a convenient thing to eat on my lunch/dinner breaks.  The service is very hit or miss.  Sometimes the staff seems to bend over backwards to make you happy, and at other times they make you feel like you are an inconvenience.  Whatever.\n\nThe pizza is pretty generic.  As others have said, the sausage is good.  The sauce is pretty boring.  However, the crust is nice - light and fluffy.  Topping distribution is really odd.  I ordered a pizza there tonight, and there were FIVE pepperoni slices baked on top of each other, while other slices had none.  Weird.  \n\nOh, and don't order a dinner salad.  It's literally just lettuce on a plate.\n\nOverall, my fiance and I eat at Enzo's when we're sick of everything else.  It's not exactly something I crave, but it's okay.\n\nEDIT 07/10/12:  I took away an additional star.  While my review regarding the food quality stands as written, the service has gone downhill... if that's even possible.  Enzo can be so damn crabby sometimes that I feel like cowering in a corner if I need to ask for something.  Why would I waste money at a place like Enzo's when there are so many alternatives?  If you want to try some great local pizza with likewise great service, try the new Bistro Pizza on Gibson.  It's fantastic."
0,"There is a reason this buffet is such a bargain. I had both breakfast and dinner at this buffet. It's just not that great, nor memorable. \n\nThey have a create your own pasta bar which is decent, Italian, Asian, Mexican, and American food for dinner. The service is slow for drinks as well."

I found out from Ossalaer themselves that all mail was returned, yet they continued to send to that address.  Finally I got a letter from an attorney's office stating that there was a lien on my house due to unpaid sewer and HOA dues.  What morons, for 15 months they continued to send mail there. Everyone else including Navajo county tax recorder had my mailing address, and the HOA themselves.  Yet, Ossalaer didn't bother to find a correct mailing address. When I called them they were absolutely no help either.  I finally got it straightened out through my HOA board."
0,"Slow service with a large group. And very poor management. Our group had an issue with the check, and the manager \""was too busy to come out and talk to us.\"" That's not customer service."
0,"The resort is dated and in need of updating. The room size was OK, but we were disappointed by the quality and cleanliness. The toilet ran continuously, unless the handle was jiggled afterward. Only 2 towels were provided for a party of four. The beds were not comfortable. There were stamped-out cigarette butts left on the balcony! The pool is small, but I give it high points for being heated and open 24 hours. Our children could not enjoy some of the recreational activities. For example, they wanted to play billiards, but the billiard tables were solely within the bar area. It would have been nice to have some outside the bar. The price for the room was great, but this experience proved the old adage that you get what you pay for."
0,"I went in to Excellent Nails for a fill. The lady asked the normal question of what colors I wanted and I said \""pink and white and one finger with alternate color acrylic (instead of white)\"". I asked if they can do this and she said \""yes\"" but looked annoyed. She then walked over and grabbed the acrylic colors and brought them to the desk. She asked me what color I wanted and I said, \""I'm not picky just a fall color like orange, red, or brown, whichever you have\"". She started looking through the box of colors and I noticed she was getting even more annoyed (tossing the acrylic containers in the box). She then tossed down the colors and said to me that she does not know how to do fills and I need to come back later. I truly do not understand why she was rude to me. Maybe she was having a bad day but after this experience I will never go back to this place again."
1,"Can be a bit pricey for chain italian food, and the walk-in wait times on a weekend will stun you. Can be very busy and noisy.\n\nHowever, the food is a step up from Olive Garden and they do have gluten-free pasta and will work with food allergies. \n\nThe main question is that for these prices would you rather go somewhere that is not a busy chain restaurant......"
0,Save your $ and eat elsewhere. Their bar is good though.
0,"We went here on a Saturday night and although it was busy, we were seated right away. I did ask the hostess for a high chair which she never brought. The server then came and took our drink orders and we had some questions about the menu. He was rude and not helpful at all. He didn't smile or even pretend to be good at his job. After he took our order, a soda was spilled at the table, it was all over the table, the floor and my husband. No one came to help us clean it up. We had to clean it with the few napkins that were on the table. The server finally came and took the dirty napkins off the table and wiped the table down however the floor NEVER got cleaned up. We had to sit with our legs up because the floor was covered in coke. \n\nOn to the meal. We ordered Caesar salad which was generic and a BBQ chicken pizza  and pepperoni pizza. My daughters loved their pepperoni however my husband and I didn't enjoy the BBQ chicken pizza. It was cold and chewy. My youngest daughter had the kids macaroni and cheese which she loved but the plate was served piping hot. Why would you serve a kids meal (with a baby at the table) on a piping hot plate?!\n\nThe kicker was the bill. There were 5 of us and the check was $65. I guess I wouldn't have minded if the meal and the service was good but I was completely unsatisfied with everything about this meal. \n\nI will not eat here again and would not recommend this place to friends."

(health dept thing not the restaurants' choice I'm sure.)\nVery loud in dining room\nChips were passable but way too salty.  Possibly try less salt and a finer grain like popcorn salt since a little goes a long way.\nExpensive for the portion size.\nCarne tasted washed out like it was sitting in a pan and lost its caramelization.  Maybe I should order fresh off the grill next time?\nOver all I have high hopes for Frijoles and think they could do very well with a few changes.  Good luck guys!"
0,Business owner has indicated the customer service issues will be addressed with the affected employees. I appreciate the restaurateur's followup.
1,"I had a great experience with Hotel Missoni. It was unlike anywhere I had stayed before - extremely modern in every way. Some people referred to it as having an Austin Powers feel. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you have to pay for wifi. Our bed and breakfasts across the country had free wifi  and for paying that much more, we felt it should have been complimentary. Additionally, if you book early enough you can get a great deal!"
1,"Some friends and I went to Narcisse last Saturday night.  The cocktail I was holding was a little cold and my arm was getting tired from holding the drink at a certain angle to maximize the coolness factor so I decided to set the drink down on this little ledge above a white leather couch. At that particular moment I made a mental calculation that my drink had at least 51% of it's weight on the intended surface. It did not take long before my hypothesis proved incorrect because it turned out that a larger portion of my drinks weight was resting on nothing other than fresh Arizona air. The glass tipped over and began to spill my rum and diet all over the beautiful white couch. I used my Jedi reflexes (that ironically failed me a moment ago) to catch the glass before it could fall towards the floor and possibly shatter. None the less, most of my drink ended up spilling all f'ing over the place.\n\nWithin seconds a security guard was at my side with a tiny flashlight directing other members of the staff to begin cleaning everything up. I apologized for being so clumsy and assured him I would try much harder in the future to stop causing trouble.  He explained how it was no problem and it happens all the time. I thought this was great customer service. I will definitely be back to spend more money and finish each drink."

There are three buildings to the museum and they are all connected through tunnels, which I was happy about because it was -10 degrees outside.Its a great place to visit if you want to find something to do for a few hours."
0,I love this chain.   Not this store.    2 people staffed on a Saturday during lunch isn't enough. \nThe staff was more interested in arguing about how to charge me for my sandwich than making it.\n\nKept pushing me to have my sandwich Mike's Way.   My name is not Mike and I want it my way.  \n\nHere is a hint.   Use only enough oil to make the sandwich moist.   I am not trying to lube a car.  \n\nTrain the staff better and teach them some manners please.
1,"WOW ! What a delicious surprise... Had a late breakfast (1pm) with a friend, had an opening cup of chowder, KILLER GOOD, lots of clam, shrimp and even had some crab (rivals Mo's Famous chowderhouse on the Oregon coast !).... then had the California omelet, fluffy, LOTS of avocado, sausage and cheese, MMM-MMMM ! ... Delicious and bigger than HUGE ! (6 eggs !!!). Had to take half of it home. Great waitstaff, great atmosphere and decor, will definitely return."

0,"I will not be returning to this location!  The manager working on Friday night 4/18/14 was very rude!!  I purchased 2 GUM Go-Betweens for my daughter and went back  to return them 10 minutes later because they were not the right size that my daughter uses.  I originally purchased them with a GUM manufacturer coupon and upon getting my refund the cashier said \"" since your  getting  money refunded to your credit card,  it is against store policy to return your $1.00 manufacture coupon back to you\"".  I said \"" that is not right because I need to repurchase the correct size Go-Betweens at another CVS perhaps\"".  I had just given the coupon and knew it was in her register.  I then asked for a manager.  As he approached the counter he said \""no, you can not have your coupon back it is the policy of CVS\"".  He then proceeded to say \""If you go to Walmart and use a coupon they would not go to their office and get it for you when you return something.  I said that is wrong.  Most cashiers return your manufacture coupon if it is right in their register.  He then just walked away from me and did not resolve the problem.  Later, I called the CVS I usually go to.  I explained what happened and how it was handled and was told by a woman, CVS does not keep the manufacture coupon and he should have instructed the cashier to return it to me or give me a $1.00 gift card in place of it.  I think the CVS at this location is handing in manufacture coupons just so they do not appear under at the end of the night.  The district manager should really be aware of managers like this because I was hesitant to ever use a coupon in a CVS again until I decide to call another location and get the truth of how their policy really works!!  BE CAREFUL ABOUT THIS WHEN YOU ARE SHOPPING IN THIS STORE!!!"
0,"I have been going here since the 90s and it has been up and down.  Some ok food, some terrible.  Once found fatty masses in my meatloaf.  Recently it has been just ok.

0,"I really used to enjoy coming here for an after work drink, as I like to play a little video poker, cowboy bowl, and the jukebox is quite alright. After last night, I will not be returning. For some reason or another, the graveyard bartender was ignoring us and giving us the cold shoulder. We've been there at least half a dozen times, so he possibly would slightly know our faces and that we tip well. He never came and offered us another drink, but offered the couple next to us another round. My gf and I are both bartenders, so we know how to tip. Perhaps neighboring Sedona will be our new bar of choice."
0,"Good idea in theory, however it's a shame that its so poorly ran. Director is a liar and a cheat.  I would never send my children to this hole in the wall.

1,"Being a Nobu fan, I was anxious to try the Nobu Hotel.\nRooms are a little more expensive then most Hotel's in Las Vegas.\nWe had a  strip view room on floor 81 (it starts on floor 73), was one floor from the top. The view was average, you had to looked to the left to see the strip, if you look straight out of your room you look at another tower.\nIt was a nice touch that I received a email a couple of day before arrival date offering transportation (for a charge) and free VIP tickets to pure and at a special area of the pool.\nThe limo was waiting for us baggage claim and once we arrived at Caesar's  they had a bellhop waiting for us to take us to Nobu's private check in desk.\nOur room was not ready so we went to the Forum Shops to eat lunch and my only complaint was because the room was not ready and we were in the Forum Shops I ended up buying my wife  a Louis Vuitton purse. Dam I sure wish that room was ready.\nOnce we got to the room, it was well appointed. We loved the open shower and the bathroom. The room had a nice couch, big TV  and a great comfortable bed. It was average size, I miss the size of a suite (what I usually stay in L.V.)\nIt was hands down THE BEST ROOM SERVICE, I EVER HAD. What do you expect it's made from Nobu's  kitchen, it was like no room service I have ever had. Some dishes are made for room service only and is not served in the restaurant.\nI would stay there again just for the room service.\nIt now ranks up there with my favorite hotels in Las Vegas."

0,"The hotel smelled very nice- less smokey that most.  The gaming tables were a lot of fun.  The rooms were nothing special, but not bad, either.  Biggest problem was valet services.  Took nearly 20 minutes to get a taxi every time.  The front was littered with trash- every time there was a wind gust, we were pelted with dirt!  Check-in was also a lengthy process."
1,"We took the long walk from the Excalibur to the Rio and worked up a massive appetite so we could enjoy this amazing buffet for lunch.\n\nThe Carnival World Buffet is HUGE! There were an abundance of stations and we weren't able to try it all because there was just too much!  Their Asian choices were very good, as were their Italian style salads.  There was an absolutely amazing cheesy pasta that I wish I would have had more of.  There was a sandwich station but we decided that if we opted for that, we'd be too full to enjoy dessert!\n\nThe desserts were phenomenal.  We tried 4 types of gelato between the two of us and none of them disappointed.  The bread pudding was delicious, as was the cheesecake.  The cherry pie was ok, but nothing to write home about.  \n\nThis was our favorite buffet in Vegas and it was definitely worth that long walk!"

0,"I got food here twice.  I rarely eat fast food but have a soft spot for egg mcmuffins; they don't seem THAT bad for you and are filling.  The first time, the English muffin part of it was just about burnt to a crisp and inedible (leaving me hungry until lunch).  The second time, it was barely toasted and the cheese was cold (giving it a much much much less desirable flavor).  This mixed with kinda rude staff (for those I've dealt with) on both occasions and I'm not going to make the same mistake a third time."
0,"I've been here twice. First time we sat in a booth in the back away from the bar and there were fruit flies all over the place. One fruit fly even decided to take a bath in my friends drink. Service was very slow. My wife ordered a wedge salad with no onions and the server brought it with onions.  She order one of the featured cocktaisl and had to send it back  because of the overwhelming amount of sour mix used by the bartender.  Our friends drink was mixed very poorly as well but he just mixed it  with his sweat tea to cut the taste. The second time the service was even slower.  My wife ordered the wedge with no onions again, and again the waitress brought out one with onions.  The service is just too slow and there is nothing special about the food or cocktails. I would rather go to the TGI Fridays or Applebee's  across the street than come her again just to be disappointed."

1,"I visited Fogo de Ch\u00e3o this week for lunch and it was great. \n\nSalad Bar: You can easily fill up on the salad bar. Great selection and everything looked fresh.\n\nMeats: The usual meats offered at other Brazilian steakhouses and everything I had was delicious. I often had to turn my card over so I could work on finishing what was starting to pile up. \n\nService: Service was great, plenty of attention with drink refills, offering meats, etc. There was a pretty decent lunch crowd but each time I turned my card over instantly someone was by my table ready to offer more meat."
0,Very disappointing. The steaks we had were either under done or over done. \n\nWe ended paying 70 bucks per steak. Not even worth 10 bucks. Outback steak house makes better steaks than this place.

0,"Atmosphere is nice bar/pub style with outside seating. Staff is friendly but service is slow. I had dinner there alone at 6pm on a weekday and it took them 30 min to bring the incorrect order then another 5 min to correct it. I am visiting this area, but where I come from a Medium burger means pink in the middle. My late arriving burger was burned on the outside and cooked all the way thru.  Sweet potato tots were sweet and tasty. Overall, just okay. Nothing special. Probably would not come here again.  Lots of great restaurants to try."
0,"Used a mail-in coupon for smog check because this location offered free car wash with purchase. \n\nHowever, this location sent you to another one to get your free car wash. Inconvenient.

They never seem to be able to help find your stuff and on more than one occasion I have had to deal with someone extremely rude. \n\nHowever, since this review is for this store only, I have to say that the guys who work here are pretty nice. And this place is a one stop shop for shipping (USPS and UPS), copying, faxing, making copies of keys, etc. that is conveniently located right across the street from where I work. I use it frequently to drop of outgoing mail or pick up stamps. But for anything more complicated, there is usually going to be a wait associated with a machine not working or the person behind the counter not knowing what they are doing. \n\nA perfect example of this is today when I went in to have a passport photo taken. The whole process took over 45 minutes and left me with an uneasy feeling that maybe what I submitted is not a proper photo. It took three tries of taking the picture, then fiddling with it on the computer and trying to get it printed in the proper size. When he finally handed me a usable photo, I fortunately noticed that it was not printed on photo paper and so he had to print again. After all that, I was pretty frustrated since I probably could have done it faster myself at home but I wanted it \""professionally\"" done so that I was sure it was right but now I had no confidence in them at all. But David was so apologetic and graciously gave me the photo and also a padded envelope to mail off the form in for free. That is the only thing that kept them from a 1 star review."
0,"I've visited Big Fat Greek Express a few times before. Their Tempe location is half counter-deli style, half open bar area. Generally, they have enticing daily specials, a good range of drinks to include teas, and the same general quality of food as the regular chain restaurant. \n\nToday, however, was the last time I will step foot in that establishment. Upon entering from the arid desert heat, all I wanted was my usual: the lunch gyro with greek fries, olives, and a drink. This runs me $10, and leaves me a little fatter, a little happier, and ready to brave the desert sun for another few hours. \n\nApproaching the counter, thankfully sans line, the petite young brunette behind the counter greeted me quietly. I repeated my normal order, assuming that I spoke the proper lingo to avoid any follow up questions. To my surprise, I was informed that I had not, in fact, been ordering a real menu item. Apparently, I have been dreaming the past few times I visited, because what I really wanted to order was a lunch order of gyro meat. Uhhh, no, miss, I just want my gyro wrap, please. She tapped the menu angrily, speaking down to me like I was a petulant child who did not understand how this process works. \n\nLet me explain that I am about the least difficult customer a server can ask for. I usually grant any request that makes their life easier, since at the end of the day I want everyone to go home to their wife/husband/cat/dog/bird/fish happy. So, when restaurant denizens harass me over my greek fries, I am pretty taken aback.\n\nI nearly walked out, but to be honest the idea of taking another step in the sun without some iced tea was not on the radar. I said \""whatever, just give me what you kept tapping.\"" To add insult to injury, she made me repeat back what SHE told me I was ordering, not what I wanted. Upon receiving my food, I found that I had received exactly six strips of gyro meat, two pita quarters, and a gigantic mound of greek fries. Arteries? Who needs arteries? For sissies, I always say.\n\nOf course, where do I go to tell the world of my mistreatment? Yelp, of course! However, I needed the wifi password...from none other than the angry-eyed gatekeeper at the counter. After delicately extracting the information I needed, again being spoken to like I'm the chambermaid, I logged on to their gracious free Wi-Fi to share my tale. \n\nIn short, Big Fat, you have spectacular food, but I will never forget being mistreated, and for that reason I will not return."
0,"Delivered half an hour later than quoted. Pizza was cold, the driver not particularly polite, and they didn't bother to include the marinara cups that they charged EXTRA for to go with our stuffed cheesy bread. There was next to no cheese or toppings on the pizza. The stuffed cheesy bread was pretty good, or at least could have been if it had the marinara sauce. \n\nIt's the first time I've ordered from Domino's in years, because the Handmade Pan looked good. It looks nothing the ads, which I know to expect. \n\nStill, it would have been nice if they could have gotten right."
1,This is the best nail shop I've been to in Las Vegas & Henderson!! The shop has a spa like atmosphere & the staff is extremely skilled! I got a gel mani & they did an excellent manicure & massage first which normally most places rush through. In addition they were amazing at handling all our design requests. There were 7 of us for a birthday party girls spa day & they made all our designs perfect & even served us champagne & strawberries!!! LOVE
0,"Not impressed. I was with a large group, so that might have been that. I was late and everyone else had already ordered. The server acknowledged me as the straggler or so I thought. I asked for a drink menu and a regular menu and he gave me the drink menu and he came back to the other end of the table a couple times leaving me still drink-less. After that he didn't ask about food and one of the guys in my party went up to him to tell him I was still looking to order. Everyone else received their food before I even ordered. I should have just given up right there, but I was starving. I ordered the apocalypse sow with salad. Not as good as I expected. I felt it was dry and lacking flavor. The aoli was just plopped in the middle. The meat was crumbling and I had to just eat it with a knife and fork. Should have just got the soup."
1,"Okay so here is the low down on Mac Shacks Wednesday soft opening. Walking in was a little confusing, I thought i would need to give my name or something to Verify that I was on \"" The List\"" but that did not happen. So we approached the register where the very friendly staff greeted us and began to give us the rundown at our request. We ended up ordering the pepper-jack mac and the asiago blue mac with 2 salads. \n\nBy the time that we got our seat situated outside with the fellow yelpers and began to kick off the conversations the food was arriving. The salad was good, it is very hard to go wrong with a garden salad and the pepper-jack mac, well... That was quite good. This product really beats the blue box. Next time I would play chef and add some chopped up jalapeno into it. \n\nBecky ordered the Asiago mac and cheese and it was also very good. I am not a huge fan of bleu cheese but this had a great flavor and was well executed. \n\nThe atmosphere fits the food, it has the hustle bustle feel, not that may be due to the fact that they were quite busy but it seemed very fast paced in there. I really don't have any complaints, the only thing I found odd was the plates and the way that they serve the food. What is with the tin with the newspaper or whatever it is with a fake wood bowl in it.... That is my only, \"" Meh\"" moment. \n\nGood luck mac shack and thanks for having us. Also, I swear I really did RSVP."

0,"Unprofessional, lack of communication, couldn't do anything right the first time, and just don't care.  After meeting Randy Appel, whom seemed like he knew what he was doing, we decided to give a deposit of five thousand dollars.  Work did not start until almost three weeks later-which put us back on our timeline.  After the concrete was poured, we were left with splashes of grey and residue on our walls that we were told \""just washes off with water\"" and the plastic sticking out of the concrete.  Both of these were left to us to clean up and pull out on our own.  Then we had drywall put in.  What a nightmare!  In one day, we had more than five different guys show up, one seeming more clueless than the one before to pick up where the other left off.  It almost seemed like they were picking people up off the street-it is no exaggeration, there was really that big of a rotation. They \""forgot\"" their circular saw, so did the holes for our can lighting by hand, and they made the holes larger than the metal housing for almost ALL of the ceiling lights and they did not put the walls butting up against the ceiling, nor against each board.  Many were crooked and needed to be taken down and put back up. Two areas of wall did not meet the edge of the counter, and a vent hole was off center from where it needed to be by almost five inches. One guy made us extremely uncomfortable by cussing and mumbling under his breath when he couldn't get the board in right.  Even when they came back 3 separate times, they still did not get it right.  We eventually counted 17 different areas where they needed to come back and fix areas, during their fourth try.   Then, shortly after the drywall was put in (and before we could change our mind about continuing services with them because we were pressed to move in and we had run so far behind schedule) we had them install a house full of tile.  We were asked by Randy Appel to lay out our tile the way we wanted the install to be put in, so we did.  I decided to come by unannounced, because at that point, I did not trust these people. I am glad I did, because the workers had done a fourth of the family room the WRONG way.  They argued with me about how the box was telling them the recommended way, and that the way I showed the owner was not on the box.  I am not sure why I had to argue with them, but when I asked them to put it in differently, and closer to the wall, they told me to go back to my rental and \""have a cerveza\"".  I told the manager Matt, but he told me that maybe I \""needed one.\""  I was very offended.  After they left more than a half an inch un-tiled against the wall, I told them that they needed to fill in the gaps because my floor board molding would not cover the gap.  I had to have them come back three times to repair areas where there was no grout, and places were tile needed to be repaired because they put in chipped tiles and left them, instead of picking from my extras for better pieces.  the fourth time they came back for that repair, we found twelve areas that needed repair.  They also did not seal the grout, which I have to do myself now.  This company NEVER apologized or made any attempt to make the customer happy.  They just kept sending the same inept people over and over again.  Matt the manager told me that he \""didn't like to get his hands dirty\"" and maybe this is why we had to deal with unskilled workers.  We were originally scheduled to have this company redo our roof too, but we decided we had enough time to go with someone else, because we realized that they just don't care.  The company also has three different names:  Global Green (which is who charged us via our debit card), R & D Appel (which is on their receipts telling people who to make the checks out to- and the initials of the owners, one of whom is Randy Appel), and the Edge Remodeling (which we were told was being phased out, but is listed on the top of the same receipt as R & D Appel).  It seems a little strange to have three different names for their company.  They also have three different licenses:  ROC: 2082348Com, 237727Res, and 213782Res.  So there's your information, you decide whether its something you or your family want to go through when you use this contractor for your remodel.\n\nAfter reading the response of one of the owners (whom I have never met, and never spoke to) I have to say that he has not seen the finished product of the work that I described here-no manager has ever walked through after the last work was done, and I still have problems with the areas I listed.  I have pictures and emails to prove what I went through, and what I still have problems with. This company tried to refute my opinion online-without ever talking with me about those issues when I made every attempt to do so, previously to writing this review. Maybe if they had communicated with me about my concerns that I DID bring up to them, I wouldn't have left this review. What I wrote is true."
0,"No. Just... no.\n\nI usually write very thorough and detailed reviews on yelp, and yet... I can't even bring myself to write an actual review for this club.\n\nPlease spend your time in Vegas somewhere else. Las Vegas is all about novelty. LAX is one of the older nightclubs inside one of the older casinos (The Luxor). You can find better music and better people at the newer clubs inside the newer hotels."

La Fonda is it.  For me, it's all about the enchilada sauce and La Fonda's is very good.  The food is reasonably priced and easy for take out."

0,"The Capri on Camelback has an amazing location!  Walking distance to newly opened Fresh and Easy, Chelsea's Kitchen, Vincent's, Postino, LGO, and the Vig.  It's exactly what you want in walking distance to home.  \n\nFrom the looks of it from the outside, it looks drab and boring, but inside, the apartments are quite nice... nothing to write home about, but nice.  \n\nWhy the low score?  The Parking is a nightmare!!!!!!!!!  It's the worst possible thing I can imagine!  To go through that headache every single day is become too much.  Every car is parked within inches (INCHES) of each other... and to top it off my truck has been spit on twice.  The staff knows little to nothing.  The laundry is expensive.  And it's like college where every other night a fire alarm gets pulled.  Plus, every single morning from between 7 - 10 am they are dragging metal dumpsters or trimming the hedges or cutting the grass or blowing the grass or etc, etc, etc.  You CANNOT sleep in with the windows open... even weekends.\n\nBut the worst thing... in an apartment complex with easily well over 500 people living here, there is NO RECYCLING!  I cannot believe this, in this day in age.  No recycling.  Unacceptable."
0,"*This is a review of an experience at Meatballz  on 1.8.10 and also my first time there.\n\nI was going out to lunch with a couple of work buddies and meeting up with another friend who suggested we go to Meatballz for lunch. He had been raving about the food for some time and I figured, it's a Friday and I have not yet tried it, so I will give it a shot.  We met at about noon and there was a total of six of us. I was very excited looking over the large menu of various heroes and pastas. \n\nFor those that have never been here, you order at the counter and then the food is brought out to you.  I was the fifth out of six of us to order. 4 people ordered meatball heroes, one person a tuna hero (yes at a place called Meatballz) and I ordered the chicken parm hero and a small drink for $9.12 after the guy at the counter taking the order recommended it over the heroes I was considering. Not the cheapest lunch out there, but for a fresh foot long hero and a drink with free refills it is completely par for the course.  \n\nThe six of us were lucky enough to find a table we could all sit at inside . It looks like they may be able to sit about 30 or so folks and there is some seating outside as well.  About 5 to 10 minutes after the last person had ordered, all of the heroes started to come out, except for one. For 5 points can you guess which one? If you said Tuna, you get no points. For those of you that guessed Chicken parm, give yourselves the points. About 30 minutes later and still no sandwich I decided to hit the counter up for an explanation. \n\nI was told that there was a fresh sandwich coming out of the oven and that it would be out in a moment. By that point I had waited about a half hour, the other five folks I was with had finished or were in the final stretch of finishing their sandwiches so I just asked for my money back.  \n\nThankfully the guy behind the counter (who is the reason this review has any stars attached to it) was extremely customer service oriented and apologized for the mistake and gave me back my money. Just as I was getting the money back a sandwich did come out from the back but it was too late and I didn't have time to eat nor the desire. I was happy that there was no fuss on returning my cash and let the cashier know that it wasn't his fault that there was a mix up.  \n\nA few moments later the same guy came around the counter and told me he had spoken to his boss and they felt bad. They gave me a 10 dollar gift certificate to come back and try the place again and I appreciate that, but it may be some time before I take them up on the offer. \n\nThere are a ton of places looking for lunch time business and this one is a bit out of the way for me at this point. With restaurants closing in the valley all the time I am sure having unhappy or unsatisfied customers is not something anyone wants. While I do appreciate the attempt at getting me back in, I am going to have to let the bad taste of nothingness leave my mouth first  It is possible at some point I may go back in there, but until that day comes I am going to have to leave this review at a 2 star."
0,"First time here last night.  Live jazz combo was great, but the food was just ok and quite over-priced.  Our server was fair at best."
1,"While their merchandise is awesome, the staff is polite to a point which writing a review praising their awesomeness is warranted. The only qualms I have about Sunshine Daydream is their disclaimer about their pipes stating: \""Pipes are for tobacco use only\"". Really? I can understand if they need it for legal reasons, but odds are that the disclaimer will be largely ignored by a majority of their patrons."

1,"I've been wanting to come to Marche' for a long, long time. You won't ever run into this restaurant unless you go into the Desert Shores housing community so it's a hidden gem that some people may not even know is there. I did, because I tried unsuccessfully to buy a house here and got outbid at every corner.\n\nAngela H. put on a Sunday brunch UYE and we had prime patio seating for it. If it's nice out - take advantage of it! It's a shaded patio over looking the lake and has vines and potted plants giving a feel of being in someones lovely yard. It was busy, but not crowded in feeling and was a pleasant vibe for all of us to converse. \n\nI came late, but they were able to get my food out to me in a jiffy and our server was very pleasant. I had the buckwheat crepes with mushrooms and chicken. The sauce was pleasant and creamy and had to be sopped up with some bread, chicken was cooked right and I like the mushrooms were a mix of beech and oyster. The salad with it was a nice mix of greens with a hint of orange in the vinaigrette. \n\nI don't know why I haven't gone here sooner, but probably because my ego is bruised that I don't get to walk her from my backyard to brunch at the lake. I most definitely will be back as it's prime outdoor dining weather and the food was solid. I will be back for their weekday lunch special pre fixe as that seems like a great deal!"
0,"Wish we had read the reviews on here before we had taken a chance on this place... Definitely not a place you would return to for the food, that's for sure.\n\nWe were charged $2.25 each for sodas/tea, $5 for a bowl of clearly Kraft Macaroni n Cheese for our toddler... 2 Entr\u00e9es at $12.99-15.99... It was $42 before tip for 2 adults and a toddler... all for very blah, unremarkable food. They even charged an extra $1 for a couple extra flour tortillas, a \""service\"" that should be thrown in for free.\n\nOur server disappeared quite a bit, and the female owner/manager or whomever was more attentive to us... we saw her even have to prompt him to come over and tend to us at one point.\n\nAgain, this is basically a sports bar fronting as a mexican restaurant... we won't be fooled again!"
1,"This place has the best sandwiches ever and is home of the stop sign pizza. \n\nThere is nothing special about the sandwiches but, damn they are good. The fresh italian bread, the juice cuts of meat. This sandwich (the one I get) had italian dressing, mayo, lettuce, tomatoe, no onion turkey, black forest ham and cheese. You also get some pepperchinis on the side. Like I said nothing special, but still there is something about the meat and the fresh brad that totally makes this sandwich. \nThe stop sign pizza is great for a family or a get to gather. Literally the size of a stop sign. It's like 35ish dollars and you have to pre-order it but it has like 30-40 slices (squared). \nBeen going here for the past 12 years. I do only get the ham and turkey sandwich and have to admit that I have not had any of the other sandwiches. I do hear that the other selections are good too. \nThe place may look a little scary, both the neighborhood and the inside. Don't let it turn you off to this place. Give it a try"
1,"OK, what made this visit so special that compelled me to give it 5-Stars overall was the Staff.  Lawry's does, in fact, employs wonderful people.  The Maitre D, was personable and very prompt with seating our group exactly at the time of our 6 o'clock reservation. Amazing.  Then we spent an evening with the wonderful and comedic Mrs. Lauren Post.  Sorry for the publicity, Mrs. Post but you made my family of six feel at ease which gave us a wonderful start to our Vegas trip together.\nMan I just realized that I haven't even mentioned food yet? WOW? If that isn't saying something I don't know what else would?  \nOk the food Is WITHOUT a doubt, DEVINE and heaven sent.  God bless the owners and every cook that had a part of my meal.  Thank you LAWRY's."
1,"Per Mandi L.'s suggestion we purchased a Travel Zoo voucher good for 2 people for $35 for any night of the week at the Bistro Buffet.. She had raved about the crab legs so we made sure to come hungry! No wait on a Saturday at 6pm so in we went to join her table... The buffet is small and so the selections are few compared to other buffets but man I was impressed with the seafood selection.. \n\nThey have shrimp, oysters and cold crab legs in the salad section.. The line may look long but it moves pretty fast.. While waiting in line the chefs offer the option of hot crab legs.. I definitely recommend this because they do not skimp on the amount of yummy crab legs they fill your plate with and it saves you the time of having to sort through the cold crab legs. \n\nThey also have crawfish, mussels, salmon and many other seafood options.. AYCD beer and wine are also included with your meal and we definitely took advantage of the white wine!\n\nCon: Dessert section is limited.. \n\nHOT TIP: Fridays and Saturdays are their seafood nights"
0,"Pretty disappointed. Fianc\u00e9 and I went to check this place out because all the great reviews. Went in and were seated right away, and greeted by our server (Jessica) who started the greeting by asking if we'd like something to drink. \""Would you guys like a glass of wine, a martini, a beer....are you even old enough to drink??! You look so young.\"" This really threw me off because of the fact that we are definitely \""old enough\"" and her tone when saying that just came off rude. \n\nAnyways, we order. Food was pretty good. But a bit pricey for the portions. The other few servers who checked on us and filled our water were nice. Our server checked when we had our entrees briefly, so we weren't ignored, but it felt like we weren't taken very seriously. Most likely won't be returning.."

0,"I'm sorry to say it, but the only two things this place has going for it are a cool name and toasty buns. Even the sauce on the table was beyond dull. (I swear it's 85-90% ketchup.) \n\nI wasn't very hungry, so I decided on the slider app. They offer several different choices, including pulled pork, brisket, chicken and hot links. I picked 3 different ones to try, but naming them won't matter because none of them were anything special. I'm a sucker for a good, toasty bun, though, so I had something to keep me going. I was thinking to myself that if the food was good I would try a slice of pie to top off the meal. The food was boring, so I can only imagine the pie is a dud too. \n\nPutting the food aside for a second, I think the restaurant is pretty neat looking. It smells great. It's got a good location. I just wish the food was as great as the name."
1,"I AM A HUGE FAN OF THIS PLACE,,,,,, I found this place about 4 years ago while driving around after class and boy o' boy am i glad i did. Please don't let the name fool you they do have more than pizza and bar food, I got there often and i love the garlic knots with the chopped garlic pieces, I like to dip that in any pasta i get. Yummm........ Some times on Friday they have specials with are very budge friendly and so are the drinks. Its a cool place to go when you're out with the girls or they guys.... so check them out"
0,"A complete disappointment. The service was TERRIBLE - we were completely rushed, the waiter was rude, and the food was overpriced and mediocre. The first course (lobster bisque) came with a lot of flourish which was unfortunately limited to the presentation, not the palate. My steak was overcooked (I ordered it blue, it came back medium well) and then when the new steak arrived, it was undercooked.\n\nWhen our waiter tried to rush us through our cocktails, I instructed him to come back so we could order wine with dinner. He then came back, took our wine glasses off the table (despite my telling him we were planning to order wine) and never offered us wine service again. Steak without wine, in my book, is a minor tragedy!\n\nMy dining companions enjoyed their meals, but it was not worthy of the Daniel Boulud name nor the price tag.  A full week later, and I am still disgusted by the poor service."

1,"FIrst experience there was great!  No reservation, but got us right in and the service was fantastic.  Food was as wonderful as expected from our experiences at the chef's former restaraunt and a pretty good variety for many types of diets.  Preview of the upstairs \""private club\"" is interesting.  Will look forward to checking that out when it's ready!"
0,"This place is probably the worst place you will ever see for the service for your vehilce.  The mechanics do not seem very capable, and no one ever returns your calls.  We still do not have our radio fixed in our car that we bought there in January 2013, and they had the car for one whole week.  Do youself a favor and stay far away from this place.  The aggravation is not worth whatever deal you might possibly get there.  I will never buy from this place again for the sole reason of their terrible service."
1,"Korean cuisine is absolutely epic! Epic flavours and epic presentations of epic proportions. This is an age old and a time tested to perfection sort of cooking. \n\nAs a vegetarian dining at a Korean BBQ joint I am always thankful that I leave stuffed, satiated and pleased beyond belief.\n\nPanch'an is the general term that refers to the small side dishes that are served with any Korean meal. Kimchi is an integral part of the dining experience and it damn well should be. Kimchi is oh so good! Who the hell thought cabbage could be so interesting? Namul falls under the category of panch'an but consists of those side dishes that involve vegetables. They are absolutely delicious. The simplicity, subtlety and diversity of flavours hints at the unique and ancient quality of these recipes. My favourite namul is the kongnamul which is a beautiful cold bean sprout marinated in sesame oil and rice wine vinegar. Musaengchae is chicory tossed in a savoury hot pepper and sesame. Gogumasum is boiled potato in a light sweet vinegar. \nOi sobagi are these delicious seasoned cucumbers. Mmm my mouth is watering just at the thought of them. They come complimentary with your meal and traditionally are unlimited ... so unbuckle that belt and prepare that second and third stomach because we are going to gorge ourselves like Romans eating Korean on free appetisers all night! \n\nIf you want to stay for a main dish and not just dine and dash on excellent and free side dishes then you really must order the dolsot bibimbap! This is the archetype of warming and scrumptious down home comfort food. This is a hot stone bowl that cooks your meal right in front of your eyes. Imagine a perfectly cooked bed of wild rice; soft yet crisp on the edges. Then all the vegetables you could imagine piled sky high with some tofu then topped with an egg like a cherry on top. Add your Korean hot sauce to taste and / or the especially burn-your-mouth-off pepper concoction which they make just for themselves and yours truly. Mix, let cook as you eat and enjoy!\n\nGet the ginseng tea with the deep fried green tea ice cream afterwards. \n\nEnjoy!   !"
1,"My parents live down road and we were in town visiting them, I decided to look on Yelp for something new and different to take them for dinner. We got sat right down with very friendly service. I love older authentic home style places like this. The menu has lots of different offerings with some great choices. They serve warm chips and a couple kinds of salsas and dips (and Hot !). We all got a vast array of choices and the portions were good and tasted great. Everyone told me great choice on picking a new place and I said its all about Yelp! . They checked on us numerous times and kept the drinks full without asking . We always have gone to the other place in town but decided to change and we are very glad we did, If we lived in town we would eat here regularly !"
0,"It was ok... but not what I expected.  The burger was cooked properly but not very juicy... as if it had sat around for awhile or the meat just wasn't that fresh.  My fiance got a chicken salad and didn't enjoy that either very much either.  The service was good.  Lee has a big smile all the time but for a place that has \""burger\"" in it's name and charges $15, it should have better burgers than this.  Five guys is better..."
0,"Warning: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLACE! Terrible service! I've had multiple items on the menu, and they've all been below average. BTW, if you're looking to have a burrito with the usual items (meat, lettuce, tomato, rice, beans, etc) be prepared to have 1 menu option (The 3 lb burrito) that runs you 13-15 dollars, and MORE if you want grilled steak (of which they will give you 5-7 SMALL pieces). Margaritas are OK, but be prepared to wait."
1,"I've been hearing a lot about Five Guys' burgers, but they have not yet reached Bakersfield, CA where I live so this was my first experience with them.\n\nA sign next to cash register tells you where today's potatoes are from (Rexbury, ID  Brown's Farm).  That is just too cool.  They actually keep track of the potatoes?  It gives me the impression they take great care with everything else, too!\n\nThere are free peanuts in the shell; help yourself to as much as you like!\n\nThey have the good kind of soda machines where you can choose a variety of flavors or  mix and match.  My favorites are the Sprite Zero in raspberry, vanilla, peach, strawberry, and grape!  See, I TOLD you there were a lot a choices!\n\nThere is a predominance of red and white in their decor, especially in the checkered patterns. The black ceiling with scarlet duct work  looked great!  There was very loud music playing catchy tunes. (Pretty Woman was one of them)  The smell wafting through the restaurant is amazing \n\n\nA regular hamburger comes with two patties, and a small comes with a single patty.  The hamburger was thick and juicy and tasty!  TheCcajun fries were the best seasoned fries I've ever tasted!  I'm going to be dreaming/fantasizing about them for a long time!\n\nThere is quite a variety of customers in the restaurant.  On the day we were here, there was a  national guard unit wearing camouflage uniforms, there were young twenty something's tatted up, older couples with gray hair looking like they were heading off to the country club, and me and my coworker who were in town for the weekend doing a live broadcast of a national dance competition (just call me twinkle toes).   Apparently EVERYBODY knows that this place has the best hamburgers in town.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for?"
0,"This place infuriated me. I got there right at 10 am when they opened for their big \""blowout sale.\"" First off, there was NO parking. People parked illegally, along the road, in warehouse bays, etc. I had to walk nearly 8 minutes from the car to the entrance to this place. There were throngs of people walking all over the highway to get inside.\n\nSecond, the line to get into the sale was RIDICULOUS! I waited one hour and 20 minutes just to get inside the sale! I waited and waited and waited some more. They even have those twisty queue areas like at Disneyland and all shoppers needed a wristband to get in the sale. Once you get into the sale area, you have to wait in ANOTHER long line just to check out, then ANOTHER just to GET OUT of the place while employees check your receipt, Sam's Club style.\n\nEvery annoying soccer mom in Vegas was here with their crappy kids and their giant strollers and their Coach bags and their \""holier than thou\"" snobby attitudes. I almost lost my cool just having to be surrounded by the jerks (the typical customer for TOMS shoes, apparently). They have the special sale area corralled off so you can't see inside and now I know why -- if you saw the junk they were offering and the prices they were charging, nobody would be in line.\n\nOnce I finally got in, I was so disappointed. There were huge bins of shoes (new but no boxes) just piled in so you have to dig and dig. Also, the prices were still way too high -- about 40% off retail price. Shoes that retail brand new at Nordstrom for $45 were priced at $30. Um, no thanks. I just turned around and left. I'm still super pissed that I wasted almost 2 hours of my day for this ridiculous \""sale.\"" Don't waste your time!"
0,The last time I stayed here my room had an overpowering and sickening cigarette smell. This is supposed to be a non-smoking facility. I gave it one more try and had the same exact issue. It was sickening. They obviously don't enforce the no smoking policy and don't care about their guests very much. Never again. I complained to the front desk both time and all they did was apologize. How about fumigating those stinky rooms!
1,"Best buffet in Las Vegas on weekends! They used to make it work to eat crab legs but now cut them in half for you and still super good.almost 200 things to eat and make sure you save room for dessert because they got it all from gelato,creme brulee, eclairs, to cakes and crepes tira misu and flan just to name a few."
0,"The hot dogs are good, but every time I go there the line for ordering is unorganized and chaotic.  Sometimes I have to wait over 10 minutes to even have my order taken.  I've often been in there when people flip out because they had to wait a long time for their food, which for hot dogs, really shouldn't take that long.  I love the hot dogs there but they need some better organization for handling the orders when a lot of people come in.  Organize the line, greet people when they come in, acknowledge they're there...don't just make them sit and wonder if you saw them or if they're gonna get served.  Also, try to keep the drama out.  People have made a scene several times when I was in there and it makes me want to leave.  I don't want to witness drama when I just wanted to get a hot dog."
1,"This was a little hard to find in the back of the strip mall, but it was worth looking for. \n\nMy wife and I shared the chicken and waffles and the jalape\u00f1o biscuits and gravy.  Both were fantastic.  The menu suggests putting hot sauce and maple syrup on the chicken and waffles....YOU MUST TRY THIS! \n\nThe kids enjoyed the M&M pancakes and the chocolate waffle.  \n\nWe got there early on a Saturday morning. It was lucky that we did because they got busy in a hurry.  \n\nThe service was fantastic and the whole experience was great.  I thought the prices were very reasonable too.  It's too bad that I'm rarely down in that area. :-("
0,"In the fall of last year my wife, visiting from Flagstaff, took her 05 prius in for a regular maintenence checkup.  She was told that there was something drastic that needed repair to her car and it was expensive and it needed doing soon.  She wisely declined the job.  She returned to Flagstaff and took it immediately to the Toyota dealership in Flag and was told that there wasn't anything wrong with the car.\nThen last month, I took my 07 prius in for a tune up and was told that there was some 600.00 dollars worth of repair that needed doing.  Mainly with oil systems.\nHaving learned from my wife, I delcined the work and took it to Flagstaff and found that one of the jobs was not necessary and the other job should have been included with the tuneup that Camelback T was supposed to do.  They charged over $200. for the simple tuneup and then didn't do all the work. \nWhen you look at the facility, you'll see it's modern and expensive looking.  Perhaps from bilking unsuspecting customers with sleasy practices.\nToyota on Camelback won't see me again.  Won't see you again unless you can't learn from other peoples experiences.\nI don't know which dealership does fair and honest work but I intend to find out;\nSelling cars might be ok but repair is a gyp."
0,"Not happy with this location either. For some reason the drive-thru line winds thru the parking lot which means the parking lot is a giant clusterf..ck. Rude and slow service on top of that = very frustrated coffee drinker. \n\nBut today was super fun. We had a coupon for half off and clearly the girl in the drive-thru was not happy about it. When I asked for 2 transactions (which I do often-no problem) I got an eye roll. When I asked her to scan my daughters phone I got another eye roll and the sarcastic \""you're not the first person to come through this line today with a half off coupon.\"" Oh really? Surely at 2pm I thought I'd be the first!! I said \""oh I'm sorry I'm so annoying.\"" \n\nAnyway my drink had a nasty brown lime in it, tasted okay but customer service ruined my trip. Boo."
0,This place is the perfect example of why I stopped going to AYCE sushi bars.  Lot's of our orders never showed up and the ones that did took forever. the Quality of the food  =   . I should have known better
1,"Aizle has no menu, just a list of ingredients that may or may not show up in your food, plus a chance to explain your dietary restrictions. The meal consists of five creative courses inspired by seasonal, local produce. \n\nAizle is getting 5 stars from me because every single course delivered. Each dish brought interesting flavors to my tongue - there were no duds, no fillers. Just tastiness. The second course involved perhaps the yummiest carrots I have ever eaten.  \n\nI opted for the drinks pairing, which included a beer, three wines, and a cocktail (all small servings). The beverages complemented the food well. The cocktail (a strawberry concoction, the type of thing I would usually avoid) was particularly delicious. I'm looking forward to trying some more of their house cocktails on our next visit, which will be very soon."
0,"They have good music, good beer, but the manager is a terrible person."
1,"Wow. Very pleasantly surprised by this place. I've stayed at this hotel before and shyed away from here because when I walked up the decor just says run away. The decor is like a Denny's trying to be Mexican. Not sure if the problem is the cheap plastic plants or the lighting....but don't let it keep you from the food here. I had the Flaming Fajita plate which comes with shrimp, steak, and chicken. Also had a Cadillac Margarita. Both were great! I actually was sitting there eating and drinking and talking to myself about how surprisingly good this is. I'm pretty critical as you can tell from my other reviews, and this place is good! Service was fast and courteous too! Will be back. Wish the hotel was as good."
1,"I really kind of liked this little store. If you are needing a unique gift or just want something new for yourself, give this a try. Nicely organized. Didn't feel too cramped like some stores. Big selection. :)"
0,"Just awful experience. Horrible food, and that manager guy Tony is not very nice. I miss the old owner. Cant believe they dont take online reservations anymore. I will not return."
1,"The best aspect of this surf/turf restaurant is the atmosphere - bustling and in view of Bellagio fountains. We had to wait a few minutes even though we had a reservation, which was fine because there are two bars.  \n\n[frisee & warm bacon salad with soft-poached egg, croutons] \n-- absolutely delicious! the poached egg is an amazing addition and actually emulsifies the dressing - yum.\n\n[sea scallops, butternut squash puree, brussels sprouts, hazelnuts, brown butter]\n-- scallops were cooked perfectly, large portion but needed more salt. Squash was good but a bit bland and the brussels sprouts ok."
1,"I'm completely, 100 percent addicted to this place. Fresh, light, authentic, hot pizza. Love that I can build my own and eat my own personal pizza. Love the water station and the atmosphere, including the music! You have to know what you want tho because it's an order first, then sit place. Go. Now. You'll thank me."
0,"What a bad ending to what was a great night.  We sat relatively quickly.  We ordered a pitcher and 2 orders of guacamole.  Water came quick.  Drinks about 15 minutes, guacamole OVER 45 MINUTES.   The guac was served in little ramekins, usually used for a side of horseradish.  They must be f***ing kidding.\n\nWe had finished the pitcher and and the waiter had not been back to take the order.  I had to go to the hostess to find him.  7 minutes later, he shows up and tells us theyre working on our guac.  \n\nNow its an hour and 40 minutes and we have no sign of entrees.  I ask to speak to tje general manager.  Three different people told me she was three different places.  Im in the business and was polite but firm.  She obviously wasnt the GM and honestly, not a experienced manager. I know she was not in charge just maybe for the day. \n\nThere was an wine walk event there that night that had a ton of folks.  They werent prepared.  Whoever is really in charge, not sure whether its corporate or not, needed to be there or get called in,   They failed.   They had a line at the door and they had empty tables.  I told her the guacamole was embarrassing and didnt even realize they charged us $12.   Guardinos smokes this and much much less.  \n\nAfter three baskets of chips, and just a frustrating end to what was a great night, I didnt care about the meal.   It comes and the tacos were greasy.  The lobster on top of the paella was 2 overcooked. 1 1/2 inch lobster tails that could be snapped in half.  The soup was ok, although served 4 minutes after all other dishes and no one else thought their meal was average.\n\nA well run restaurant would have known there was an issue and tried to minimize further disaster.  Acknowledge the guests, treat them with respect.  She did get us a round of low end tequila shots (I know my tequila) and when some other lady brought them over, she tries to tell me that life is short and to try and enjoy it.  Really?  Guess she missed the customer service classes.  \n\nNice of them to also add a 18% gratuity.  This place really lets me feel glad that I dont make an effort to come to Lake Las Vegas."
1,"Beautiful decor and helpful waiters. They know the dishes enough to recommend drinks that actually go well with them. The first time I went, I had the \""Scottish Venison\"" which was superb! The venison was tender and very tasty whilst the red cabbage on the side was sweet and slightly sour. Their muscles and oysters were fresh too.\n\nDuring the second visit, I had the Cullen skink, which was quite nice and different to ones that I had in the past, as they had blended the haddock into fine pieces.\nThe waiter had recommended a lamb special, so I tried it out and was pleasantly surprised. The lamb chops were very tender and they also provided a very nice fresh mint sauce.\n\nAs for desserts, I was amazed by their summer berries crumble. It was mildly sour and quite sweet (just the way I like them).\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend coming to this place, I'm definitely coming back when I return to Edinburgh some time in the future."
1,"Geez, Mike D. TMI, TMI. But I guess it's good information for the X chromosome- but do guys really care how clean your bathroom is or how tightly the door closes???\nOkay, I digress. Well, Mike D. the Y- bathroom was just fine. Not fancy but clean.  And the door closes. \nSorry folks for the banter before I write about the food and service. \nOur group was running Ragnar and we came in here looking for a warm and hearty breakfast. I think the state we were in, anything would have tasted out of this world. And it did!\nService was friendly, helpful. The food came out fast. The price extremely reasonable. \nI love places like the Wagon Wheel where the moment you walk in, they treat you like an old friend regardless of how you look, dress, or smell. \nNot only do you get a great serving of food, you get a great serving of human decency as well. And that's worth any price and I'm sure that's one of many reasons why they have many regulars. \nIt was my first and only time here but I reckon places like these has its regulars and loyal following since I know if I lived close by, this place would be my regular go to place for breakfast!"
1,"Yummy!!\n\nPortions are humongous and that's an understatement. \n\nI ordered the chicken and waffles. It could easily feed 2+ people - comes with 2 pieces of chicken and 4 bacon waffles. I could only finish one waffle and chicken. \n\nThey have mimosas. That's always a plus.\n\nHot sauce isn't automatically a condiment that comes with the meal which is a boo but they had sriracha when I asked. So all good. \n\nHad to ask for extra maple syrup. I'm not a syrup whore but for the amount of food, I had to ask for more syrup. \n\nAll the people who work there were super chill and nice."
1,"Great atmosphere, great bartenders, great beer, pretty good clientele... my only complaints are that it can get pretty smokey in there at time and that they are not closer to my house."
1,One of the better steakhouses @ Vegas. I am a huge fan. Best restaurant in New York New York casino. Ribeye is probably the best. Great wine selection as well. Creme of spinach + potatoes are also very good.
0,"Was it just an off night? I had high hopes for this place and was sorely disappointed. Went on a Monday and the place was dead. I know my fellow yelpers may stone me for this review but here goes:\n\nTo start - I found the d\u00e9cor to look a bit cheesy, like design on a dime but they only spent a nickel.. What's up with the glass jars full of paper confetti? The music was too loud and the lights kept getting darker and darker, by the time we got our food we could barely see.\n\nOur waitress was nice and recommended her favorites. So many people have raved about this place, but I found the fusion either bland or overspiced. \n\nShabu Hot and Sour was served first - This soup had no spice to it at all, even the side dipping sauce provided had no spice. The lime broth, while providing nice flavor to the veggies was too overpowering to eat, so we just picked out all the veggies. \n\nSpicy Wontons came out next - Chicken and pepper jack.. This tasted as though it had been frozen for ages, no flavor and very little amount of chicken.\n\nVolcano Beef - Nice touch on the \""sear it yourself\"" hot rock. We could see the beef was marinated, but we couldn't taste it and the garnish accompanying it was loaded with too much ginger. \n\nAt this point we were so disappointed with the food, and still hungry. We left and walked down the street to Moira, another disappointment. Review to follow."
1,"My husband and I were out looking for security doors for our house. We stopped by Lowe's to have a look at their selection.Within a couple of minutes someone was there, Frankie if I recall correctly, asking if we needed help. We said we were just looking and he said he'd be in lumber if we changed our mind.\nWe eventually decided to go to \""the other home improvement store\"" to compare prices and selection. We were there for about 45 min. and was not helped ONCE!!!!!! Oh sure we saw about half a dozen employees walk by, some even mention that \""that wasn't their department\"" and my husband even went to the front desk and still nothing. We gave up and went back to Lowe's.\nOnce again, super easy to find Frankie again and while we were placing our order the computer wasn't working right and the manager was there pronto.\nFrom the beginning to the end (the purchasing, the setting up of the instillation, the instillation, etc.) was right on point. Everyone was very professional and friendly. I will shopping at this Lowe's for all my future home improvement purchases."
1,My first time here.  Food was great!  Large portions at a good price.  Great looking place too. Super clean and nice.  Had an outdoor sitting area with misters as well.  Service was GREAT!  So friendly and helpful!  Our servers last time we Fariba and Sayed and couldnt have asked for better staff!  I will definitely be back here!\nOh and they had a GREAT belly dancer to see on this saturday night while we ate!  Good addition!
1,Great local bar right down the street from me. They have a great menu with a variety to choose from. The food is very good for your typical bar food. They also have a dining area separate from the bar. Good spot to watch the games.
0,"Based on all the reviews here we gave this a try. I don't think we have ever been so dissatisfied at any other restaurant, that we have been to. My wife ordered fettuccine, with Alfredo sauce. It was like water, without taste. And mine was angel hair pasta with tomato sauce, and it wasn't any more flavorful, than hers was. I did like the warm bread, but the olive oil and vinegar to dip the bread in, had far too much vinegar. And we had to wait for quite a while, for the food to arrive. We were expecting a very good meal, and were very disappointed."
1,Great 'old school' barber.  My father went to Benny years ago and now I have been going to him.  Straight razor cut and shave is top notch.  Would recommend to anyone who asks.
1,"I was in town for a conference and I tried to get reservations but had to sit at the bar instead. Since I travel about 200 days a year and eat out a great deal, I thought I was get the customary average service at the bar but I was in for a big surprise!\n\nI was impressed that all three bartenders, Alan, Amanda, and Oscar, were not only working as an experienced team, but they were extremely knowledgeable about food and wine. The recommendation was the asparagus soup, which was brilliant and went very well with the breads presented. I had the beef wellington (after you watch 1,000's cooked on Hell's Kitchen, what else are you supposed to have?) which was perfectly cooked. The sorbet was a perfect top-off to an enjoyable meal. By the time I left, I felt that Alan, Amanda, and Oscar were not there just to serve me wine and food but to help me enjoy the whole experience of Gordon Ramsay Steak.\n\nI guess you become a Michelin star chef by perfecting your cooking and an excellent restauranteur by hiring people like Alan, Amanda, and Oscar. Thank you for such a wonderful experience!"
0,"Went here for breakfast today. Got the plain bagel with plain cream cheese and breakfast burrito with sausage. Have to say that I'm not impressed and the burro was very very bland. I give this place a \""meh\""."
0,Eh we've had better. Way better. Place looked liked a prepubescent teenagers bedroom - messy and dirty. Drinks barely had any ice. Over priced for what it was. Won't be back.
0,"This restaurant is a let down to the Mint Hill area. As soon as you walk in the door the lack of customer service is apparent, when you get seated good luck with your server I have had 3 and only one was not inattentive. The food is not consistent it is prepared differently I assume by the different cooks. It's over priced bar food that doesn't even live up to the standard of bar food. And if your decided to talk to a manger they will give you an ear full of excuses for lack service and mediocre food."
0,"This place hands down is nasty I had to be asked 4 times what did I order and when I finally got it.. it wasn't even wrapped all the way closed and they just threw it in a bag. The chicken it was so nasty, burnt and tasted old. The guy on the front line was rude and all over the place it was way to loud in there and it was more like a playground then a restaurant..."
0,"*bed bugs* Stayed here for a conference this week. The place is big and they seem to have nice pools and lounge areas, however, our room smelled bad... Like musty and also like smoke. I really was unhappy with the smell. My girlfriends and I stayed in two separate rooms. After the first night one of my gf's woke up with 6-7 bites and was left uncomfortable and itching the entire trip. The second night of our stay ( i was staying in a different room) I was also bit! I went to sleep fine and woke up with two bites on my ankles. Just a side note, we never had the doors open and we were in two separate rooms.  We both sleep with the blankets covering us as well so I have determined that this is most likely a bed bug issue. My last night I was bit again twice and now I'm home and happy to be here. I am frustrated though that I am itching like crazy, just felt dirty yuck! I gave two stars because the facility is nice, but I don't think getting bit is acceptable."
1,It's now (5/4/13) called Windy City Cafe. Good food!
0,"So after reading all these reviews I thought to take a chance so I went to explore.  I arrived for lunch at 11am and was seated immediately.  The atmosphere was ok, and the bar looked a bit disorganized.  I ordered the the sesame chicken and egg drop soup.  I asked if I could pay extra for shrimp fried rice but was told no.  I chose the fried rice vs white or brown.  Soup came out first which I found to be very bland and very few pieces of egg in it.  On my 4th spoonful my meal arrived and I was not impressed by the way it looked.  The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce.  Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland.  The fried rice looked like it was done in a hurry with many white spots in it and with little taste.  The egg role wasn't bad although they did not serve with hot mustard sauce.  I will not be returning to this place."
0,"How UMC got ranked \""best\"" hospital in Vegas and ranked among the top in the nation is beyond me. Pharmacy wait time to drop off scripts is 1+ hours. Filling scripts takes up to 36 hours. Picking up scripts is 2+ hours. Paperwork gets lost. Patients aren't notified. Scripts aren't filled and forgotten about. Scripts that do get filled are returned to the shelf if you don't pick up within their arbitrary time frame which they claim is a week but in reality was less. Wait time for an ultrasound took me 3+ hours and would've taken liner if I didn't complain. Somehow my paperwork got lost between the front desk and 10 feet to the tech. No wonder people self medicate."
1,"awesome dumplings and delicious soup ! also i had the orange chicken and it tasted awesome! fast service great food, perfect lunch!"
0,"Wanted to try Thailicious based on the reviews, sadly we were very disappointed. Went in on a Friday night around 5:30, one other table was seated when we arrived. Most of the staff seemed disinterested in serving us and were running back and forth between the kitchen and dining area. Our server only half paid attention and served us one order of spring rolls instead of the 2 we ordered. Very mediocre at  $5.99 for two rolls, glad she only brought one order. It sounds like an exaggeration but we sat and waited for our entrees while other tables seated after us were served and eating.\n\nWe had one of the most expensive dishes on the menu, a Thai seafood entree that I can't remember the name of right now. It had a nice chili spice but was heavy with sugar which was overpowering. The Drunken noodles were OK but nothing special. Sadly we have no desire for another trip to Thailicious, there are much better Thai and Vietnamese offerings in the east valley."
1,I just went there there for lunch today.  The food was good and it was a great price.
0,"Absolutely the worst place, If you are trying to loose your ride take it her. My wife took my Passat for oil change for the past 9 month!!! When she found they refill the synthetic for the of the service...!!!! Right? Sounds like great deal... Not knowing they are using recycled oil or something... I found out when my Passat had starting making noise and the engine starting making loud noise!!! The oil change did not last 100 miles!!! The oil that the dealer showed me was black dark, thick and dirty. Now why after 100 mile from an oil change do I see a synthetic oil as dark as tar... Save money and your car. Never would I bring my cars to this place."
1,I came here for my birthday and had so much fun dancing - the DJ was great!! Great atmosphere and nice space - I loved the wall of booze that was colorfully backlit behind the bar. \n\nI love Mandalay and when I come back I will def head back to Rumjungle for some booty-shakin!
0,The place is dirty and the staff are rude!  They treat you like you are bothering them...angry and nasty!!  The bathrooms stink and are never clean.  Don't go here.
1,"My boyfriend & I arrived in Vegas on a Sunday evening and we were both starving! So he told me to yelp up some place good to eat and Rosemary's was the first place that showed up on my phone. \n\nThe place is off the strip. We walked in, and they greeted us and told us that if we wanted to dine inside the other room, we would have to wait about 45 minutes. We were both starving, so we didn't want to wait so they seated us at this table in the corner of the outside room. We later understand why they did that. Apparently this is a \""fine-dining\"" meaning, everyone supposed to dress all semi-formal-ish. Yelp didn't tell us that, so we showed up in shorts and flip-flops. OOPS. But it's okay, we had the table with the comfy chairs :)\n\nOur waitress is super nice and was willing to assist us with our menu due to the fact that this was our first time. She recommended us to the prix-fixe meal. The prix-fixe meal is $55 3-course meal of your choice. When most entrees on the menu are over  $30, by going with the prix-fixe, you're getting more food for a much better price.\n\nNow, lets talk about their service. I've never been to a place with such excellent service as Rosemary's. Everyone is so polite and attentive to your needs. I'd have to give a 5 stars for their service!"
1,"The market forces them to have less bonchon selection, but grateful they are here.\n\n(Dolsot bibimbap - pictured)"
1,Steak tacos all day long...they are so good!! Bartenders are friendly. The only downside is that is a small area.
0,"Went here for an early dinner. My group of three was one of two tables in the entire restaurant. First it was happy our and we attempted to order drinks from the happy hour menu only to be informed that we could only get the happy hour prices at the bar and we would have to say in there to receive happy hour pricing. After some further inquiry the waitress said she would allow us to order from the happy hour menu. We got chips, salsa and guacamole for an appetizer and it was mediocre at best. The tamales were good but not worth the $79 tab we incurred with an appetizer 2 drinks on happy hour and three entr\u00e9es."
0,"This place was about as bad as an airport bar and restaurant can get.  When I first walked up and asked if they had power outlets to charge my phone while I got a beer and burger, the bar tender rolled her eyes and acted like I was asking an unreasonable question.  Do to the limited choices, I stayed anyways, but should have ran.  They are not a brewing company, just a bar with basic beers.  The worst part of the entire experience was the burger.  Completely disgusting!  Do not order a burger.  It was a frozen meat concoction that tasted more like fillers than beef.  My came out pink all the way through and bar tender said that is how they cook them.  I took two bites and could not finish it.  Horrible experience and still a dead phone....errrr....what a waste of time and money."
1,"My first time here and I like the place. Great bar, not too crowded and  the servers are nice and friendly.  Make sure to order the Angus beef burger with baby spinach and cheddar cheese. Definitely will come back to this place."
0,"I would not book with this company, they make appointments, only to cancel them again and again. Yes, I tried to use their service, but after the THIRD cancellation, I gave up. Save yourself the trouble!"
1,They make some mighty fine bacon at this place. Supposedly the head chef also operates a farm that raises their own hogs so it's no wonder their pork products are really top notch.\n\nI thought the home fries which included sweet potatoes in addition to the norm was also noticeably tasty.
1,"How do you know that you received a good haircut?\nWhen you not only feel great when you look in the mirror, but you get compliments left and right from family, friends, and colleagues.\n\nI went to see Laur\u00e9n recently and took advantage of their Yelp special, which at the time was \""get a signature SHINE treatment, therapeutic scalp massage and an eyebrow shaping FREE with any hair service.\""  While I love the salon I'd been going to for years, I just wanted to change it up, so that's exactly what I did (or what Laur\u00e9n and Mindy did for me).\n\nMindy handled the SHINE treatment, wash, scalp massage, and brow shaping and did an incredible job... and then I was back in Laur\u00e9n's chair where I felt comfortable immediately.  I knew I was in good hands!\n\nI told Laur\u00e9n I wanted some shorter layers and I told her about my normal routine (which is drying my hair on a good day and leaving the house with a wet head on other days).  She gave me some great suggestions (ie: big hot rollers) as she cut and dried my hair.  I was extremely pleased with my hair when I left.  It was exactly what I wanted!\n\nI found the pricing reasonable, the Root's atmosphere pleasant, and all of the girls extremely friendly.  If you're looking for a fabulous salon, look no further than The Root!"
0,"HORRIBLE place, food was absolutely disgusting. Greasy burger for like 15 dollars. I definitely said why did I eat here in my head after I left"
0,"Horrible hotel.  Due to construction, $7 shuttle drop-off from the airport is a good 1/4 mile walk to hotel entrance.  Not great for dragging luggage on a hot day.  Next was a very long wait in the Rewards Check in line, which was MUCH shorter than the non Rewards line.  Lost reservations and no replacement room available at that price didn't help, but for only $40 more, we were able to get a room for the night.  In our room, we were able to call and make a new reservation with no mention of lost reservation for the rest of the week at original price, no problem.  \n\nI only saw one map in the whole building, a touchscreen map near the check in area.  It was only working one time during the week we were there.  You get a tiny map of the 1st floor as you check in, but it's outdated, and the writing too small to read without a magnifying glass.  No you are here fire escape map on the hotel room doors or in any binders like you see in most hotels. \n\nNo fridge, microwave, coffee maker (all extra $$).  WiFi is free for one device with the $13 mandatory daily resort charge.  We ended up cheating and turning one of our computers into a secure hot spot for the rest of our gadgets.  Trip to Wal-Mart and the purchase of a cheapy ice-chest replaced the $13 a day refrigerator charge.  It also held more than the fridge they offered. The 12 pack of soda purchased for $3.50 at Wal-Mart replaced the $4 a bottle of Pepsi charge downstairs.  \n\nMold in the bathroom pretty bad.  If you are 6' 6\"", you will have to bend to even stand in the tub due to the low ceiling clearance.  At 6'2\"", I still ended up getting shampoo on the ceiling.  Bathroom sink very low..  Ceiling in hotel hallways very low also, and waves and tears in hallway carpet easy to trip over. Elevators pretty fast, which was nice.\n\nSupposed clogged drain somewhere that was going to flood the hotel by morning woke us up at 3 am when maintenance started fishing the pipe somewhere in the building.  It took them 1/2 hour to resolve that issue, and only another hour for me to get back to sleep. Two more nights sleep were interrupted when the extremely loud announcement from our room's wall speaker notified us a few times that the cause of the alarm (that we didn't even hear) has been determined and there is no cause for alarm. I can only assume that it was a building wide announcement for something that happened in the casino.  On the 14th floor in the Habitat wing, noise from the adult only pool area sounds like loud haunted wailing.  \n\nHad a full face waxing done in the spa.  Spa was totally empty at 10 in the morning.  Just me and two employees.  Once back in their waxing area, I was told that I had to pay an extra $20 to have my cheek area also waxed.  The ended up missing the side burn area all together, which ended up looking very funny once I noticed.  \n\nAll in all, this hotel SUCKS!  Over charging and then nickle and diming everywhere you look.  Customer service also sucks, though our housekeeper was nice and knew what room we were from.  If we ever come back to Las Vegas (which is very doubtful), we won't be staying here."
0,"I have been going here for 10 years, mainly for Tara and Denny. The staff here is amazing and you feel like family until Dr.  DOOM comes into the room.  He told me I had 4 cavities I need fixed right away and what life style change have I had in the last year.  I told him I have been taking better care of my teeth than I ever had before and he told me to stop.  I didn't feel right about all the procedures he wanted to do so I went for a second opinion.  The new dentist said I had tooth decay on one tooth and we would keep an eye on it, no cavity.  I never felt comfortable with him and was treated like an idiot at times. Wish I would have changed sooner maybe I never had a tooth problem. He needs to spend more time with his patients and explain procedures in detail."
0,"I ordered the food to go.  Ordered chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes, got no potatoes and the gravy was horrible.  Tuna salad supposed to be white tuna, but was dark, tasted awful and extremely fishy.  The mushroom soup had zero flavor, it tasted like plain flour from too much flour to thicken.  Never have written a review before, but when everything you ordered was so bad, I felt compelled to do so."
0,"After having dined here before & given it 4 Stars, I raved it up to Norm R., Robyn N. & MIke C. who joined me for lunch here today.\n\nWell, this place was a disappointment today.  Each of us ordered the same thing, the \""Mixed Grill\"", a platter that was supposed to come with Gyros, Chicken Kabab, Kafta Kabab, rice, babaganoush, hummus, and pita bread.\n\n*  After a little while our platters showed up, missing the Gyros!     :-(\n\n*  After some back and forth, we were served the two strips each of Gyros, but it was very greasy.  We shouldn't have had to ask for it either, let alone beg!     :-(\n\n*  I tried to order a bowl of their renouned Lentil Soup, but they didn't have any.     :-(\n\n*  On top of everything else, this plate was expensive, at $12.49.     :-|\n\nUgh.  I doubt I'll be returning to this one, especially since we have excellent alternatives such as Al-Hana.     :-)"
0,"Some of the rudest, uncaring most unprofessional people i have ever seen in my life. I can't believe they call themselves professionals. My husband has severe stomach pains every day, and this hospital is the closest from our home so we usually come here. That, and they know him well from being there so often. He actually had a nurse (brandi) tell him \""why are you moving around so much, it can't hurt that bad\"" Can you believe that! And \""no one can die from pain\"" WHAT! They won't admit him because according to their standard ER tests he's in perfect health. They honestly think of him as someone who's only there to get his \""fix\"". I hear then laughing, socializing, and planning their weekends in the hallways. Meanwhile, my husband is laying there dying and screaming in pain. I wish i could give them a negative rating. DON'T COME HERE, GO ANYWHERE ELSE!\nOn the other hand, if you have a sick child, Mendys place is amazing!"
1,We love going to the square because the food quality is always great. Love the lentil soup!
0,This is a true dump! The registration staff is as close to the bottom of the barrel as it get! I am only staying here because of a stupid convention I'm attending here. This place blows!!!!!! It deserves negative stars!!!
1,I enjoy the staff here. I love Kali! Everyone is very nice and extremely helpful. My schedule is crazy but they are always willing to work around my schedule to make sure I can get in for an appointment.
1,"I loved this one. It was pretty amazing to say the least. It was very beautiful and entrancing. I would totally watch it again.\n\nI went with a friend that came to Vegas for the first time & my mom's friend got us 2 tickets to see it.\n\nBefore this I've only watched the Cirque du Soleil show with Elvis Presley and that wasn't anything spectacular as I was bored here and there.\n\nHowever, with KA, I wasn't bored and I was really into the story. It's the kind of plot where I actually enjoyed it and I wanted to know what would happen in the end. Very cute.\n\nI'm planning on seeing the other shows soon enough, but pretty sure this is one that'd top the list always."
0,"Clever catchy name and looks like it's got it going on from the outside but inside is dull and boring. This place has no ambience whatsoever. There was some music playing back in the kitchen but none for the customers. If it weren't for the fact that they have wait staff I would have thought I was dining in a cafeteria. It was quiet, not many customers at the time, so could hear conversations from tables across the room. This is where a little music could have helped. There were TVs on the walls but were not turned on. My server spoke so low (and seemed timid) that I could barely hear her and apologized a few too many times for the slow service. I only ordered the quesadilla from the starter menu so thought that would come out fairly fast but had to wait a good 25-30 minutes. Not really worth the wait either as it was very bland and didn't live up to the above-mentioned catchy name. I might go back again to try something else but not sure. Maybe take a friend or two so I don't die of boredom waiting for the food."
0,"The food at this restaurant is decent, and every time I've eaten inside it was good. However my review of the restaurant is based on my catering order with management and the catering department. \n\nI had placed an order for apx. 30 people for a rehearsal dinner for our wedding. When I originally called the manager had no idea what I was ordering from. He asked me what menu I was using and I told him the one they had advertised on their web site. He said ok, I'll figure it out. Well he did not and the food was delivered in individual plastic containers as thought I were having a business lunch. Embarrassing is an understatement. \n\nWhen I called to complain and talk to the manager I was told he was in the kitchen and too busy on Friday night to rectify the situation and rudely asked, \""what is it you want us to do?\"" . I was told the manager would call me to refund or offer me something in return for my inconvenience but I have not received any such phone call.\n\n I spent a great deal of money that night for nothing. Food was cold and tasted bad (perhaps because of the plastic containers) and my guests were inconvenienced leaving me horribly embarrassed. I will never order here again, and probably never eat inside again as a result. I can not support a place so unprofessional."
0,"This place is horrible!!! They messed up my order and when I went to complain to management. She said there was nothing she could do about my problem. Looked at me , like I was the problem. Seriously?!? What the hell are you there for than? I understand we're in the west valley but there's no reason for the lack of customer service. The pizza was also not very good. They charge for refills if you go from a coke to a sprite. Like they're not both soft drinks. I will never go to this restaurant again. Gus's gets no stars from me."
0,"Hubby, son (11 yrs old), and I went here today. We have been to a similar establishment about a mile from it a few times, but wanted to give Lin's a try. So very sorry we did. \n\nThese were our issues, not neccesarily in order: The sushi looked as though it was leftover from previous days, rice hard, vegetable pieces inside were brown. Service workers had dirty hands/fingernails. When hubby was at the grill where you get together what you would like them to grill up for you, the worker drenched the utensil (that patrons are to use to pick up raw fish) with raw fish and its water. Food was not great, not even good.\n\nWe managed to find a few items that tasted ok, but it was definitely not worth the $43 we paid. And my stomach is upset as I write this, I feel nauseated."
1,"Great food, very fresh. Nice change from fast food. The chicken kabob is awesome. Can not wait to try more menu items."
0,"Filthy! Floors, drink station, everything! Returned my sons apples that were completely brown and watched the employee rummage through many more before bringing out a new box... He handed them to me and they were expired.  Never again."
0,"The Brits have an expression, \""Smart by half.' \n\nI was driving up Scottsdale Road and noticed this new location. I have been on Which Wich's mailing list for a while and remember getting a \""Reverse Happy Hour buy one, get one free offer through August 15th\"" email .\n\nI ordered two medium turkey sandwiches, with extra meat ($3.00 up charge) and a soda.  My thinking was that one would be free and the bill would be around $10.00 or so.  Instead I was told it would be $19.16. Seems the offer reads \""order any regular size Wich and get the second Wich free\"".  Silly me.\n\nThe two mediums weighted almost two pounds each.  They felt really, really heavy.  I was impressed. But without that credit, it would have been nearly $27 for those two subs and one drink. Wow\n\nSo yesterday I thought I would try the same exercise, but with two \""Regular\"" sized sandwiches.  Without ordering a drink, my bill came to $6.41 and the two subs combined weight barely a pound.\n\nAt this point I'm giving up on comparison tests. I'll be sticking to Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mike's.  BTW, both places were empty and it took nearly ten minutes to get my order. So maybe, \""Subs, So Slow You'll Freak?\"" LOL\n\nSorry, Two Stars and  \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"""
1,My husband and I come here once a month as a treat.  I love the authentic Mexican cuisine this place offers.  Everything is fresh when it comes out from the kitchen.  We have never waited long for our food.  Great service and great prices.  You get a lot of food for what you pay for which is worth it.  The Chile Relleno is fantastic.
1,"Last month while visiting las vegas I got this craving for some deep fried food, and not the chain restaurant type. I wanted the kind you find in a ma and pop order at the counter restaurant. So I yelped fish and chips las vegas and this place popped up. After reading the mixed reviews we decided to give it a shot. We hit a winner. The cod I ordered was fried to a golden brown, moist and flaky. Shrimp was also very tasty. The French fries are fresh cut and very good. In addition to the usual dipping sauce they have a house sauce, this dipping sauce is really good. Ask for it. Joe the owner and Frank who cooked our meal to perfection are very friendly and provide great service. We will return."
0,I'm originally from the Bay Area so I used to eat pho about once or twice a week while I was up there so I have pretty high expectations for pho .. although I've rarely been to a bad pho restaurant - this one was one of my least liked. The broth is not too flavorful and it had a total of 4 pieces of brisket in it and 4 piece of the rare beef (tai) ... I gave it one extra star over 1 for the service because this is the first pho spot I have ever been to in my life where the waitress actually asked me how I was doing during my meal
1,"I was super excited when I saw they added a Potbelly to North Scottsdale. Today was my second visit. \n\nI had the Chicken and Cheddar sandwich, it's very basic. Chicken, Cheese, Bread (lettuce, tomato, pickles) but it was phenomenal. I also added a cup of vegetable soup which was surprisingly very tasty. \n\nI ordered online this time, my sandwich was ready but they still needed to scoop the soup which I appreciated. Nothing worse than cold soup."
0,"Went with three other couples on February 14th. Absolutely the worst service we as a group EVER experienced. Not only did it take 45 minutes to get a cocktail but the wait staff was both argumentative and rude. At no point did any member of the staff, including the manager, apologize. The food was inconsistent to say the least. One guest ordered a \""special cocktail\"" on your list.....you were out of the main ingredient! on Valentines Day you aren't properly stocked.......ridiculous.\n\nImportant to know, half of these 8 people have spent their careers in the restaurant industry. We were shocked that you would think you could be successful running a business in this manner."
0,"I am NOT a fan of this park.  At this point in the fall, the grass is completely dead.  It gets everywhere when you walk on it.  I am sure that the kids practicing here who fall on it are not enjoying it at all!  I am not sure why, but they are putting fences up around and through the park.  Why would you purposefully divide a park?  It makes no sense.  The only thing, and I mean ONLY thing, that I like about this park is that in putting the fencing in and making changes, they have flattened out some of the dirt lots, which make it easier for driving.  If someone asked me if they should have their sports practice times there, I would tell them that there has to be a better place out there!"
1,"Great place for breakfast lunch or a snack. \n\nService 5 stars\nBagels 6 stars\nClean 5 stars\nPrice 5 stars\n\nThat is a 5.25\n\nI get the hot pastrami on sesame seed bagel with swiss and thousand island dressing. The cheese is melted into the soft interior of the bagel while the hot pastrami and dressing combine to a wonderful flavor, topped by the chewy outer crust of the sesame studded bagel...  wheew  sorry\n\nIt comes with a drink and chips for $6.99."
0,"This place is so foul. I went with a few of my girlfriends. Side note; We all love the 1OAK in New York so what better way to spend the weekend then getting cray in Vegas. We walked in for approximately 30 minutes before we all knew what a tragic mistake we had made....\n\n1) It's in the Mirage...you know, that hotel on the strip that you've never been to because the lobby looks like a methadone clinic in the Bronx...yes, that one.\n\n2) The DJ was playing top 40...from 2009. Doesn't a prerequisite of top 40 music (as awful as it already is) require that it be the current year?\n\n3) The tables in the main room cost more than a table in New York...the main room is the only place to have a table. They tried to put us in a side room that was incredibly lame. \n\n4) The crowd is awful. The doorman treated my group of girlfriends like celebrities because of how disgusting the other women here were. Not fun to have to mingle with these sort of people. \n\n5) It's in Vegas...Vegas is disgusting. \n\nAll said and done, you can do much better if you're looking to go to a nightclub in Vegas. Try The Bank in the Bellagio if you want a venue more similar to 1OAK in New York...although even that's a stretch. Definitely NOT one of a kind."
1,"Food and service are beyond horrible, but don't skip this place because of that. The beer makes up for everything wrong. Eat at Four Peaks  and have a beer. Then go to Papago and have 2 or 3 beers. Try their orange blossom beer"
0,"If it were not for the chips and salsa, I would never return to this restaurant. I have been going there since I was a kid. In the past year or so, the service has gotten so bad, I wouldn't even believe it is the same restaurant. I only get carry out now, and that is only when I am craving the chips and salsa. \n\nEven their carry out food service is terrible, unfortunately. My past 4 visits, I have called over 30-45 minutes in advance to my order, and upon arrival nobody has prepared it. During one visit (The Friday before 2012 Superbowl), it took me 45 minutes AFTER I arrived for them to get me 2 bags of chips and 2 portions of salsa. Another woman had been waiting there longer than me. We were both waiting on chips and salsa ONLY. That should never happen.\n\nMy last visit was 3/3/12 and again, I called 35 minutes before arriving to order chips and salsa for a party. I walked in and waited 7 minutes before being greeted. The hostess then went to \""find out\"" who took my order and returned and told me I had to go to the cantina/bar to pay and get them. Once I got in there, I stood for 15 minutes trying to get the attention of someone walking by so I could get my order. Finally a man brought it to me. I was so fed up. I do not think I can return. I am sick of being treated like they don't need or even WANT my business.\n\nI have never received an apology from any of them for taking so long, and not having my order ready, even when I gave them plenty of notice AND the orders were simple."
1,"Not had a chance to write anything for a while but a visit to Heads and Tales on Friday after being too late for a gig was absolutely excellent. \n\nThey don't have a huge selection of drinks on offer, but that's what I like. They are pretty certain about what they want to give you! They're clearly proud of their drinks and that shines through. Alsop the cocktails are simple enough that they don't take 30 mins to make. Turn around time was more like 5 minutes which was amazing! \n\nOur waiter and waitress were excellent and the ambience was great.\n\nI'd like to see a greater selection of British beer in there, maybe some interesting beers from scottish brewers, and possibly even something special on keg, but the beers they did have complimented the cocktails really well so can't complain.\n\nA very enjoyable (if expensive) evening, but worth every penny. \n\n**Recommend** - the Gin and Tonic Martini - YUM. \n\n**Do not recommend** - Going out in the sun without protection. \n\n**H0ave no particular strong feelings about ** - nativity plays being replaced by more secular shows in primary schools. I sort of think that that's fine."
0,"The place is decorated nicely, the hibiscus iced tea is wonderful and the wait staff are attentive and friendly.\n\nUnfortunately, the food is overpriced, the buns are really dry, and basically it felt like a pretentious version of Blu Burger Grille."
0,"First let me state that we like Red Robin and go there a lot.  But the last few times, that is another story.\nOur last visit was about a week ago.  The service was horrible.  Food was not cooked right and everything was just confused.  It turned out the manager did comp most of the food and gave us free appetizers on our next visit to make us happy, but I think we will try another location in the future.  There were five unhappy customers. \nJanine, the server, should find a new line of work. It is rare that we do not tip 20%, but all of us agreed and left nothing."
0,"I stumbled across this quaint bookstore today, and as I was looking through a stack of books, the peaceful ambience of the store was suddenly shattered by the sound of the guy at the desk  screaming \""DON'T TOUCH THOSE BOOKS!  THOSE BOOKS AREN'T ON SHELVES!  Well then why are they stacked up here with no indication that they're off limits?  And as for shelves, why are you offering books for sale that are displayed, God forbid, on a table nearby?  This guy is lucky to have any customers (I was there for a good a half-hour and no one else came in) and yet he chooses to scream at the only one in the store?  I scampered out feeling humiliated and shamed, but I later realized that it was his behavior that was shameful.  Oh, and the books are way overpriced.  And the guy had Christmas music playing. In May?  I shall never return to this crazy, unwelcoming place as long as this scary man is inside it."
0,"I brought in the comforter from my guest room because our new puppy peed on it.  Without getting an authorization to wet clean, they washed it to get the stain out.  Stain is gone, but my guest comforter is ruined."
0,"I came here to support our friends' grand opening... But sorry. Probably never staying here again. Sbe should just stick to night life clubs. Not hotels. My room's tv didn't work, the light just kept blinking on and off on it's own, my room key randomly stopped working so I'm in line to get it working. It's a cool concept but average execution. Even the design of the hotel is pretty tacky. Disappointed to see SLS do so poorly when the one in LA is so hip and cool. I will be continuing to stay at the Wynn and Encore where I know I'm promised to get the best of Vegas. \n\nPs. How come my room is never cleaned? The cleaning staff left their clean sheet behind next to the bed. Terrible. \n\nWord of advice to SLS- train your staff, get your technical difficulties figured out before you let people stay and get rid of the hideous plaid suits you make your staff wear."
0,"While the end solution may work, the service and attention to its patients is not very good. I have been going to them for over two years and the typical wait time is over 45 minutes regardless of whether its a PA visit or a Dr. treatment/procedure. I finally walked out today after waiting 50 minutes and when they called me to ask where I was I said I left and was done with waiting. They said: \""ok, thank you.\"" The amount of patients will never get smaller as our society ages, so when they lose a patient it does not really affect their bottom line. Too bad that their service is so poor. I am looking for a new center."
0,"I can't understand how anyone can post a positive review on this place, unless they're related to the owners!! Totally overpriced, the staff check every customer out as they walk in, as they eat, as they go to the toilet and pass never ending comments on said customers in their native Tongue, and it doesn't stop there, they top it off with sniggers etc, how silly do they look. Anyway, it gets worse, the place isn't clean any more, check out the inside of the door connecting the kitchen into the small restaurant area, it's covered with black greasy grime, how don't they see this, of course, they're too busy acting the fools and making fun of their paying customers. The food and drink is totally overpriced for what is such a tasteless offering, what happened to their spices selection?!? The one thing the staff are very good at is refilling your glass of wine or beer after literally every sip, to the point that it is annoying, I thought it was only with us but the table next to us also complained about this. Anyway, in summary, we used to go but I'm afraid that it has now become a shell of it's former self, visit the place but you have been warned!"
1,"Me and my husband were on a road trip and wanted some good southern bbq.  We were not disappointed!  We had the most amazing pulled pork sandwich.  Deliciously flavored meet that tasted like it had been smoking for hours, and soft melty bread in each bite.  We tried the fried pickles which were actually good considering I do not even like pickles!  The baked beans were amazing.  The staff was friendly and didn't mind we asked to move tables, apologizing that it may take a bit longer since the server got sat two tables at the same time.  The service was actually fast and speedy.  If we lived closer we would go back, the plates looked amazing and had huge portions!  They also have different bbq sauces to eat on your food and each one was delightful. A must try!"
0,"I wasn't impressed with this place. Going to a sushi joint, you always have to be prepared to pay through the nose but here the price simply wasn't worth it. Two and a half people, lunch, $65.10 - and that wasn't including the tip. The food wasn't all that great (RA Sushi in Old Town or Tokyo Lobby in Glendale are far better), but the prices here are just nuts. $12 for a rainbow roll - really? (Tokyo Lobby have them for $10). Even the nigiris are a half buck or more over what they should be charging. $5 for two small pieces of fish and let's face it, 80% of the damn thing is plain boiled rice. They even nickel and dimed us an extra dollar just because we switched one roll to soy paper from seaweed. And a tiny cup of green tea was $2.75.\n\nDefinitely not coming back, I'm afraid. I'd rather make the trip to Tokyo Lobby (which IS the best sushi in the West Valley IMO) where the food tastes better and the prices are more reasonable. I guarantee Uni won't survive in Surprise, not with prices like this and especially not in the cattycorner location they moved into, site of at least four or five other local restaurant failures."
0,Taco bells are basically all of the same but avoid around the time high school / middle school let's out because it's full of very irritating teens- not even eating ! I'm addition to playing catch in the parking lot- ball missed my car but the teens thought it was okay to hang out sitting on mine & other peoples trunks!
0,I saw Smokey Joes Cafe last year during the summer and it was ok. I like Pease Auditorium so much better. Pease is way more intimate and I feel connected with the performance.\n\nJust my 2 cents
1,"I've lived here all of my life (33 yrs) and somehow I had never heard of this place. The exterior is unassuming, to say the least. \n\nGood food. Huge portions. Excellent service. Mostly under 8 bucks. Definitely worth going to. Don't let the structure fool you. The inside is much nicer."
1,Love this spot!!! Amazing happy hour deals and great service. Been twice in the past two days and the bartender Mitch has taken great care of me! Bloody Mary's are out of this world! I'll have to come back and try the ribeye!
0,"I had lunch with 4 friends. The service was bad; we had to call out in chorus to get the waitress's attention after she delivered the food. She never checked on the table again, or even looked our way. I ordered a cheeseburger and onion rings. She delivered french fries instead. The hamburger had gristle and unpleasant hard things in it when I bit down. Ugh."
1,This is a Great Local Florist in Carefree and in Scottsdale too. You really can trust them for quality and service. The owners are very nice and the selections are great. It smells so wonderful in their shops. Beautiful displays! Great prices too.
1,Love it but the wait is always long. Best pizza around if you don't mind waiting for it!
1,"After a long shift, its great to receive some good service. A young man named Jent was exceptionally attentive to other guests and myself, and I will surely make the trip to this location, though its not my neighborhood in n out, if it guatentees this kind of service and just a positive experience. Theres nothing like having a complicated order, and recieving no complaints. Thank you jent and the team."
1,"I have a few favorite go to pho spots, but i decided to try this because it was the closest to me. That being said i'm glad i did. I loved that you could really taste the clove in the pho, some places have started to get bland with their flavoring but this was on point. The egg rolls were as good as the ones from my favorite spot too. Our waitress was really cool and my son asked if we could start coming to this one so enough said. The only reason i gave it 4 stars was because i'm use to the cheaper prices at my spot and bigger bowls but don't let that stop you from coming the FOOD IS GREAT and worth it! we'll be back!"
0,"After hearing for years that this is Theeee Best Breakfast in town I finally checked it out.  Now I've been twice, and I just don't get it.  I just found NOTHING special about this place at all.  It's a cute breakfast dinner and the pancakes and waffles are ... well, pancakes and waffles.\n\nBoth times I've been we had to wait to be seated, and both times I didn't feel it was worth it.\n\nIn my opinion Palette, Over Easy and Matt's Big Breakfast are so much better.  Of course your mileage may vary."
1,Just a wonderful and delicious experience. Falafel and palakari will blow your mind. Will be back soon!!
1,Great great great make your own burger place. Need I say more. It's a great place to stop & have lunch while in Vegas. If you have a small appetite share a burger with someone & order an order of fries with salad to share.
1,Pretty darn good and our service was great.  I had the Bacon Cheeseburger and my wife had the chicken sandwich.   Review would have been 5 stars but 2 beers are $19!!!!!.  Total ripoff......but you are at the airport so think of what is reasonable and double it.
0,"Been here twice. The first time was great because the 6 of us were the only customers in there at the time. Went back today and found they were hosting two birthday parties at the same time. Waited over 20 minutes just to get noticed while standing at the counter. Then, I was told it would be at least another 30 minutes until they could get us in a race. Do not waste your time here if they are hosting any birthday parties. They only staff this place with a couple of people. There is nothing to do while you wait except play a few video games and drink from vending machines. If you pull up and there are more than 10 cars in the parking lot, don't even bother unless you want to kill several hours.\n\nYou would think for the $20-$25 you pay per race, these guys could pay a few more minimum wage kids to help out. Especially on the weekends! The main issue is the time it takes to go through their registration\\check-in process. Then, by the time they get you to watch the safety video and put helmets on all the racers it takes them about 20-30 minutes per group.\n\nThe plus side is the place is clean. The track and cars are fun to race. It is indoor so you don't have to worry about hot or cold days."
0,"5 stars last year? What a difference a year makes! This year's experience, pardon my language, sucked donkey balls. Let's break down the formula for the San Gennaro Feast, circa 2012 edition. \n\n1: Parking. Fleece your customers to park sort of close or fleece them a little less and make them walk halfway across the west side of Vegas to get a parking space. \n1a: Find the surliest, most hateful parking attendants in Vegas. Hire them based on attitude. \n2: Find the most disorganized and slow way of getting people to the gate to pay admission. Did the ice sheet in Antarctica melt by the time it took us to get in? \n3: Once inside run past the pushy merchants trying to sell you everything. \n4: Pay out the nose for food. No let's take an arm and a leg too. \n5: Offer a super tiny itsy bitsy teeny weenie little place to sit and eat your overpriced food. (Think Strip prices but on the wrong side of I-15). Oh wait, we don't want you to sit, that would take up too much space we need for maximum monetization of the event!\n6: Let's charge way too much for carnival ride tickets. \n7: Let your friends cut in front of everyone that waited 20 min for a ride. (Happened 4x)\n8:Fight hordes of rude, stupid people who must have been born in a barn and don't have a freakin clue about basic courtesy.\n9: Walk back to your car that was supposedly watched by \""security\"" to find your mirror broken off and dangling and other damage done to your car. \n\nLas Vegas deserves a San Gennaro Feast that is in the Italian traditions, not the Mafia traditions. I felt like I got fleeced, mugged, and downright abused at this year's event. \n\nSomeone needs to step back and rethink what the heck they're doing here. This could be a world class event but the way it's going, this will be the last year I go back. \n\n1 Star, posted under extreme howling protest. Eek! Methinks not, indeed!"
0,"My opinion is skewed by my love of the Sourdough Cafe at the ACD on Decatur.  Compared to the other Sourdough Cafe, this place seemed rather sterile with no counter seating option, no character or characters.  The service was minimal and the food edible.  You get what you pay for.  Makes me miss living closer to the other Arizona Charlies (on Decatur).  The Casino is a lot nicer, but this Sourdough Cafe just can't compare to the other."
1,"Overall this was a very pleasant stay. Nothing outrageously luxurious or horribly bad. We stayed here for 2 nights for a wedding of a family member. \n\nPros: \n- When we first checked in it was about 12 at night. The desk attendant was very friendly and accommodating, a GREAT 1st impression\n- We wanted a quiet place, away from the strip to go home to and this was perfect. The giant king bed was comfortable and had lots of pillows. The layout of the room was different and refreshing.\n- Breakfast was above average than your usual continental breakfast you get. They provided orange juice, coffee, milk, lemon water, fresh waffles, bagels, cereal and yogurt  \n- Free WIFI\n- Did I mention that they have coffee 24/6 \n- About 4 minutes away there is a 24 hour supermarket...\n\nCons: (just a few)\n- The door to our bathroom did not shut properly (a broken spring that can be easily fixed)\n- We were in a room near the end of the hall. The door to the stairs slammed when it was shut. Luckily only a few times. \n\nOverall a very pleasant stay! If all La Quintas are like this I will be back  :)"
1,"I broke a key in the door lock of a metal security door and my front door was rendered useless.  I called and Steve came out within hours.  While he was here I also had him fix another lock that was sticking.  His work was quick, efficient, and effective.  His prices were as quoted and very reasonable.  It is refreshing to have an honest professional who is quick and good at his job.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
0,"Rude workers and barely any toppings on my burgers ever! I go shopping and want a quick burger fix but every time I come to this location it's the same thing. Idk why I keep coming back! Geeze on me! I even debate on del taco but noooo I choose Wendy's and the same thing every time! Take my $20 and screw me over! Smashed burgers, no toppings and practically throw my food at me! How rude! And when I ask for salt every time I get rolling eyes! Shame on you!"
0,"Had high hopes, but we were very disappointed in Blue Hound.\n\nMy husband treated me to VIP tickets for Train at Comerica so I treated him to dinner prior to the show....so wanted this place to be great.\n\nOur creds: late 30's executives...DINK's so we enjoy fine dining often. Favorite Gastro-pub in Valley: Citizen Public House Scottsdale...also love Cowboy Caio in Scottsdale.\n\nPros:\n- walking distance to downtown venues\n- industrial chic decor\n- best cocktail menu I have ever seen\n\nCons:\n- Ironically, the food. Appetizers: pork bellies and cheddar biscuit apps. Pork bellies...we KNOW pork bellies...all over foodie menus across town...these were like rubber bacon. If you want fantastic pork bellies, go to Citizen Public House or Arrogant Butcher. Cheddar biscuits were good but nothing interesting. Dinner: husband had pork neck..it was nice looking but very ordinary and bland. I had Fried Quail...it was yummy...tasted exactly like KFC...came with cold corn bread, cold gravy and precisely 5 cold beans...could not taste the foie gras in the cornbread. Husband asked for bread to have with his pork neck soup...server said they didn't have bread but he would ask the kitchen...he came back with 2 tiny crostinis in a soup bowl...dry, tasteless, odd.\n\n- The service. Hostess (on 9/30 at 5pm) tried to seat us in an almost empty dining room at the one table right next to the table bussing station. REALLY? We asked for another table and she said we can't have any other table because she had to save those for groups of 4...completely understood so we took a table in a far corner. 5 minutes later she sat a couple at the 4-up...she was also unfriendly and didn't seem to want to be there. Our server was blah and wasn't at all passionate about the menu options...Servers at Arrogant Butcher are awesome!\n\nIn closing...if you want a fantastic foodie meal in downtown, go to Arrogant Butcher...if you are in Scottsdale, go to Citizen Public House..ENJOY!"
1,"Excellent meal, great environment. Will definately be going back."
1,"It is a pleasure working with a truly talented professional.   I knew in the first 30 minutes that I had met someone who could help me through profound professional and personal transitions and help me grow emotionally.\n\nI am far from fixed, but have come a long way in a short period of time with Jen.  Issues that brought me nothing but anxiety, anger and overall negativity are now viewed with cautious optimism.  I am kinder to those around me and kinder to myself.\n\nJen's directness is surgical but leaves no scars:)  \n\nI am grateful that I found Jen on yelp."
1,"If Hello Kitty opened up a cupcakery in Charlotte, it'd probably look a lot like this one. Very bright, clean and inviting - enough that I was willing to get out of the car during the pouring rain in search of cakey goodness.\n\nThere's a wide range of self-serve yogurt flavors lining the back wall, though I didn't see any sampler cup-lets sitting out as other similar places offer. Maybe you have to ask for them?\n\nOther posters have mentioned the need to get here early so that you don't miss out on the good flavors, but I showed up around 6pm after work and saw everything still seemed to be available. Granted, it was only a Tuesday...\n\nSo, down to the nuts and bolts. There were about 10 cupcakes on display. Each is $2.99 (plus tax), which fairly pretty in-line with expected pricing. I asked the girl at the counter several questions about the various flavors and ingredients, and was happy to learn that they only use butter - no shortening. Hooray!\n\nSeveral options piqued my interest, but I took away a Key Lime for Husband, and a Chocolate Cream for myself. The two fist-sized cupcakes were packed into an adorable little box with cut-out holders inside so they don't tip over during transport. With such cute packaging, these would make a great little gift to brighten someone's day or bring to a dinner party! I can only imagine they have similar materials for one/four/more-packs.\n\nWhen I got home, I was able to sample the wares. Although Husband hasn't eaten his yet, I \""accidentally\"" swiped a bit of the frosting off the side, and it was really nice - light, fluffy, creamy, with a hint of key lime flavor (though I can't fully be sure that the flavor was deliberately infused in the frosting, or if it just crept up from the cake). (ETA: Husband said it was vanilla cake with key lime frosting. Also, that it was yummy. Husband does not dedicate quite as much verbiage to food reviews as I do.)\n\nBe forewarned that these are HEFTY as far as cupcakes go. As I mentioned above, each was about the size of a fist, and was weighty for its size - not something you'd just pop into a lunchbox. This is a dessert you have to commit to! The portion of cake is large, and the frosting a sizable mound on top of it. My chocolate cake was good - both light and moist with a good chocolate flavor. It's not a deep, dark, dense chocolate (my personal preference), but instead is a solid base that would appeal to many.  There was a tiny dollop of white buttercream in the center, and a bit more capping the mountain of fudge frosting that sat on top. Think: Hostess on steroids. The fudge frosting was enjoyable, creamy and thicker than the buttercream, but I didn't care for it quite as much as I liked the buttercream, and it was a little too sweet and there was a little too much of it all around. By the end, I ended up scraping about half off to feed the Garbage Monster.\n\nOverall, I had a really nice first impression and would be eager to try other cake flavors, plus sample some of the yogurt. The Stuffed French Toast (vanilla cupcake with cream cheese icing in the center and topped with maple cinnamon buttercream, I think) looked tempting, as did the Birthday Cake yogurt. As a chain, they haven't displaced my love for local cupcake businesses, and the size is a bit overwhelming for it to be more than a very occasional treat, but I'm glad the option is there. It actually might be kind of dangerous that they're so close to where I live, and that they keep such long hours..."
0,"If you enjoy paying too much for extremely mediocre pizza,  then this is the place to be. Each 'za is 11 inches and costs between $13 - $17 per pizza. We got the mahgerita and the Quattro pizzas and both were very bland. We come to Vegas quite a bit,  but we will never be back to Flour and Barley."
0,"i came here to eat a few times since the review and a lot of my friends told me that this place was good.  First I tried the hawaiian side which was not bad, but it wasn't great.  The Food I must say lacked flavor.  I ate the Mochiko Chicken and the Beef stew and they could use more flavor in the dishes.  It was pretty bland. \n\nA few days later I decided to try the Sushi side and again it wasn't great but not bad.  the Rice was overcooked and they did not use enough sugar in their sushi rice vinegar which made it a little bitter.  and anyone who is a lover of great sushi knows the rice is the most important ingredient to sushi not the fish.  oh by the way the salmon was really bland.  \n\nI decided to take home some baked goods home so I can eat it after at home..  I got some Malasadas, a custard pie and guava cake..\nI took it home and decided that i couldn't wait and ate them immidiately.  i'm sorry but the malasadas was hard as a rock.  Not fluffy at all.  The custard pie was good except the crust was too salty.  and the cake was good also but the cake part was very dry.  \n\nIt seems that they do not have any quality check going on at this restaurant.  or they just don't care."
0,"The good was TERRIBLE! In addition to that the service was even WORSE! No ice, the food was not cooked properly as well as it took forever for anything to finally make it to our table! We will never return to this particular place AGAIN!"
1,"Not closed and impressive. From what I could tell Tableau is open for Breakfast and Lunch only. The balcony sits adjacent to one of several of Wynn's pools and on a warm late spring morning was a great place to enjoy breakfast. The service was outstanding and incredibly attentive. Expected but always nice when it is delivered. Classic breakfast menu with eggs, waffles, pancakes, hash, potatoes etc..... All however with a little love and a twist. I had the Blueberry, Ricotta pancakes with a chicken apple sausage and my dining partner the strawberry waffles with a side of the potato hash. All were cooked to perfection and to our enjoyment. I think the only annoyance was a slight attitude at my request for a pot of green tea with a glass of ice. I like fresh iced tea and they didn't offer green, which in today's day of healthy eating still surprises me that so many places do not. \n\nWill gladly bring other clients and friends back on my next trip."
1,"I really liked the experience I had at Marcellino's on Friday night.  They had opera singers from the Phoenix Symphony performing which were very good.  I enjoyed my handmade ravioli with spinach and yummy cheese (not fish yay!) filling and the wine and the mouse.  It was good!! \n\nBut then something happened....my date gave the server his card to pay for the meal and it was brought back as not able to be processed (yikes!).  The server also informed him that they'd been able to process someone else's but one other didn't go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasn't just his it was everyone's! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasn't cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt.\n\nThen, the next day, he checked his account and he'd been charged twice!! :( sad, because I thought I might like to go back at some point."
1,"Fantastic burgers!  Love the variety.  One of the guys working behind the bar told us to put one of our fried pickles on our burger, and that was the best advice I had heard during the entire trip to Vegas.  It's the simple things in life."
0,"The Stratosphere has three rides they offer and during my visit only two were open. One has the built of a roller coaster and shoots you off the building (really lame and short). The second ride is 10 better. A crane like hand, hangs you over the side of the building and spins you.  \n\nI imagine kids would love them but I wouldn't recommend them to any adrenaline junkie. \n\n$12 per ride."
0,"Vegas doesn't have many good breakfast spots (at least not like LA or SF) so when 2 of my friends went here and said I should try it- I hoped it could be my new fav spot for a morning meal. It is in my neighborhood- so worth a try.\n\nWe went on a Sat morning, 2 people.\n\nAtmosphere- \nI am not sure why it is so bright in here (like hospital waiting room bright) and the 4  VERY LARGE screen tvs are a little tacky and disruptive (you catch them out of your eye- look at them, and the waitress or next table thinks you are looking at them)- but I am here for the food and there is no accounting for taste- shrug. The place appears clean at least.\n\nService-\nWe were seated promptly, drinks ordered (twice) and food came out correctly and without incident.\nIt was only after we had our food that our server asked once if things were ok and then we didn't see her again for almost 30 minutes. I wanted to ask her why my non-fat cappucino made by their \""barista\"" was actualy a full fat latte, but by the time she came back to see if we were done and needed a box/check- it was too late to bother. Plenty of other waitresses around- no one stopped by to check in (which is what I was taught to do if another waitress is on break). Just because someone isn't \""your\"" table- they are still patrons of the establishment and could be your table if they come back).\n\nFood-\nNothing to write home about. eggs benedict was decent and omelet wasn't too rubbery. Hash browns tasted frozen, but were edible. \nWe asked specifically about the coffee to make sure their espresso machine wasn't a \""pod\"" type (see my Chianti Cafe review) and were assured coffee was their speciality and no one ever complains about it because they have a barista! The barista looks about 12 years old- and maybe I would have been the first to complain- but for anyone who knows/cares- a latte is completely different than a cappucino. I can live with the fat vs. non fat mistake- but I don't like milky coffee- which is what I got for my $3.75. Blech\n\nPrices-\nA little high, $10 each and another $3.75 for a mocha and cappucino- but in line with the other places I have been to.\n\nI would go back- but only to grab a pastry and try to get a real coffee in the front- which isn't as bright and has a *little* more sophistication than the back with all the TVs. I don't need to be distracted from the food, thanks.\n\nFailing that- I wouldn't bother. I'll cook at home or wait to see if someone else tries to bring LV a good morning spot someday."
1,"A bit unfair to all the other microbrews in town, but obviously Peaks has been a staple in the Tempe area for decades for good reason. All the beer is brewed on site which means everything is fresh -- they actually use the same water they serve at the tables in the brewing process, to give you an idea how pure the finished product is. \n\nNo matter if you're there to eat or knock a few back Peaks is a must. You can't go wrong with virtually anything on the menu but anyone happening upon Peaks for the first time should absolutely order an entree or side of the fries, an undisputed favorite. I usually go with anything involving blackened chicken, be it salad or nachos.\n\nThe sampler trey is offered at a reasonable price and provides about 4 oz servings of each of the beers listed on the big board. If you're looking for something lighter I would suggest the Sunbru or Peach -- my personal favorite is doing a half & half of Oatmeal Stout with Peach. Get inventive.\n\nThe staff is used to working with a lot of traffic so I've never had bad service there -- these guys really know their stuff!"
0,I tried to dine here at 11:15 on Tuesday but they weren't open yet even though the hours posted claimed they opened at 11:00 am.
0,Dr. Westfield was a great counselor when she showed up. After 4 times of being a no show I said goodbye. How unproffessional not to show up because something happens ever heard of a phone call? My time is valuable and not to be wasted.
1,"The newest grocery store to add to a long list of options in Ahwatukee. \nWhy would you visit Sprouts?  The fruits and veggies are better priced then anyone around hands down, their a LOCALLY owned business and it's a great option if your not a fan of the oversized grocery stores.\n\nThey have all the healthier options that we need these days and very few of the overly processed foods we should avoid.  The other day I was at a competitor and couldn't find a single low fat plain greek yogurt although they had 1500 options of Yoplait.  \nI love that although there are fewer options at Sprouts, they have what I'm looking for.  More doesn't always mean better.\n\nThis new store has all the bins you could need, a great coffee selection with free samples of the daily brew and some inexpensive yummy baked goods.\n\nThanks Sprouts for coming to my neighborhood!"
0,"Were my fried chicken sliders microwaved? I am suspicious. \n\nIt was really wet (I don't want to use the word juicy) in the middle and insanely hot. The taste was just marginal. Nothing to write home about.\n\nOne good thing though is the draft list. They have a large selection. \n\nWe went for lunch, but thought of going the previous evening and it was just so loud that we turned right around."
0,"I sincerely wish I could write a 5 star review for E2 but I just can't. Which is unfortunate since it is the perfect location for a visit to the museums or Knight Theater. Last Friday there was a big crowd due to crawfish night and the volume level was really loud. Not so much because of the crowd but I think largely because of the acoustics. \nWe started with the kale Caesar salad. This is a good idea but because kale if pretty firm, it would have been better with some other green mixed in. Also the pieces of kale were not bite sized. We also ordered the grouper with black rice and mussels. The fish was seasoned nicely and cooked perfectly but I felt the rice was a bit overcooked. The mussels had an off-taste - didn't finish them!\nEveryone we encountered was pleasant and friendly. However, their \""tag team\"" service style caused some disconnect here and there. As in, one server not knowing what the other server had done. In general the service was slow and the bar service was really slow.\nThis is my 3rd or 4th visit and I'll probably find other places next time."
0,"We came during 4th of July weekend because a friend found a promoter who said guys could get in for $10 and girls would be free if we came by 10:30pm.  The promoter also promised the girls a Full Open Bar until 11:30pm, which was another huge incentive for us to come.\n\nRight before we headed over there, the promoter apparently changed his mind and said that guys had to pay $30.  What the... not cool.  We hoped the free drinks would offset the cost, so we went anyway.  The Full Bar only consisted of basic drinks like vodka/tonic, rum/coke, redbull/vodka but nothing too fancy.  Oh well, it was good enough.\n\nThe dance floor is TINY, but we still had a lot of fun here!  Much more fun than we had at Tao.  We enjoyed the Deejay and the music he played.  Good times."
0,"We stopped by last night to check out the McRib so this review is for that. I can honestly say that the McRib is McGross. The sauce cloyingly sweet, the meat had the texture of a sponge and after a couple bites I threw it out. Im not quite sure that the big deal is about with this sandwich. I do remember having one as a kid but like Twinkies somethings just taste better when you're young. \n\nThe staff here was really friendly and while the sandwich was gross, it was served hot and fresh."
0,"Typically, I give places 2 stars b'c it wasn't good.  My idea of rating is 3 and up is acceptable.  In this case, I just couldn't get myself to give this establishment 3 stars even though there wasn't anything wrong about it.  However, it was exactly as Yelp has helped us with the ratings: \""Meh.  I've experienced better.\""\n\nI got the eggplant parm and it was OK.  the eggplant itself was good but it tasted like it was fried in \""old oil\"" if you know what I mean.  If it was fresh oil, I bet it would've been better.\n\nThe mash potato that came with it was pretty decent actually would probably give that 3 stars.\n\nThe husband had their french dipped sandwich.  Again, he was like, \""it was OK\"".  Our one  year old had the quesadilla and it was ok, too ... but we've had better\n\nThe ambience hasn't changed much since it used to be McGrath's.  The service was decent.  Our waitress was very nice to our party of 6 plus a 1 year old."
1,"I never thought to go in here because of the Ross in the same shopping center, but I decided to yesterday for the heck of it and it was totally worth it.\n\nIt has always seemed to me that the items at Marshalls were pricier than Ross and they are, but for good reason. The store has a better selection of clothing and all the racks were so packed. Their \""clearance\"" section didn't seem like clearance at all (due to the price), but nice clothing nonetheless. The \""CUBE\"" section is the juniors clothing.\n\nThe dressing rooms are sooo nice, much like one that you would find in a nice boutique. There were two hanging hooks in there, one marked \""definitely\"" and the other \""tomorrow\"". Cute, right?\n\nI'm coming back!"
1,"Okay so this is another place that I would have never walked into but so glad I did. My sisters live close and took me once and now I have to stop by every time I am out that way. \n\nThere always seems to be a little bit of a wait, usually around 20 minutes, but definitely worth it. Once you are seated they serve you pretty quickly. This place is small and it's always packed. Their food is the best! They bring you chips and different salsas to start. If you aren't afraid of spicy food ask them for the avocado salsa; its a green salsa that is usually made super hot but can be tamed when mixed with their other salsas. Their chips are always hot and taste fresh like their dishes. I usually get anything with Carne Asada because they make it better than anywhere else. \n\nI wish they had a full bar because a good mojito would make this place perfect :)!"
1,"Wow! out of the 5 reviews I see on here, only one is from a local!\n\nSo now I will make it 2 local reviews. It's amazing how we take the little things for granted. You know, like gas stations and grocery stores. That's what makes Smith's special. 24 hour convenience! You never know when you might need milk or eggs or gas or medicine etc, at 2 in the morning. \n\nSince I live here, I didnt realize how many times I go here for not just the common things, but also for some of the oddest random things. Like one time my wife was craving pepperjack cheese at 2 in the morning and no she was not pregnant. In most cases, I not only get what is needed, but I also tend to get things that look very appealing, especially when it's on sale. Like namebrand cereals. Sometimes they have them 2 for 5 bucks. Hay, who doesnt like Coco Pebbles, Captain Crunch and Frosted Flakes? Regular prices are usually 4 bucks a pop! So when I see it on sale I stock up!\n\nOf course to get the discounts you gotta get a Smith's card! It's easy to apply cuz it only takes a couple minutes. You not only save money but all the money you spend equals points towards discounts when you gas up at the Smith's gas station adjacent to the store and yes its 24 hours as well. With gas prices the way they are, it's comforting to know that you can get discounts off of gas just by doing what you normally do by shopping.\n\nA special shout out goes out to the people that work here especially the swing and grave shifts. Most people dont want to be shopping for things at 2 in the morning let alone working all night! \n\nSo overall, I appreciate you my dear Smith's. I am proud to call you my store cuz you are always there for me 24/7 and I mean that literally!"
0,"Are you a pretentious twit who is desperate to fit in with the Yah crowd at Edinburgh uni? Then Jack Wills is for you! \n\nWhat a ridiculous shop. You really make an arse out of yourself by spending 70 pounds on a hoody declaring you are part of the Rowing team at Cambridge. I think it's time to reexamine your life if this seems like a good idea. \n\nThe staff are just as ridiculous. The girls obviously jam their fingers into electricity sockets before they leave the house in order to achieve such big, hideous hair. \n\nWhen did wearing tracky bottoms and looking like you have just rolled out of bed become fashionable? \n\nPrats."
0,"Simply stated, not worth it by Vegas standards.\nMy wife bought a groupon for 2 for $46.\n\nThe good:\nWe were seated rather quickly.  The service was pretty good.  Our table server was attentive and filled our waters and drinks pretty quickly.  \n\nThe bad\nThe restaurant was not exceptionally clean.  There were a number of tables that had not been cleaned and were waiting to be bussed.\nThe restaurant has a strange layout.  The food is spread over a rather large area and broke into sections.  It gives a rather odd sense of not really knowing completely what is available.\n\nThe disappointing\nThe food quality overall is just average at best.  There were a few things that were pretty good, however generally this buffet is similar to any international buffet in my hometown that you could go to for $15 or $20.  The crab legs were cold and clearly a smaller size than some of the other buffets in Vegas.  The sushi is terrible.  There was an abundance of low cost pasta dishes etc that fill you up, but are not very distinguishable etc.\n\nUltimately, my meal wasn't awful, however I wouldn't return.  I only get the opportunity to go to Vegas once in a while, during my limited time there I rather go to one of the premier buffets.  Clearly, those buffets are more expensive, however I left feeling disappointed that I didn't take the opportunity to eat at a nicer place.  \n\nThis place would be ideal for broke college students trying to fill their stomachs as inexpensive as possible with cheap food and all you can drink."
0,"Usually my husband and I love this place. But we notice each time we arrive around 2 they are willing to seat us. Despite they close at 3. \n-My husband has a very sensitive stomach so we will be there for the remaining hour. Our last visits they without warning put all the chairs up to I suppose remind people they are closing since they fail to verbally communicate. So our breakfast looks like the image I will be posting. We pay and tip (well) like everyone else, but just so happens we end up looking at chairs and all of their dusty glory. A friendly reminder would be much appreciated. But to leave your customers wondering in silence leaves a bitter taste. We were definitely disappointed. :/"
0,Been going here for almost 2 years.  Food is the same but now there's a $5.50 service charge for two all you can eat meals. Waitress said it was a 15% service charge/automatic tip. The actual percentage is just over 17% and it was strange that it was just hand written on the check and then entered in as a tip on the credit card charge. So the large advertisements for a 15.95 meal aren't that accurate.
0,"One hot day this week,  I was searching for a decent iced tea in Fashion Show Mall. I stumbled upon Teavana and was happy to find a little tea boutique in Vegas (even if it is a chain) because I've been searching for one that could come close to the quality of Tealuxe in Boston. The thrill was soon over, however, when a salesperson practically pushed me around the store, shoving hot tea samples in my face, and trying to get me to buy a $100 teapot and a special tea that turns into a flower (here's your cue to go, \""ooooooh\""). Several times I blurted out, \""Can't I just buy an iced tea?\"" If I'd known where the nearest Starbucks was, I would have left the store.   \n\nWhen I got to the counter and sampled a delicious iced tea, I decided to go ahead and buy half a bag of loose leaf in addition to my beverage (yes, I was suckered in by their free sample technique - they got me there). Although I explicitly told him I just wanted a small bag of tea, the sales guy repeatedly tried to upsell me again on storage tins. He was repeatedly rude, challenging me about the quality of my tins at home because \""tupperware and glass just won't work\"" - seriously, this was a ridiculous conversation to be having. \n\nWhen I finally convinced him I just wanted a bag, and I saw their scoop size, I said that one scoop of tea would be plenty. A nosy saleswoman nearby said that they couldn't sell less than two scoops of tea. WHAT? I'm mad at myself that I didn't walk out then and there, but my drink was being made and I'm not a dine and dash kind of gal. The bottom line: they've earned 2 stars in my book because their tea is pretty tasty, but their service is pushy and rude, and I won't be returning to this store."
0,"Be Forewarned - HORRIBLE Experience.\n\nThe words CUPCAKE and HORRIBLE should never have to be connected in the same thought IMHO.  \n\nBought a GROUPON and was excited to get gourmet cupcakes at a decent price.  After MONTHS of leaving messages and trying to actually use the Groupon, nothing.  What kind of business owner won't return calls for business?  \n\nI had been a customer prior to the Groupon. Their cupcakes are drier and not nearly as good as Sprinkles or others in the valley, but were closer to where I am.  With this horrible customer service, Cupcakes has now lost my business for good."
0,"I can see their goal to put some Chinese elements into theater art. However, the customs really need to rework and the script and the entire choreography need some serious work as well. They literally wasted all the performers' talents and it is a pity."
1,The only thing I regret about eating here is that I should have spoken Thai and maybe I could have got better service because when you are new you want to at least get directed on  how to enjoy your meal here but I guess not..they were brief and didn't really care about customers enjoying their meal here..I will give them another shot because we basically watched other people eat here and we had to figure it out on our own and now know what to do..our maybe I'll bring my parents with me to show us how
0,"Looked at yelp and wanted to try it today but it is closed, forever apparently."
1,"The food was excellent.  The mac and cheese with lobster, the lobster was plentiful and big chunks.  The New York was juicy and the Sea Bass was divine.  The Ginger Peach drink was refreshing :)  Travis, our server, was very personable.  Definitely recommend and will go back."
1,What a little hidden gem! Summer days in Vegas makes me scream for ice cream !! I tried the banana toffee crunch and the pistachio- 5/5 stars! Two scoops for $6 but they give u huge scoops so its good to share or for your own if you don't feel like sharing. They have cafe foods to go to satisfy your hunger if you're on the go. Dont leave this place without ordering The Ahi tuna salad and it is AMAZING. Now I know I gotta make a stop here every time I'm in town :)
1,"A buddy and I went in the other night for the first time and it was a nice change from pub food in the area.  The location is a little random and I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the place is still looking for an identity  Bar vs Restaurant.  With that being said my buddy got the steak and it was good.  I got one of their flat bread pizzas and it was good size and quality.  I forget the name but it had chicken, artichokes and spinach.  We sat in the high top section where the bartender was working out tables and serving the bar, he did a great job.  Happy Hour had 2$ off appetizers.  The place died down a lot after Happy Hour but I hope this place stays open."
0,"They have a lot to learn.  We opted to try this new burger place but will never know how the food is. Talk about slow that is an understatement.  It was so slow we never did receive our food.  After waiting an hour after our order was taken we walked out.  Now I heard excuses before but to say your food takes longer because it is so fresh holy cow!  Because you must have been slaughtering the cow onsite and grinding the meat.  Next time check on your customers more often, then offer the truth when you realize you screwed up.  Don't send a manager after the customer asked about their food 20 minutes ago and tables around them that received their orders before yours when yours was placed a good 15 minutes before.  Amazing Smashburger down the street had our fresh cooked burgers to us in 8 minutes.  A lot to learn."
1,"XS is the reason I can never be content going to any other clubs. Beautiful venue, gorgeous people, and the DJ keeps you dancing all night long.... even if you're wearing uncomfortable 4 inch stripper heels... and i've never had to pay cover to get in. :) Chicks, avoid holidays and long weekends if you are not willing to front a cover charge here.\n\nI love the pool and cabana area... it feels so good dipping your bare feet in the pool after a long night of dancing. \n\nI always know I'll have a good time when I step into XS... a few months back, a guy started making it rain right where my girlfriends and I were dancing... that's a bit XSive if you ask me!"
1,This place is pretty decent if you want to just hang out in a relaxed atmosphere.  I don't know why the previous reviewers dislike the clientele so much because I've never really had a problem in here and everyone is super nice.  The nachos are definitely excellent so try those.  It's not going to be the same experience as going to a P.T.'s or Timbers but if you want something a little less corparate as far as hole in he wall bars go then try this place.
0,"LV Cabs is the reason why we should be able to give Negative stars. I've never been on the phone with so many people who were awful at what they do. It's like, if you hate what you do for a living, then please (for the sake of people who have places to go) work somewhere else!\n\nAnd what's with the perpetual state of \""Well we don't have any cars anywhere on planet earth\""? On a Monday morning at 2:30am, there were apparently no cabs on planet earth that were capable of coming to W. Lake Mead & Buffalo (for 2 hours) (After I was told that a cab was on the way, so they're also liars). The previous review was spot-on.\n\nI pride myself on being the best at what I do for a living, it's nice to see that there are still companies out there like LV Cabs who embrace being the very worst in the world at what they do.\n\n\nFinal Verdict: LV Cabs HATES locals, you're better off walking; -4 Stars"
0,"We called a cab 45 min in advance of a pick up and they never came. We waited an extra 15 min and when I called the first time they said someone was on their way. The second time they said said it could be anywhere from another 30 min to an hour. If you're on a schedule like we were, don't call them."

1,"It is good to see Surprise get a good taco shop.  Not to say Riva's is bad because it is not.  I am just happy to see one closer to our house.\n\nLet me start this to say that this location is VERY clean.  Even the bathrooms!  For a Berto's style taco sop that is saying a lot!  \n\nVery friendly service and helpful staff.\n\nI have been ordering this style food my entire life, so I have my favorites.\n\nRolled Tacos- Crispy and fresh with a good amount of guacamole and cheese.  The tacos have a good amount of meat inside.\n\nCarne Asada Burrito- Not salty meat!  Not fatty skirty steak!  Two biggest things i look for in a carne asada burrito!  Nice amount of Pico and guacamole.\n\nMachaca Burrito- Yum!  I like my machaca without the tomatoes and they are always wiling to oblige.  Nice egg to shredded beef ratio!\n\nBean Burrito- Not too runny!  a good standy by.  I usually ask for a bean and rice burrito so it does not all fall apart.\n\nBeef Burrito (Ground Beef)- Very good ground beef.  Full of flavor and nice touch of onions and peppers.\n\nCheese Quesadilla- My two boys are fans!\n\nI am also a fan of their salsa bar.  They keep it clean, cool and covered!\n\nThank you Federico's!  You are a welcome addition to Surprise!"
1,It is the best restaurant that I have ever eaten at!They have the best house salad! The service was excellent! The waitress was so friendly and helpful .They have the best soup I have ever tasted!had a  great time!

0,"Horrible, horrible service!!! Came here on  a Sunday afternoon on my birthday weekend and sat outside which was not overflowing with people in our section.  We were in a party of about 8 so gratuity was already going to be included. Well, they must of took the fact that they were already getting a good tip to give us horrible service. First of, our waiter took forever to get to us. We ordered food and drinks our waters and regular drinks took about 13 minutes to come out the beers took about 20 mins to come out. Our food  took about 45 minutes.  Our group had two orders of wings once they came out with food the wings were dead cold.  We had no water refills for the longest time. We told our waiter about the wings and he took them back. Then another server lady came by and asked us how everything was we told her we didn't have any silverware nor napkins she came by brought us the silverware she also told us she spoke to the manager and the wings would be comped.  \n\nWell, I had to ask for water with the girl since we had not seen our original waiter since our food came out. We received our bill and the wings were still included on the bill. When we asked our second waiteress she said \""she thought they were gonna be comped but they are not\"". Well, we are not paying and we didn't wr told her and she said she would talk to the manager. She came back and told us they were taken off the bill and they were. \n\nSo was two good burgers entrees worth $50 dollars, Nope!"
1,"We were here on Tues. March 5, 2013 a party of six, with reservations. We all enjoyed the ambience, food, wine and service. Everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed the appetizers of mussels and then their entree.  Not one of us had room for dessert .  The service was friendly and professional with a fresh basket of bread and butter delivered to our table before it was needed. Would highly recommend dining here to anyone and will dine here again when back in Tempe, Az."
0,"Second bad experience in a row. What was consistent was the service. It was bad. And this time, so was the food. Of four entree orders, three were messed up to some degree and they didn't arrive at the same time. \n\nToo bad."
1,"I always have a soft spot for a good burger and this place delivers.  Best Bloody Mary ..well if I remember right..haha.\nIt has been a while since visiting this Fav place for a local.  But, I like choosing my own combo to make a perfect burger. \nI have been there about 3-4 times and can be A bit crowded, but good indication the food is worth it.\nCheers..get the Bloody Mary. :0P"
0,"Very disappointing!  You may get a good rate but beware of all the hidden fees.  If you want to check in before 4, that will cost you 15.00 plus tax! When you get to the room, be prepared to pay for your coffee: $8.00 for three cups.  They have keurig machines so you can avoid this fee by bringing your own coffee.  There is no free wi-fi...that will cost you $15.oo per day.  Do you want a boarding pass for your flight home?  That will cost you at least $5.00 to use their computer and .75 per page to print out your boarding pass. I tried to have room service bring me up some extra paper cups but they said they would have to charge me for them. To top things off, the people who work there are very rude.\nI usually stay at the Palazzo or the Venetian.  I tried the Rio because I was looking for an inexpensive room on this trip.  After all of the fees, I ended up spending more money per night at this sub standard hotel than I do at the more plush Palazzo.\n\nI will not return to this hotel.  It simply was not worth it.  Try the Palazzo and you will be glad you did."

1,"Closed on sundays. I came here a few times a few years back but didn't like it. It's a little dated inside- no frills, compared to Savers. But sometimes you can really find something for really cheap- lots of items are at fixed prices (skirts were $2.00). I found some good deals (found Kipling once) since rediscovering the store last year. I would go after visiting the credit union nearby. It's not very crowded. I agree with one reviewer on the boutique item prices being inflated. There is a sizable book section. Sometimes, there is a huge bin in front of the store in which one type of item (like backpacks) were dumped in that were priced at $1.00- but you have to dig (worth mentioning, but I didn't do that). The big housewares section has some beat up stuff but new things too. Sometimes the people working there are not in the best of moods. Worth checking out if you're in the area and it's not sunday."
1,"I'm in love. The festive d\u00e9cor charmed me the second I walked in the door. We sat down and were immediately greeting by a sweet waitress carrying a basket of chips. The chips were light and fresh and came with two salsas, a red and a green avocado salsa.\n\nWe ordered: Camarones aguachile hot drowned shrimp, Camarones culichi shrimps in a green sauce,tomatill & cilantro, rezongue enchiladas crab enchiladas in a red sauce. I also ordered a club soda and when the waitress asked if I wanted it prepared mexi style I said yes. What she brought back was a delicious mix of club soda, salt and muddled lime. It's my new favorite drink. \n\nWe patiently waited for our meal and remarked on the little mermaid scene in front of us. I almost expected the crustaceans to come to life and start playing music.  Then to our surprise little fish tostadas were dropped on our table. What a nice touch!\nThe dishes were excellent, all were paired with homemade tortillas, beans and white rice with vegetables.  The camarones culichi was my favorite.\n\nFresh seafood, fun atmosphere, great service."
0,"We all should know by now that the Palace Station is not a Palace! \n\nSo I stayed here for the cheap room rate I was expecting----- \n\nI saw on the Internet where you could stay for $28.00 for a night. What I didn't see was that in the upper right hand corner of the screen, there is an additional $14.99 tagged onto the room rate for some dumb*ss services that no one would more than likely use... Like free admission to the swimming pool! Notary service! (Notary!!!!) --- This is the Palace Station! People don't come here to do business, they come here to gamble, sleep, eat and limp around the joint... \n\nSo here I come thinking I'm paying $28.00 for a night---- \""No Sir! If you read the screen closely, you would see where the $14.99 is mandatory and for all the benefits listed on that poster over there(pointed to advertising panel),.... Umph*! I guess I'm stuck paying with tax over $58.00 when it was all said and done...$#!@!%$#%#$#@!@ \n\""NEVER AGAIN!\"" I told the woman behind the counter... as I checked in.... \""Good Luck staying in business in this economy!\"" \n\nI have Diamond level with Hilton, and I could have had a room with a full buffet breakfast for around $40.00 total during the week days... Soooo Pi*sed! \n\nOK... So I was duped.... The room at the Palace were the Courtyard rooms, not the tower. The room is about the size of a standard Motel 6 but skankier looking and smelling a bit like urine...ewwe! The shower is short for tall people above say 5'8\"" . You'd need to stoop to get your hair wet. And the soaps are so thin and sad. \nThe towels----well, don't get too wet, or you might not have enough towel to dry yourself off with one towel.... \n\nTo sum up this fiasco: For the money $58.00, most can more than likely stay in a more generous room elsewhere, and you might even get a decent breakfast with that!"
1,"Came here to eat with my SO on a rainy afternoon after waiting at Saigon for almost half an hour with other people in front of us. That place also has good pho but can get really packed! When we walked in, there were about 7 customers including us. Service was prompt, courteous, and quick. Their pho was awesome and the spicy wings we ordered were nothing short of excellent. I honestly think it's one of the best wings I've had. It wasn't breaded or overly flavored or anything like that... just deep fried and tossed in spicy sauce. Overall, a great experience and will definitely be a repeat customer."
0,"This is an update to my previous review.....\nWe went again last night, as sort of a \""second chance\"". The first time we went, we never made it into the attraction because they were \""closed due to technical difficulties\"". That was all well and good, but we were a little upset because the website didn't say that, so we made the trip. And management was so flippant, rude, and uncaring about the whole situation, that I gave it a two star review for poor customer service, but vowed to return and re-review once they had worked the kinks out.\nSo, last night, we went back. \nFirst-off, the staff was much friendlier this time, which was nice to see. And we did get to experience the attraction this time, which I was extremely excited about, being a huge fan of the genre.\nThe reason I was so excited, was because the trailer that was released, pre-opening, was so amazing, that I honestly thought that this was going to be a different experience than a standard \""haunted house\"" attraction. The barbershop scene was so realistic in that trailer, that this was on my must-do list.\nHere's the rub......\nThe trailer had absolutely nothing to do with what was actually inside the attraction. And while the walk-through was decent, it had none of the production values of the trailer, so it felt a lot like a bait and switch. It was all your standard rubber body parts and props, the usual air, water, and loud noise scares, and actors working in and out of the sets doing their best to add realism.\nIt wasn't a bad haunt by any means, and it probably would have warranted an extra star, if it wasn't for the price. \nBut the $40 price tag, is what is causing me to keep it at 2 stars, because it just wasn't worth the money. At $15, this would have been a 4 star review, maybe better. But for that price, and with the misleadingly amazing production value of the trailer, I truly expected a lot more. And unless they update it periodically, once you've seen it, there isn't any reason to go a second time.\nBaby Dolls Lounge had a lovely view, but it was 59 degrees last night, and there were no space heaters, making it too cold to stay too long."
1,"This is one of 3 Vegas properties and by far, this is the better one if you want to be closer to the Strip. As the other reviews said, nice pools, lazy river, nice sized rooms --- basically all the good stuff other reviewers have mentioned. If you're an owner, this is the place to stay in LV. For the most part, it's a nice place. \n\nNow, why did I take off one star. As another reviewer mentioned, the hard sell!! OMG, people, we are owners, you do NOT need to tell us how to vacation, what's new, how to save credits, what do to about affiliate memberships (RCI, II), we're old hats at this. And, we know how to read!! We keep up with things. SO, why is it you feel that you need to bug us about going down to your cheapo breakfast for an hour for you to tell me what I already know. If I say no, I already know all that and I'm only here for a few days and no, I did not make any time in my schedule to listen to your presentation, please believe me, leave me the heck alone and just give me my parking tag. Oh yeah, that's right. The sales person is holding your parking tag. She took 20 minutes of my time and wouldn't say no until I said, check w/ me later when the rest of the family arrived.\n\nGuess what, she called the room, later that afternoon to ask how many people were showing up to breakfast tomorrow. I said, the family hasn't arrived yet. She then called my cell later that evening to ask again. Good GOD!! When I got back to the room, I unplugged all the phones. I refuse to get a phone call at 8am the following day. We planned to party that night and crawling in at the crack of dawn.\n\nTIP: when you come in to the resort, the guard takes down your plates, hands it to you to give to the front desk. So as far as I'm concerned, you already know whose car is parked in your parking lot. I don't need my hang tag. Next time, I skip the hang tag from the \""resort host\"". Oh yes, to add, when you finally get out of the resort host's face, you get a little gift with toiletries. Whoopie!! I gave up 20 minutes in Vegas for that arguing with her. Also, if you show up for breakfast, you get $50 AMEX. She says, one less breakfast to cook. COOK? Heck, I'm in Vegas. I may have a kitchen but I'm sure as heck not cooking. I may have juice or some snackies but I left the cooking at home. And besides, $50 doesn't even cover a decent breakfast per person in Vegas and she thought it was one breakfast for the family. Did she think we were going to Dennys?\n\nOne last bit, in the afternoons, they make fresh popcorn by the lounge and some drink. We had lemonade. While nice and cold, as the day wore on, they must have been using the same lemons and sugar and just adding ice and water because it was getting more and more watered down. Good for hydration, I guess.\n\nLast last bit - I promise. As an owner, I plan to write a letter to Wyndham or at least let my annoyance be known about the pushy sales tactic. If every owner complained about it, hopefully they'll tone it down for owners."

1,"I was diagnosed diabetic in 2000.  I chose to visit Shearing-Westfield (as it was known then) because it was on a very short list of ophthalmologists in the company insurance directory, and it was the closest to home.  NO NEED TO LOOK FURTHER!  Front office staff, medical support staff, and doctors are all first-rate, professional, friendly, and just all-around nifty.  My wife has a history of eye injuries, and the personnel and services we both experienced have been superlative.  Due to the variety of services, examinations and tests available, any given patient may have to move from one area of the facility to another, but all this under one roof ... I could not think of a better organization.  Bravo, people."
0,So I decided to give this place another chance.....Bad idea. It smelt like the sewer system was backed up in there. AGAIN we were the ONLY ones in there. It took well over 40 minutes to get our food and that is including the time it took for them to remake our food because it was undercooked. The Health Department was in there and we should have left as soon as their A rating dropped to a B but since I work in the food business I understand that a B isn't necessarily a bad thing. All in all I really don't think they deserve my money a third time.
1,"My boyfriend and I were determined to get a tattoo in Vegas, however, I had neglected to bring my drawing with me so I was pretty unprepared.  We showed up around 11:15PM and were stoked to find out that they were open until 2:00AM.  I'm kicking myself in the butt for not getting the name of the tattoo artist, but his little area was the first one when you walk in the door.  He ruled.\n\nThey let me go online and print up the tattoo drawing that my sister had done and I gave him creative freedom with the layout and the colors.  He did my boyfriend first and then me and the tattoo artist just cracked us up!  He was playing 80's cover music on his iPod and just had a fantastic attitude.\n\nHIGHLY recommended and would for sure go back again for a cover up that I want to get."
0,"Not the best, chipotle is definitely much better. Compared to chipotle: The quantity is less, the salsas taste rather bland and they seriously load up on lettuce...Every.Time. \n\nI used to like this place in high school (about 4 years ago). But it gets worse and worse each time I went back (like 3 times since hs)."
0,"The service at this gym is AWFUL. Tried to cancel my membership today and they refused to do so since the Operations Manager had not shown up for the day yet. This was the icing on the cake. Regularly when trying to work out the trainers are pushing their services on you. The front desk employees seem like they'd rather be anywhere else and are downright rude. My father had purchased an expensive training package with them and ended up not using it and tried to transfer it to me. In order to do so they required he remain a member until the entire package was used, even though he had paid for the package and didn't want to belong to the gym anymore.\n\nHands down one of the worst gyms I've ever joined. Check out the Y, the people are friendly and the facility is well maintained."
0,"I was very upset at this location. It was my birthday, and all I really wanted was an awesome bowl of fresh made ice cream. As my girlfriend and I are getting ready to park, this car comes speeding right past in front of us to park in the handicap spot. Ok, so I thought, that was just a rude driver...nope, a group what we thought were teenagers jumping out of the car. They proceeded to walk into the ice cream shop. As my girlfriend and I walk in, these teenagers turn out to be employees, because there they were, behind the counter....I was pissed!!! Not only are their employees parking in the handicap spot, but they also almost hit us while we had the right of way. I really hope this was an anomaly, but needless to say, we turned around and walked right out. Now don't get me wrong, the ice cream there is great, but the unprofessional employees have made it so we will not come here anymore. Now...any good suggestions on a new ice cream spot?"
1,"It's a Dessert Bar. My girlfriend loves Dessert. I love alcohol (Bar). So, it's pretty easy for us to like this place. We went on Thursday after dinner and were pretty impressed by the whole place. It was pretty chic, sleek, modern and swanky. We liked the seating options, we sat in the tall booth-like seating along the wall,  It was comfy and had high back so if you lean back your head still hits cushion and not a hard wall. The booth-like seating was nice so couples can sit together.\n\nWe even enjoyed the music selection, i don't know what you'd call it, but it wasn't loud and obnoxious. There was a musician tuning up to play, but we ended up leaving before he finally started performing.  \n\nNow to the dessert...it seemed like a pretty good variety of dessert, we were hoping for a bigger selection of chocolate choices, but the one that we chose may as well be the only thing on the menu because it was so damn good. The Victorian was a chocolate cake, with chocolate mousse between layers and a rich chocolate icing (almost fudge like). \n\nNow to the drinks...A good selection. Being a cheapass when it comes to drinks, i was happy that they had some drinks at half price. Not sure if it is a regular thing, or just happened to be on that night. But, we tried 3 martinis. Martini is not my typical drink so i just tried some that were in the 1/2 off section. My special lady friend ranked them as so: 1. Fatal Attraction - really tasty, didn't seem very alcohol filled. 2. Mojito Martini - good taste, easy to drink, 3. Banana Cream Pie (?) - Thick, wasn't as tasty.\nNormal price was $9 for these martinis. They had some wine 1/2 off, but they didn't have a list.  The service was attentive. Cost of the desserts was around 7 or 8 dollars. We split the Victorian and it was plenty after just having eaten dinner. \n\nThey do indeed have a few things to iron out, but based on the dessert and atmosphere they earn a 5 star rating."
1,"Love this place! My friend wasn't able to make it out of town for the 4th, so to cheer him up I took him out for a night of fun. D&B was our second stop; we spent most of our time here because it's awesome!!!! Who doesn't like to kick back, have a few drinks then get crazy playing video games? There are enough games that everyone is pretty spread out and you only have to wait for a game if you really want to play it and someone just started playing. Most of the time if you are waiting to play, people play once then let other people go and keep rotating. It's nice to be in such a cool atmosphere, with music, drinks and video games. It's never too packed when I have gone and the food, service and drinks are affordable and good! It's a nice place to go to have a good time without having to go to multiple places and you are able to beat the hear. Everything you really need is in this one place! One tip, keep your players card, because you can reuse it if you don't use all your credits or your tickets!! Save them for next time! :)\n\nHad a great night! Thanks D&B!"

0,"I went there this weekend with a bachelorette party of 12 women.  We got there early so there was maybe a dozen people in the club.  I have been here before and I know the music here is great for dancing.  We got a table, and paid the $40 minimum tip they required, and we started dancing.  It didn't fill up until around 12 with people so we were there the entire night, and we were there paying for tons of drinks while the bar was near empty.  Then at 1:30 am in the morning the security guard who has tattoos everywhere, spiky hair, who thinks he is tough, came up to me and said I had to leave our table because he has it reserved for someone else.  Funny because we were here from 9:30pm until now, paying the server the whole night.  He told me I was a liar, and that I had to leave.  All the women's purses were here and I told him we had the table the entire night, all the women were off dancing so we would need 5 minutes at least (we were planning on leaving anyways).  He said no I couldn't have 5 minutes, he didn't care, and got up in my face.  Then I overheard him talking to the guys who replaced our table and they were his friends, not paying customers that he was screaming at me about telling me how my whole table was not a paying customer, and how I was a liar.  The server was gone half the night, we had to go up to the bar, and now I will never recommend this place because of the inconsiderate security guard, and staff, who were so RUDE when we did nothing wrong!!!!!!"
1,"I haven't been here in FOREVER. I've been meaning to get back to the spot though and visit an old co-worker SHOUT OUT TO GREG P.!! - Your late night bartender! \nAnyway, a few of us went after work and sat at a table in the bar. We had a friendly server and good sushi rolls and food! NOM NOM. Late night sushi/food/drinks/gambling!!! I will OBVIOUSLY be back!!!\n\nI guess they used to have all day happy hour or something but now it is 10% off however they did lower their initial price so the 10% is JUST a little more than what the all day happy hour prices were before so doooon't triiiip!!!"
1,"This was an awesome experience. The drinks were stiff & the appetizers we had were deliciously prepared. Compliments to our server \""Irene\"" as she was very well poised, humorous & very well informed of the menu. We received exceptional service hope to return for another magical night."
0,"I'm not sure where the cook got their recipe for red bell pepper hummus but just tossing some red peppers onto the top is like me slapping a \""My other car is a Porsche\"" bumper sticker on my Toyota.  Not only was it fake bell pepper, but I needed a toothpick to get the chickpeas out of my teeth.  \n\nNot to be dismayed I tried the meatballs.  I seriously should have quit at the hummus.  I couldn't really tell how many meatballs were on the plate as there was a ton of parm on it and not the nice freshly grated kind.  Clearly the cheese was there to cover the blandness of the  meatballs.\n\nOn the plus side, there are lots of TVs to watch sports and the staff is quite friendly.  Alcohol choices are basic but they do have a local brewery on tap. \n\nOnce they get the food thing improved it might be a fun place to go."
1,"EAT THE YELLOW SNOW!  \n\nCrap this place is good and it's right down the street from my house!  \n\nGet the tropical creme for 50 cents added to your shaved ice.  Got mine with red raspberry and it was awesome!  Not your typical cheap shaved ice here, they are serving high quality stuff.  I didn't think there were quality shaved ice joints, but this place is cool and they have a lot of options and other stuff besides shaved ice.  \n\nThey have board games, interactive social media music options on their jukebox and good service.  \n\nThe only con is that their prices are a bit high.  I'd recommend getting a \""Baby\"" size shaved ice for $2.99.  There is a lot of shaved ice in the small/regular sizes... Dare I say too much?"
1,"I've been here a few times now and have had a great experience every time!!!  I can only base this review on the pizza because I haven't tried anything else.  The employees have been friendly every time and the place is always clean.  Hard to find a place that makes Sicilian pizza out here and even harder to find a place that makes it good.  I get 2 slices every time I go, 1 regular and 1 Sicilian, and they are always MMM MMMM GOOOOOOD!!!   Thanks for bringing me back to NY even if it's only for the few minutes that it takes me to eat my slices."
1,"We were just here for our anniversary and had a great experience. First off make sure you sign up for their Rewards Club. We have been members for years so our room was comped. We do very little gambling but get these free room offers all the time so make sure you sign up. When we checked in we told the girl it was our anniversary and she upgraded our room to a deluxe room with a view of the strip for free.  Also they didn't charge us the resort fee which is $18/day. The service was excellent, especially liked the girl we had that cleaned our room. Very friendly and helpful. Bed was super comfortable and all room amenities were trouble free. We didn't eat here or go to one of their shows. We usually stay here because of its location on the center of the strip. Overall very enjoyable. We'll definitely be back. One thing to note there is a lot of construction next door at the Quad. So be prepared for a little difficulty getting into the back parking."
1,"Great local pub if you live in or near Mountain's Edge.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  They have a traditional bar for adult nights out and a separate dining room if you're feeding the kiddies.  Reasonable prices and good food, you can count on Rounders for good times, people and eats."
0,"Parking sucks.. Valet full, self parking full. Staff told us to be patient when driving around full self parking area waiting for someone to leave"
0,"We were a party of 6, 3 couples, one of them had been there before and highly recommended the restaurant. Service was excellent I will start with that, food on the other hand was very very disappointing. I had the ribeye, asked for it medium rare, they brought a piece of meat, that I am sorry to say seemed like it was cooked by a child. It was well done on the top side, and 3/4 on the bottom side, and now that I think about it, they did not bring out a rib eye, it seemed more like skirt to me. My fiancee had the lobster ravioli, the raviolis were fine but the sauce was extra salty, to the point where she was taking it off because it was unedible. A point to of view shared by the other people eating pasta. The manager was very thoughtful wishing to cook the plates for us again, but we kindly refused. I would not come here again, service was great, but someone in the kitchen needs a cooking lesson."
1,Great place! Stopped here on a whim with a friend from out of town and really enjoyed it. The food was fantastic and the service was even better! Definitely go to this place if you're in the area:)
0,"This place was meh. We came for dinner since we were staying at a hotel down the street and read the yelp reviews. When we walked in, we were the only ones there (although a family with some very loud children came in towards the end of our meal). The decor is polished, and there was one man who seemed to be the server and cook when we arrived. We ordered the lychee martini, fried tofu and seitan, lamb curry, red curry grilled chicken, and yellow curry soup. The tofu was okay, but the seitan was bitter and completely inedible (I normally love seitan!), and the dipping sauces were wayyy too salty. My family really didn't like the lamb curry, although the lychee martini wasn't bad, and I didn't mind my soup. Overall, the meal was a little disappointing."
1,"Love this place. Fast, courteous service including a free glass of champagne if you like!  The prices are reasonable, far more so than most other places I've seen in Charlotte and I was able to get in and out in about an hour, even with a packed house!  This will be my regular go-to place when I'm in need of some mani-pedi pampering!"
1,"Looking for a nice dive bar in Scottsdale with a splash of Irish festivities? Look no further than Patties. This is probably the spot my friends and I head to to start our night or end it. Saying this early: I'm not sure about price but if my receipts from past weekends are any indication, it's not too expensive at all.\n\nIf you go in the early evening Patties is pretty dead and quiet but gives you free room to play pool, shuffleboard etc. After 10 p.m. rolls through, this place quickly fills up. There's plenty of places to stand and sit if you snag them early, but careful as each part of the bar can get congested and tight (especially if you're trying to move through the middle of the bar)\n\nMusic can be hit or miss. Last night I wasn't feeling the music rotation but last weekend I was all over the dance floor so just be prepared if you're looking to hit the floor here.\n\nThis is probably my go-to spot now in Scottsdale. Good atmosphere, really colorful design and a popular dive bar that doesn't come off as high-class and overpriced."
1,"Had company in town for the week and booked the stay at Drury Inn & Suites. Now I have driven by this place many of times when on the freeway and never once did I think to check them out, glad I got the chance too.\n\nRoom 617 was the one, on the 6th floor with a view of the airport & freeway, but really it didn't matter I could watch the planes all day.  Inside the room was a huge king size bed, a flat screen tv, a love seat, coffee table, microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker and of course closets & dressers. The bathroom was nice too, inside the shower was a dispenser for shampoo and conditioner, kinda cool I thought. \n\nThe room was clean the staff was friendly, and the cost wasn't something that would break your pocket book. Over all it's a great place if you are staying in the valley for a few days, and I'm glad I got to check it and I will be referring  it to out of state family and guest for next year for my  daughters wedding :)"
1,"All you people that gave bad reviews are CRAZY!!! The burgers here are AMAZING!!! I've been to Vegas way too many times and I HAVE to stop here and get a burger every time! I think the reason people don't like it is that they are used to the fancy, glittery restaurants that are dominating the strip. This place isn't really decorated, it kind of reminds me of a high school cafeteria...HOWEVER the burgers are DELICIOUSSSSS. Who cares if they didn't waste time decorating? I didn't go there to look at the walls, I went there TO EAT!!! I personally think the prices are very reasonable. Like what the hell, you aren't gonna get a burger and fries for 8 dollars anywhere else on the strip!! I love this place. Cheap and greasy. I LIKE IT!"
1,"Fish tacos are very good\n\nGuacamole is fantastic although the tortilla chips seemed like something only slightly better than you'd buy at the supermarket, which really confused me as the tortillas for the tacos were obviously freshly made in house.\n\nPrices at lunch were reasonable by Vegas standards, dinner seemed high for what is essentially good-very good Mexican."
0,Saw some good yelp reviews expected more from this place. I recently got into juicing so I was super excited when I heard they have juices too. \n\nGot the Bison cheese steak in a spinach wrap. It was comparable to taco bell taco meat. And the tofu fries were pretty good just too salty on the outside edges. \n\nI also got the wellness drink. Never saw any of the ingredients I read on the board being run through a juicer. Saw some stuff going into a blender though. THAT'S NOT JUICING.
0,"WORST PLACE TO GET YOUR HAIR DONE!!\n\nI was so excited to get my hair done at Moda Forte and it was my first time with them. To begin with, there was an incident between two of the hair stylist fighting over a hand mirror that was missing. They argued in-front of everyone and made the environment totally uncomfortable and unprofessional. Then the lady dying my hair did not dye my hair the color I wanted. I specifically told her what I was hoping for or atleast something close. She dies my hair an ugly copper brown. Then, two different stylist were cutting and dying my hair so the I had to re-explain what kind of hair cut i wanted to the second stylist. I can go on! Uncomfortable atmosphere, rude, did not give me what I wanted, and i drove an hour to North Scottsdale to not be happy with my hair. Seriously take my advice, or see for yourself. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!"
1,This is a great place to kick back and enjoy a margarita.  There's plenty of tequilas to choose from and they have great food.  Try the pomegranate a\u00e7ai margarita and the chile rellenos.  Both got rave reviews at our table.
0,"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I saw my watch under my seat and needed to grab it. I was occupied with something else. I ended up forgetting to grab it. At the end of  my car wash I then went to look for it. Management showed me the sign that said they were not responsible and told me to file a report (send to corporate who were not even at the scene). The manager (Jose) said he \""asked\"" everyone about it when I physically saw him only ask two people. This is a terrible establishment and they have now lost a customer for life for their lack of honesty. DO NOT TRUST THIS PLACE WITH YOUR BELONGINGS!!"
0,"Ya..this place is nothing to write home about. Very small place. No music, strangely quiet. The guacamole,chips and salsa were  amazing but the rest of the food was rather bad. I had the Shrimp Enchiladas and they came out with some kind of sauce not resembling enchilada sauce at all. The shrimp was fishy and the rice and beans were bland. Maybe I should give it a second chance before I write it off all together."
0,"We came, we saw benches, never saw a host to seat us even though the signs said wait to be seated, we left and we won't return. No love from this place so no love for it."
0,Perhaps I can see better if the non-glare eyeglasses I paid extra hard-earned money for actually is non-glare! Shame on you Optic Gallery for asking me to pay more so you can give me better quality eyeglasses and shame on me for trying you out just because it was convenient for me! I should've gone back to Yesnick Vision Center where I got my 1st pair of non-glare eyeglasses last year for way less than what I paid you guys. It would've been worth the extra 15-minute drive! Talk about extreme buyer's remorse!
1,"Great Italian food, pizza is a wood fired oven and amazing pizza dough.  \n\nAnd dont forget the canoli!"
0,"I brought in my 5 month old German Shepherd because she threw up 8 times yesterday.  Keep in mind she was drinking & eating, just vomiting yellow bile & some of the chicken I gave her in her bland diet.  She got spayed a week ago & on two different antibiotics.  The doctor came in to feel her belly, told her there might be a blockage.  What!!!!  She doesn't have a blockage!  She had the cone on for a week w/ no access to anything.  Trust me there is no blockage.  The Dr. came in & wanted to keep her overnight.  I'm sure the $1300 for an overnight stay on a dog that is stable & not distressed sounded good for profit.  We chose an anti nausea medication & took her home.  Well, she's fine.  I used my gut instinct, feed her every two hours , smaller amounts, got her well hydrated.  Miraculously she's energetic, playing & thriving.  $1300 for sure was a money scheme to me."
0,"Lame in my opinion. \n\nSuper dead, and very few options of food and shopping.\n\nYou want a Hawaiian marketplace? Fork out the cash and go to Hawaii instead!"
1,"Can't say anything bad about this place.  Staff is great, food is great, great location by the gym and my house.  Spicy chicken or teriyaki beef are my go to entrees.  \nI usually take mine home and throw an over easy egg on top if the bowl.  yum!"
0,"This restaurant replaced the Wendy's that was once here, and is currently the only option for food in the D-terminal. I ordered take out once, service was terrible, and I'm never coming back.\n\nI give it a try, so I order the Torta del Barrio to go, with fries. It's a vegetarian option for $13, including cheese stuffed peppers among other vegetables. One gentleman was in front of me, so I wait after my order.\n\nThree people order after me within 15 minutes, each ordering items on the menu of similar preparation (one even got the same dish). They were ALL SERVED BEFORE ME! I ended up waiting for 35 minutes for a meal that wasn't even that good. The fries were soggy and bland, and the bread for the torta tasted stale. No way that cost $13, I could've made that for under $5.\n\nThe restaurant didn't look that much better. The place was packed, and they pumped out a couple dishes every 10 minutes. The majority of tables were not served the entire time I was there, and they definitely ordered before I arrived.\n\nWhen you're trying to fly out, you want a quick bite to eat. The 35 minutes wait was inexcusable, especially since all those customers were served until I was dead last. The most I got out of the cashier was \""Sorry, I tried.\"" If you're going to serve food at the airport, that kind of service won't cut it.\n\nI've never said this before, but I'd have preferred fast food at the time."
1,"Went once, many, many moons ago.  Had a great server, and I regret to have forgotten his name.  Too bad, 'cause he was a cutie...\n\nOrdered a medium spinach pie w/ original white flour crust (Mom's favorite) and a medium whole-wheat thin-crust Marguerite for us to share.  (I always try to order whole-wheat, 'cause if I don't, I feel so guilty having pizzas, and guilt is never a welcomed guest to any meal gathering!)  We also ordered a small salad to share, and our awesome server did not hesitate to bring more salad upon request!  \n\nThe beautiful pizzas took about 15 minutes to arrive, but the Marguerite pie looked tiny compared to the spinach, and when we mentioned it to the server, he didn't even skip a beat.  He agreed that the pie looked like a small, and less than ten minutes had passed when he delivered a larger pie.  Fantastic service!  Great customer service, people, that's what it's all about!!  (Some of you would beg to differ, but I'm sure you have your list of now-defunct restaurants that served SUPERB food, but lacked great customer service.  Am I right?)\n\nSo, yes, if thin-crust pizzas are your thing, as they are mine, then definitely check out Nello's!  I've eaten at both Southern/McClintock and Guadalupe/Alma School locations.  I've tried the antipasti platter at the Old Town Scottsdale location, and didn't care for it.  I'll give OTS another try, though, and order pizzas so that I may give an appropriate review!"
0,it's just that...stay away unless you are in need more than your life.
1,"I guess for $8, the selection is worth it. The pasta station was the best part. The cook made me a great shrimp fettuccine Alfredo.\n\nI still would go here when I am looking for a quick buffet to go to.\n\nThey had great prices on drinks too!"
0,"I like this CVS because it's close to home and open 24 hours. The store itself is alright. I like that they sell booze, most of which is less expensive than Total Wine across the parking lot. The cashiers can be slow but they are usually nice. The problem with this CVS is the pharmacy. They are a little clueless and some techs are just rude. About a month ago I filled a script there and they said it would take an hour. I needed this script ASAP so I killed time in the area. An hour later it wasn't ready. I'd say I waited a little over two hours for this medicine and then when it was finally ready the pharmacist wanted to 'go over it with me' even though I had taken it before. Yeah right.  He told me I need to get off this med ASAP because it is probably one of the worst ones out there. Excuse me? Are you my doctor? No. MInd your own business. Your only job here is to fill my script and tell me how to properly take it, not tell me your opinion. My doctor gave me this for a reason! I was extremely upset at this point and just left. I called a few days later and spoke to the store manager who I believe is named Jason. He took down my name and number and said the district manager was going to call me. This was a couple weeks ago and I've heard nothing. I really hope this pharmacist is not saying these type of things to other customers. This was so incredibly unprofessional and off putting. (I don't remember his name but he has a hook for a hand). If anybody has had a similar experience with this man please call the store manager and let them know! This is not okay!!"
1,"3.5 stars.  Very nice \""upper-crust\"" Italian place.  Pastas were typically $12-15 and Special entrees were typically $15-$30.  I visited on a Thursday night, no waiting, and few people there.  Very nice, comfy decor with red velvet drapes, dim lighting, white table-cloths, and picasso-like paintings all around.  Service was ok...the water-boy was good, but the waiter sporadically came by my table...always a bit late, and two waiters actually waited on me.  The menu had too much cream and pink sauce for me.   No whole wheat pastas.  One waiter actually helped me design my own meal which was nice.  I asked for a small side of arrabbiata  sauce expecting a hot red sauce, but made a cheesy, creamy mushroom sauce for me instead.  The complimentary bread was a bit stale and came with a cheesy stiff buttery kinda sauce...I had to ask for olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  They have a dining room and a separate lounge with a live jazzy band.  I think there's a private conference room too."
1,"Since we've moved here my husband and I eat here all the time.. The good is beyond good. Everything is flavored VERY well and the portions are very good. The customer service is awesome and super friendly. The lunch are dinner special combos are great. My husband and I always get a dinner combo B and it's so much food that he has lunch left overs for at least 2 days (which he loves) I absolutely LOVE the crab ragoons here, they are soo good and actually have filling in them which seems to be a rare occurrence at most Chinese places now for some reason. Not to mention the house rice.. It's literally loaded down with pork, chicken, AND shrimp. This is by fat our favorite place to eat."
0,Panda Express sounds good. I only gave them 2 stars because it was dirt cheap.
0,NOT SAFE... PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE\n\nAs the reviewer on 2/25/2012. PLEASE READ!! The same thing happen to else on 2/20/2012. We were robbed also around 4 am while we were asleep. This is a crazy thing.... We found are wallets in the middle of floor and all cash gone also. Will never stay there again.
0,"I have tried Richardson's on a number of occasions, none of which were busy.  Mainly I've gone because it serves dinner until midnight, is close and has been recommended by friends.\n\nFirst off, know that the parking chews.  An old school angled strip mall lot that is on much too busy of a corner to approach from the 'wrong' direction.  Second, they never seem to know who is supposed to be seating people.  Is there a host?  Is the bartender staring at you and your guests blankly while taking a phone call supposed to do it?  The second time I snagged a menu and plopped myself down. On none of my three visits have I entered the door and received my drink in less than a 15 minute interval.\n\nOk, now for some positives!  The dark, candlelit decor is quite relaxing.  I also enjoy the copper topped bar and large pillows in the booths to bolster us shorter folk.\n\nMaybe this place is just not for everyone.  There are some tasty dishes I've come across but their sides are tired, especially the GCP which never sounded good to begin with.  No one I've brought with me has been able to spot any values on the menu, including myself so I suppose the large bill at the end isn't doing anything to help my view of this place."
1,"One of the few places in Las Vegas I'm actually comfortable in.  The strip feels superficial and vapid, locals avoid it anyway.  The Artifice has easy parking compared to most places downtown, the inside is gorgeous, there's plenty of seating and the bar is huge.  I haven't tried ordering anything crazy yet, but I'm sure if I was feeling whimsical the bartenders would have me covered.  I've been here for the goth night Scarlet, as well as a regular night when a cover band was playing a free show.  Always a fun atmosphere."
0,"Came here for lunch and had a lunch special pizza. It was a \""thin crust\"" pizza, and while it was a good deal (pretty big pizza for $6.95), it was probably on par with a frozen pizza from the grocery store...\n\nI will say the service was friendly and quick, and the space is BIG and CLEAN with nice new flat screen TVs. \n\nThey also have a pretty AWESOME VIEW of the strip :)"
1,AHHHHH-MAZING!! I called in for pick-up and ordered a pasta dish with a pound of wings. The smell on the drive home tempted me so much. The food was great and the wings were perfection. Being from the east coast -- I know wings and these were amazing. Will definitely order from them again and hopefully stop by and hang out inside soon.
0,"Salle tr\u00e8s bruyante, ambiance cantine, \u00e7a passe encore.\nMais grosse d\u00e9ception sur les pizzas : pas de gout, garnies \u00e0 l'arrache, p\u00e2te seche....Le tout pas donn\u00e9. J'ai mang\u00e9 de bien meilleures pizzes \u00e0 mtl."
0,"I've always wanted to try the Farmhouse since I've heard it is so wonderful and it looks so cute. I went this morning with my friend and of course it was packed. We opted for a sunny seat on the patio rather than waiting for an inside seat even though it was a cold January morning.  I think that may have been our biggest mistake.  After we got our coffee,  it took a full 30 minutes for our not so friendly waitress to take our order. When we finally did get our order, we had to request coffee refills and ask for pancake syrup.  It got to the point where we felt like we were an inconvenience to our waitress. We were not impressed and the food wasn't worth going back for."
1,I'm not much of a reviewer but I know customer service when I see one. The service in this location was truly an amazing experience especially when it was our first time eating Barro's Pizza. Kaitlyn (not sure if I spelled the name correctly) served us with an amazing smile despite of how busy she was. The Pizza was great and it was hot and fresh.Tim the manager did a great job by making sure we and along with everyone else was happy with everything. Tim and Kaitlyn trully helped Barro's earn a new customer. Thank You for the Great Service!
1,"Did a Chicago Bears fan really drive all the way out from Desert Ridge to Chandler to join some friends for happy hour trivia at a Packers bar?  Yes I did.  And even though I was not a fan of the green and yellow decor, I still managed to enjoy a fun Friday night at Stadium Club.\n\nThe happy hour is pretty good.  For about $10 (including tip) I had a giant glass of Fat Tire and an order of sliders.  The sliders were really good.  Not too greasy and well complemented on a toasted brioche bun.\n\nNo complaints.  Except for all the Packers decor."
0,This place is cheap so it's a good place to eat. But make sure you check your bank statements. Several times they have charged our card for more than what our bill said. They added their own tip when we left cash on the table. Check your statements!!!!
1,"Wow. What a gem. Owners super nice and let us sample everything we wanted. Real fresh ingredients that you can taste in every bite. This is a place that you are so happy to find and will definitely be coming back to again and again. My wife got the sweet corn and also avocado, really unique flavors but really good."
1,"By far the BEST uber fresh Uni spot in Vegas. The quality of the fish is outstanding and Alfredo at the Sushi Bar is a delight and truly enjoys his job. Delightful spot on off hours, especially early for the top selection of high quality selection."
1,"Sorry, but I have to knock off a star from my other review.  I have been here several times.  The last time I went, it was a late Friday night, and I wanted a concrete.  I decided to go inside, we were the only ones in the place.  Didn't get that overly welcome feeling I always get when I come here.  I got the Turtle concrete and hubby got the M&M concrete.  When we came home, it was hardly blended at all!  The yummy chocolatety goodness, pecans on mine were at the bottom, same for the M&M's in hubby's concrete.  I told the cashier it was to go, but we got the overflowing cup and had to ask for a lid.  Not cool at all.  But, since it is tasty, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to an off night."
0,I would only suggest coming to this buffet if you are in the area and have one of those handy 2 for 1 deals.  There was a limited selection and the food was just meh.  Not horrible but not great either.\n\nThere are so many other buffet options in the area that are far better than at TI- and if I had to pay full price I would have been severely disappointed.
1,"i have always had good service and good food here.  the mango mojo is great.  the drink machine is amazing, so many flavors.  The place is clean.  They have free wifi.  You really cant go wrong here."
0,"Folks saying this place is great, either have never had Greek Gyros before or are related to the owners.  Not good at all.  Small portions, dry, chewy meat with grissle.  Yuk.   \n  Now let's all gasp in awe of Rob T. down there and his awesome skills at judging Jodi for having an opinion that's different than his.  Dork."
0,"I recently attended a conference at Caesars Palace, and our company held a cocktail reception in one of their Presidential Suites, and found the suite more than lacking!   Not only did we have to wait until 4pm to check in, but when we finally got into the suite, the real issues began.\n\nIt was dirty (carpet had really filthy areas, the door jam outside looked like someone had spilled beer on it, and several yellow upholstered chairs were so dirty I had to move them out and hide them in a closet); the furniture was chipped, tablecloths had holes in them   When I requested housekeeping to help clean up some of the filth on the door and in the service area, they showed up 2 hours later.  By that time I had already cleaned the grime away.  (Note that all of the staff that came by to help were very nice and really tried to fix the issues -- such as get the air conditioner to work, and get the front double door to closes!) \n\nIt also came with no standard-stocked items.  When I requested a coffee pot to replace the K-cup maker, they told me I had to \""rent\"" one for $40; to get a corkscrew required calling room service and paying for them to deliver one, etc, etc. etc.  \n\nThe final ding was that for over $800/night, our not-so-lovely view was of the back of the Caesar's sign.  \n\nIf you are looking for a high-quality suite, don't come to Caesars!"
0,"Stayed for three nights July 16-19.\nFirst we faced a rude employee at the entrance that told us that we were wrongly parked.... and told us to self park before checking in. This was very uncomfortable to carry 4 suitcases from the highest level in the parking garage to the check in counter. If he had any service-mind he could have told us to unload our luggage and then park our car.... but not at this hotel.... \nCheck in is a nightmare at Flamingo - it took over an hour...... \nWe had heard that they had remodeled the hotel, but it is worn again and do not have rooms like many of the other nicer hotels in Vegas.....\nThe breakfast areas at the hotel is terrible and dirty and with worn furnitures (the leather arm chairs have big holes and rips in them)\nI believe everything at the hotel shows on bad or terrible Management and that they have lost touch in running a great hotel.\nIt is sorry because Flamingo has a great location and is one of the truly classic hotels in Vegas."
0,"Ordered moo shu gai pan, pork chow mein, fried dumplings, and crab ragoon. The rice was dry, noodles are greasy, they used canned mushrooms, and the egg rolls were bland. Rather eat Panda express."
0,"Like others have said, the burgers are really greasy.  They leave a greasy film all over the place.  The smash fries were mediocre at bes, the fired pickles we decent.  I asked numerous times when ordering that I wanted CRISPY bacon.  Of course the bacon was anything but crispy.  The grilled onions were greasy as well.  Create a Burger was better, but for equivalent money I prefer to go to Red Robin.  If you haven't tried them yet, then get to Tommy's and In-n-Out."
1,"3 words: OH MY GOD\n\nWe came to this place dressed like dirtbags, tired from walking and not looking like we had money.. but you know what?  The first thing that happened was we were greeted like we owned the place.  \n\nRight from the minute we got there, the staff was courteous, respectful and very helpful.  The place is as classy as it gets, definitely every bit the luxurous joint it puts itself out to be.  Awesome view of the city, great lighting and the staff were dressed very nice.\n\nThe food..... What can I say?  This food was very spendy.. But worth every single dollar.  The meal was absolutely delicious.. Definitely something I will not forget. \n\nMy wife and I spent quite a bit of time there even after we ate, talking with the waiter and getting our picture taken.\n\nIf you come to Las Vegas, screw the slot machines, spend your money here and absolutely positively assure you that you will NOT be sorry.\n\nTop of Binions is where its at for fine dining.  The wife and I are coming back to Vegas this July and this is definitely one of the places we will come back to."
1,"Once again, amazing service! Lee and the guys are always so friendly and welcoming there and they take the time to explain what needs to be done. I went in for a smog check and see why my check engine light was on so i can get my registration renewed. They were able to diagnose, order and fix everything in less than 2 days while keeping me updated on the process. It also came out much less than I expected :) I will refer them to anyone! Thanks again Rebel!"
1,"The Nachos are awesome! Really cool environment to kick back, chill, and get your grub and drink on. Can't wait to come back!"
1,"Came here on a double date for the first time, it was awesome!\nI've never been mini golfing in my life.\nBut the experience was great, also my boyfriend and I did get to bond as he was teaching me how to play lol\nI came again at another time with my little brother. He loved it.\nIt is a great place for a group of friends or even a family.\nLove it!"
1,"Best Sushi place in all of Henderson!  There fish is the freshest I have eaten in the middle of the desert with no \""fishy\"" taste at all!   If your new to sushi go with the Screaming O and a triple A roll.  You will not be disappointed!"
0,this is such a long miserable story all i can say is pick another airline
1,"Great service, super prices, and friendly, attentive wait staff.\n\nAngela, one of the waitresses, is an absolute doll.   :-)\n\nWe will definitely be back."
0,"Here we go again!  I bought 2 Groupons for this restaurant & our 1st experience was horrible.  The Groupon was expiring so we thought we could just go for Happy Hour-wine & some appetizers.  On the website the Happy Hour says $2 off glasses of wine and appetizers 1/2 off!  We went on a Friday @5 because the HH was from 5-7.  Once we were seated and ordered a bottle of wine the server proceeded to tell us about specials-we told him we were there for HH and he said they don't do that anymore!  I assume what he meant was the pricing?  We ordered 2 appetizers and a bottle of wine.  Our Groupon for $40 of food still cost another $40-$80 for HH!  Ridiculously overpriced for poor service and average (&that's stretching it) food!  Burnt bread, once again-how do you burn bread?  They apparently lay it on a grill and forget it!  We had mussels in wine sauce(a special) & the antipasto plate.  We will NEVER go back there and honestly are wondering when we will see a closed sign on the door-I do not know how they stay open!  Would not recommend with or without a Groupon, overpriced and not good food!"
0,Now normally I would not give a whataburger this low of a rating. But back in Dec on a vacation I came back from a bar late on a Sunday night went to this whataburger and they had no meat! We went to the drive up menu where greeted. Told them it would be a minute. We took ten minutes and finally when we decided what we wanted we where THEN told they where out of meat. Sigh.
0,"I guess I didn't realize that the produce wouldn't be there yet,  which is my main reason for going to a farmers market.  Way too many flower stands and a few places to eat.  Not really what I was looking for but I'll try again in a few weeks to see if the veggies show up."
0,"I had high hopes when we decided to eat here last night since everyone has said it was delicious. Sadly we were beyond disappointed.  It took our server 15 minutes to greet us, my iced tea had very little ice in it, my father ordered a bottled beer and got Draft instead, I bit into a large piece of plastic in our fried calamari and all I got was a \""sorry\"" from our server, it wasn't taken off our bill nor did a manager even stop by. And to top it all off the pizza was sadly disappointing and extremely overpriced. I wouldn't recommend pizza rock to anyone."
1,"Definitely in my top 2 of favorite dim sum list. This is located near the Carnival World Buffet inside Rio so take that into consideration when parking. We ended up parking on the opposite end. It's busy here but we only waited 10 minutes to get a table (on a  weekend). This has got to be nicest, fanciest and cleanest dim sum restaurant I've been to.\n\nThere were carts that would pass by every 5 minutes. I didn't see my favorite dim sum items though like the roast pork and deep-fried minced pork/beef dumplings. We were there for at least an hour so, I doubt we missed it.\n\nWe got har gow, siumai, chicken feet (I don't eat feet of any animal), roast duck, shrimp wontons, baked cha siu bao, steamed cha siu bao (BBQ pork buns), crispy shrimp roll, salt and pepper shrimps, egg custard, shrimp balls, calamari and sweet tofu. My favorites were: roast duck, shrimp balls and sweet tofu - they have the best version of these dishes in town. I've had sweet tofu that has a strong ginger flavor...KJ's version is just right.\n\nGimme sum dim sum!"
0,No DD here.  It's gone.  I apparently can't find an actual DD near ASU
0,"This place is a go-to for me on days I can't get out of work on time to go home for lunch. The 2 stars are for the insta-shits I got after eating a mostly mediocre whopper with cheese today. In all seriousness, beware. It was no bueno."
0,"I love thai food and while the waitress was super nice the food was just so so. I'm use to much more flavorful thai food. I also got really sick later that evening. I really want to blame the food, but one can never be 100% sure. I did end up throwing my leftovers away. \n\nI got the massuaman curry, the boyfriend got some soup/noodle dish, best friend got pad thai, and her friend ordered their version of drunken noodles. They were all adequate but not \""good\"". If you're looking for really good thai, try Nicky's on the North Side or in Verona."
0,"Stopped by at 12:30pm on a Thursday and they were closed. No sign, no explanation. Was very disappointed because I've heard so many good things about this place."
0,Do NOT recommend.  Horrible Customer Service.  Owner (Kenny) swears at customers.  Plenty of other mechanics in town that treat customers with respect.
1,"I never knew there was a Sephora in this location before! I went inside and easily broke the bank. Had a nice selection of pretty much everything. Love this place, will come back here more often."
0,"We'll that do I have to say... Once you walk in you get hounded by the workers., 1st when you walk in then like 3 in the middle of the store then like 3 cashiers in  the back . Like I know customers is good but they take it to the next level, when I get attacked by the workers I just want to tell them to leave me alone , when I go shopping In there I have my head phone on and volume up so they won't bug me I have walked out a few time and just bought what I need online just to stay away from the pushy workers ,"
0,"I visited here from out-of-state to check it out.  My first observation was that it was quite proud of itself for being \""the best breakfast in Pittsburgh\"".  I got here right at 8 am on a Saturday, and so the lines weren't out the door and down the street by that time.  However, once I got seated - 8:10 am or so - the line by then had already gotten rather long.  Make sure you come here early.\n\nMultiple food shows, most notably Man v. Food, have come here to check out their breakfast.  Their menu, for starters, is extremely long.  They have everything ranging from a 2-pound breakfast burrito to pancakes covered with whipped cream and strawberries to large omelettes.  However, I got the Mixed Grill, as it was what the server recommended.\n\nThe Mixed Grill was not good at all.  The eggs were good, but I didn't think the veggies tasted that fresh.  After a while, the taste of each bite got pretty predictable.  Unlike what Adam famously said on Man v. Food, the Mixed Grill was not at all healthy despite having tons of veggies.  This place is a greasy spoon, health nuts beware.\n\nThe service was always busy, and it seemed as if they didn't have enough staff available to tend to all our needs.  The layout is also fairly small, but the location prohibits it from expanding much.\n\nWhile I also could have probably picked the wrong thing to order, Deluca's is not for the claustrophobic or the impatient."
1,Food is always good.\nThe empolyies are nice and friendly.\n\nask for the thai hott :D \n\nthe beef is cooked well. \n\nThe rice is sticky just the way it should be.
0,"Well this is a total fail. I went to Mr. Lucky to get my favorite Nachos with chicken and asked about the Nachos. I don't like when they use the extra salty ones because the meal just taste like salty cheese. Some people might like that but not me, I'm watching my Sodium. So I can no longer have my Favorite dish here. Trying the something else is not always great but the rest of the food was ok."
0,"Been coming here for years and we used to LOVE to spend lots of money.   Well, not anymore.   The management messed up our reservation, lied about it and then stuck us in a hole in the back of a room and it was literally 100 degrees.  We dont come here for the food, which is just mediocre, we come for the atmosphere, and as stated before, that was ruined by a messed up reservation. Had conversation with DVP and he explained what transpired and took full blame for botched reservation and how whole situation was handled."
0,"Awful experience. \n\n1. Slow registration process. Really slow. \n2. The TV was on some weird channel that repeated the same commercials and weather report every 5 minutes.\n3. After waiting for an hour in the waiting room, I left after finding out there was only one \""provider\"" (the receptionist is very, very careful to always say \""provider\"" and never say \""doctor\"") working...and that he or she was not a medical doctor."
0,"My friends and I went to Sandey's Broaster Chicken on 1155 S Higley in Mesa, AZ. As loyal customers we are highly disappointed in the change. They have added an Indian Buffet to the restaurant. The macaroni and cheese was not cheesy but tasted like flour and was soupy. The cole slaw had an after taste to it like it had not been properly covered in the refrigerator at night and absorbed the odor of other foods. After leaving the restaurant the smell of the Indian curry lingered in our nostrils and attached to our clothing. Unfortunately, we will now have to find a new Broaster Chicken restaurant. We will not be going back."
0,"Not family friendly, the food is mediocre but our waitress was great. She needs a new job! Its too bad the management doesn't focus on the food. The queso is heated velveeta, the hamburger buns a day away from stale & ok burgers. Additionally smokers allowed to blow smoke in your face if you sit on the patio- horrible experience."
0,Another John Taffer bar that closed.
1,"I go into Clothes Minded at least every couple of weeks to see what's new... the styles are right on trend, the jewelry is amazing & one of a kind, the clothes are great for dressy and casual and the shop is adorable.  Plus Kim the owner is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet - and she gives great style advice!!"
0,"This experience was just meh! I have experienced much better.  The drink menu is a joke! You just have to guess how much a soda, beer, or mixed drink will cost you...there are no prices listed anywhere for the drinks.  I wanted a Bloody Mary but wasn't sure if I would even like it here.  \n\nThe rib tips we ordered had so many spices on them I had to scrape it off with my knife...they were inedible to me.  The cole slaw was great and so was the service.\n\nWon't be coming back here...highly disappointed. : ("
0,"The food and drinks are great but they get a low rating because every time I go there the bar is full of children that are screaming or running around.  They are close to my work but the last thing I want after a hard day is to go to a bar for drinks, food, conversation, or to watch a game, and be sitting next to a table of 3 or 4 kids in a bar.  Even the several times coworkers and I have gone there for lunch to relax, there has always been a table in the bar with 3 or 4 young children.  Often being loud and throwing things like their menus around.     They have several screens with games on. But this bar is never going to be a place where many people want to come unwind with the bar full of loud children. They need to take a lesson from Red Robin (who's bar is always packed) and make it 21 and over only.  On my last visit I heard a guy at the next table who was annoyed by 3 loud children seated in the bar say, maybe the bar should have a toddler section. The mother was oblivious and stayed on her cell phone for at least 10 minutes while the children entertained themselves and made noise.  I would say that 5 of my last 6 visits, there have been loud children in the bar. My coworkers and I will have to look for another place to stop after work and for lunch."
1,Very good Chinese can be had here. We came prior to seeing Raw at the arena. The shrimp and langostino dish I had was yummy as were the dumplings. Very clean too.
1,"So we came here after finding out Rokerij doesn't serve the new Mexican food anymore. My Lil Sis was in town and the rellenos were a must ! My Mom, both Sisters and I came on our girls day after the art museum and shopping. It was the perfect way to end the day ! Our food was amazing !!!!!! The enchiladas and rellenos were out of the world !!! All I wanted in life at that moment ! I also tried the carne adovada and cordon bleu, they were very good also. We had the skewers thinking that were like the rokerij version, but they weren't, still good though. We finished with the flan and sopapillas. The flan was really good. I am not crazy about flan, but I really enjoyed theirs. The sopapillas were good, not authentic, but still very good. I appreciated the density even though it isn't how I have always known them to be."
1,"This place has been here forever! If you want military surplus, camping supplies, uniforms and footwear (boots etc.). This is the place for you."
1,"I am not a huge fan of going out to the movies, but we all know that some movies are just so much better on the monster screen. I love taking the family to this, the seats are comfortable, its rarely super crowded (but I dont go at \""peak times\"") and the food is decent. The food I would put akin to chilli's or red robin and the prices are around the same. The drinks are a touch pricier but not completely out there for Scottsdale."
1,"We went to Kaya last Saturday for a late dinner.  I set up our reservations online and being a Saturday 8:45 was the earliest unless we wanted to eat with the early birds at 5pm.  I really like the convenience of scheduling reservations online.  When we arrived at the restaurant it wasn't overly busy.  There were a few open tables and a few open spots at the bar.  The Pens game was on, but the one TV I saw was too far away from the table to see.  That's ok, I was really looking forward to this place so concentrating on my meal seemed to trump my attention to the game...  \n\nWell I knew already I wanted to try the wings, and they didn't disappoint.  I absolutely loved the cilantro sauce they were served with. It really heightened the wings to a more sophisticated flavor.  I wanted to ask for extra sauce but we actually ended up finishing them before our waitress returned.  Recommend the wings.  Now as far as the entr\u00e9e went I really, really wanted to get the fish tacos.  I love a good fish taco and everyone talks highly of Kaya's so I was sure I couldn't go wrong.  However, my H talked me out of getting the tacos and trying something \""new.\""  As he put it \""you know what fish tacos are like, try something else.\""  So I did, and I can confidently say I was really, really disappointed to say the least.  I got the tropical Paella that had chicken, chorizo, mussels, scallops, shrimp, some pineapple flavor with peas and crushed red pepper.  Ugh I thought this would be delicious considering I am a seafood junkie and it just missed the mark completely.  The chicken and chorizo were totally overcooked and the rice resembled the flavor and texture of Rice A Roni, yes it was that bad and bland.  I found no scallops and there was no sauce to the dish to soak the mussels in meaning dry, dry, dry.  The only part of it that was tasty was the shrimp.  I am guessing they cook up the paella in advance for dinner then reheat it and add fresh shrimp?  Well that was how it tasted... So get this, my H who talked me out of ordering the fish tacos, ordered them for himself, a move I was not anticipating.  A few bites into my dinner and I just said to him, I really don't like this at all.  He offered to swap dinners with me so I had almost 2 whole tacos, and yes folks they were delicious, and way to take one for the team dear!  I knew I should have just went with my gut and got the tacos from the get go.  As for the rest of the Paella he did eat it but grudgingly and had the same opinions about it as I had, not good and definitely not worth $24.00.  \n\nSo cool place, good drinks, pleasant atmosphere, attentive servers, but I would never recommend the Paella.  The fish tacos, YES, the paella, NO..."
0,"Okay so I have put off writing this review in the hopes that someone would have contacted me/returned my calls but since that has not happened except to notify me they were canceling my pre-scheduled appt I decided it was overdue. I am SO DISAPPOINTED because I really wanted to love this place like everyone else \nLet me explain....I will try to be as breif as possible. \nI have longer brown hair with long layers.\nIt was time for a haircut and color so I did a little research and decided to go to Snapdragon based on the amazing reviews here on Yelp. I was so excited. I show up to my appt with a few pintrest pics of hair I liked. (admittedly 15 min late)\nThe consultation:\nI wanted dark purple hair. Showed the pics. I was told they do not do un natural hair color. She quickly advised she refer me elsewhere. She looked at my hair and asked me some questions. Recommended AGAINST red hair because of the high maintenance cost. Then quickly recommended a better look for me. She found pictures (added below) and showed me dark hair with chunky ombre bronze highlights. Super cute. *HER IDEA* \nSo the plan with my hair was to have dark hair with copper ombre highlights. My hair was already dark so bleach ends, then apply copper to ends for an ombre look. \nNever at any point was anything said to me about there being any issues with processing.\nOnce my hair was done and dry and I finally looked I was shocked! I had RED HAIR! No OMBRE AND barely noticable highlights!  I was in shock! \nI did not like it. It was NOTHING even close to what the stylist showed me. It was nothing like I expected or wanted. I held in my tears... \nI went to pay and $300!! \nI was charged extra for Ombre process. What ombre?\nI was so upset I discussed my dissatisfaction with the receptionist and left. \nI thought I would go home and maybe it would grow on me. Well the next day I was even more upset. \nAs if all that was not bad enough. ..THE WORST PART WAS HOW THEY HANDLED THE SITUATION.  \nBasically I was passed around between several different stylists. One in particular was incredibly rude. After emailing several pictures I was basically ganged up on and told I got what I was promised and my hair looked just like the pics and I was just 'unhappy' I was offered a Malibu treatment service to remove RUST. ??? WHAT??\nThey offered me ONE APPT TIME on a wed morning and when I told them I work and could not make a 9am wed appt they just said okay and I never heard from them again until my next scheduled appt that I made while I was there. They called me the day before and just said \""we know you were not happy with your hair last time so we are canceling your appt\""\n HOW RUDE !!!! WHO DOES THAT?\nObviously there was a LOT more details I could have disclosed like when they know they messed up all the stylists will gather around and 'gang up' on the client and say oh your hair looks so good! And crap like that patronizing comments to convince you they did not mess up.  \nOverall I felt very bullied. I was over-charged for services I did not receive plain and simple. I was NOT satisfied and instead of admitting they messed up or AT LEAST understanding that I was not happy and offering a partial refund or offering to fix it I was treated like I was the problem and they did nothing wrong. \nI think this salon has potential to be good if they get it right the first time. But when they mess up they certainly do NOT know how to treat their customers.  I am giving 2 stars because the receptionist was so super nice and completely professional.  \n\nI deserve a refund. \n\nI am posting the pics. You be the judge\nMy before; \nThe stylists SUGGESTED style;\nand My after.\nNotice how 'my after' has ABSOLUTELY NO OMBRE\nNo copper and worst of all...RED!"
0,"More soggy Rolled Tacos - five of them for $4 bucks. Slightly crispy on edges, but a mushy mess in the middle. This was through the drive-through at about 11pm. These were not good, but they are the kind of item you eat anyway if not good and regret it later. Will probably order a Burro here next time, since thats the name of the place, but they should know how to properly deep fry a rolled taco. Decent red sauce is available also."
0,"Sooooo.. you want me to pay HOW MUCH? To just walk on glass above the Grand Canyon?!? Sooo.. the place is FULL OF TOURISTS .. I noticed there are a lot of people from China and India.. I guess its part of their tour when they come to Nevada. But anyhoo.. packages are expensive and not really worth the long drive from Las Vegas. When you get there the lines are super long just getting to the skywalk, they make you wear those scrub shoes so you don't scratch the surface on the glass, and you walk literally on a small glass walkway where you get to take pictures by the photographers out there. THey make you do CRAZY poses like \""superman\"" or pretend that you are falling off the clifff.. just really really corny poses.... and if you are scared of heights, may not worth it for you to walk on it cause you can literally see at the very bottom of the Grand Canyon. After your \""photoshoot,\""   they make you head downstairs where all the pictures are developed and try to con you to pay more money to pay for the pictures you took at the skywalk. I felt like the whole place just try to make you spend money.. from food to tickets to photography.. you would think you are losing money from the casinos in las vegas, but forget that! Just come to the skywalk and you will lose more money! However, despite everything, the view of the Grand Canyon is quite remarkable! Absolutely gorgeous but didnt think the whole skywalk thing was thAt amazing..  (:\n\n*FYI: Tourists are not allowed to bring their own cameras on the skywalk. They make you put your bags and camera in a locker room before you are allowed onto the skywalk."
1,"Just got an acrylic gel manicure from Gina and I am very happy with it. I usually go to Highland Nails because it's right around the corner, but wanted to try a new place because my last gel pedicure was far below par. Usually nervous to try new places but I'm glad I did. Gina listened to what I asked for and accommodated my different requests as we went along. I don't get many manicures (because unfortunately I have pretty un-pretty hands :-/ ) but I think now I may have to get more! Very friendly lady at the front desk and extremely nice facility. I hope all my future experiences here are just as good as today! :)"
1,"Oh my, what a great absolute Five Star experience! \n\nI came here with a friend and took the long tour (90 mins plus). Our guide was a retired architect here in the Valley who clearly loved his previous job but really loves the opportunity to give back to others the effect that Frank Lloyd Wright had on his life and industry. \n\nWOW!"
0,"I went here with 9 other people for Memorial Day weekend.  I've been to the NY one which I absolutely loved and was really excited to know that there's a Serendipity much closer to me now.  First thing I noticed was that they have a window by the side of the building from which you can order to go.  I found it really interesting and convenient that they did that.  Although there were long lines, they seemed to be moving rather quickly.\n\nI have to say though, I was really disappointed by my experience with the Vegas Serendipity.  Their service sucks.  When I went to get a table, they told me the wait would be about an hour.  That's understandable and fine.  After 50 minutes of waiting, my friend suggested that we check to see how far along we were.  We go up to the bitchy hostess and she informed us that they had called us.  But our beeper never rang!  And we were waiting right outside their door the whole time.  Another server then explained to us that some of their beepers were broken and said that they'd clear a table for us immediately.  Which was nice except the extra little comment she had to add which was \""You guys are lucky we'll clear a table for you now\"".  My friend and I just looked at each other astonished.  WTF?!  The beeper issue is not our problem, it's the restaurant's.  They shouldn't be so cheap and use beepers that are broken.\n\nStill, we didn't let that damper our mood.  We went on our merry ways and ordered a load of food.  (Their menu, compared to the NY branch, is not as long and may differ a bit)  I shared an omelette with a friend and ordered the Forbidden Broadway Sundae for myself.  \n\nThe omelette was plain but decent.  Nothing worth talking about.  The sweet potatoe fries that came with it were really good but not so much after you take it home as leftovers.  When our waiter was taking down our orders, he had made it a point to ask me whether I had wanted my dessert after or with my entree to which I replied after since I didn't want to the ice cream to melt.  For some reason, my dessert was brought out with my entree.  When I told the guy that brought it out, he proceeded to give me attitude and told me \""Well it's already here.  If I were to bring it back, it'll take another 20 minutes.  But I mean... I could bring it back if you really want.\""  I told him it was ok and he just rushed off.  No apology, no empathy, nothing.  Whatever.  I had a great dessert piled with whip cream that I had asked to be left out.  Oh well.  What could I have done at that point?\n\nOverall, it wasn't worth it.  The food for the most part is mediocre (my friend told me the One-Eyed Jack was bad and that the bread was so hard it was inedible) and the prices are high.  If you want to go just to say you went, then go.  Otherwise, avoid it.  There are a bunch of great buffets (Wynn!) you can hit up in Vegas."
0,Very slick operation...I mean the office.  Changed my mind within two business days of paying in full (MANDATORY!!!) and was charged over $1600.00 for nothing more than a blood test.  Was told by Dr. (after signing credit card forms) that most people require two to three additional transplants to be satisfied.  Assistant who tried to take my blood could not do it and Dr. had to take over.  Said she was new and didn't know what she was doing. She said she was doing what she was taught in school.  Embarrassing for her...uncomfortable for me.  Would NEVER go back to this office.  I will go to small claims court to get my money back.
1,"We live by and will definitely do take-out again, although it is a bit more pricey. The chicken curry was SO good that I didn't try anything else!! Pad see-ew is good according to my husband."
0,"Not consistent, left me ill \n\nFor what it's worth I have enjoyed the food I've gotten at Burger Rush. I've been there three times but I won't be returning. The third visit left me with a stomach ache that kept me on the couch or in bed for half the day. This is corroborated by my friend whom I dined with and experienced the same symptoms the next day. (We don't live with one another and that was the only occasion that week when we were together, or ate together) Each visit it seemed as though the food was different, the burgers and the fries, but specifically the fries. (Ranging from soggy, to too much batter, not enough) These three visits to Burger Rush were within the first two months they were open, so I can excuse the inconsistency, but there is no excuse for poor quality food or poorly cooked food that leaves their customers with stomach pains. In addition, I was very disappointed that they didn't have sweet potato tots, which are on the menu but apparently they don't carry them (I've unsuccessfully ordered them three times ha). Service was mediocre, and often took a while to receive your food, specifically for a burger joint with a drive thru. I've waited 20 minutes for two burgers in their drive thru. Overall really disappointed, I live in the neighborhood and have a demand for a burger joint that's open past last call.  On the plus side, after a peek at the other reviews, it doesn't seem as though anyone else has gotten ill from eating at Burger Rush. Could have been isolated, but once is one too many, not taking my chances."
0,"Just overpriced and totally pretentious. Not a very nice looking restaurant except for the art which looked wonderful, i think as they were not lit very well. The food, ok, but ah I am hungry and then I was hungry. I got the fish Hake, 24 dollars no side no nothing some oysters under it which I thought tasted weird and sort of slimy after the nice fish.  I wanted a salad but I quess that another 10 dollars plus for some was a bit high. They came around with a tray of salt choices. then they came with a spoon full of green stuff. Go to Lux Cafe  - much nicer, much more friendly, if you are pretentious and loaded and want to waste your money go to Noca. NO ca again."
1,"Braddah's offerings are similar to Chipotle, yet with Hawaiian twist. If you're a fan of Burrito Bowl at Chipotle, chances are high that you'll like Huli Huli Chicken Rice Bowl here."
1,Agree with other reviews. Sushi and rolls were amazing because the fish is so fresh.  The special dishes that we got were expensive and okay. I would stick with sushi and rolls. Service was okay; I think our waitress was new.
0,"We just got back from a 4 night stay at the Cosmopolitan and I doubt I'll go back.  This hotel fell well short of our expectations.  In short, our room wasn't ready when we arrived, items in our room didn't work, the room had been and continued to be poorly cleaned during our stay, and hotel staff was in general not helpful.\n\nUpon arrival, we were informed that they didn't have any rooms available like we reserved and that they didn't know how long it would be before one would be ready.  They tried to up-sell us to another room for $50/night, but we declined and chose to wait for the room we requested to be cleaned and become available.  They gave us keys and informed us that they would call shortly and let us know what our room number is and that our keys would be automatically activated for that room.  After roughly a 2 hour wait, we received the call that our room was ready, but their system to activate the keys wasn't working so we needed to go back to the front desk to get new keys made.  After getting back to the front desk to get new keys made, another attempt was made by the front desk employee to up-sell us to a different room, this time for $30/night.  Again we declined.  However, we were able to talk them into putting us in a room on a higher floor than what they had originally assigned us to (originally assigned us to a room on the 30th floor and we ended up with a room on the 61st floor).\n\nAt first glance the room was nice, but the longer we stayed there, the more issues we found.  We found an empty beer can in one of the cabinets within the first 30 seconds of entering the room, but yet the maid didn't seem to be able to find it and dispose of it in the 4 days we stayed there.  The mini bar was missing items.  We worried that this would show up on our bill when we checked out.  It did, but the front desk had no issue taking the item off our bill.  The lights in the room can all be controlled via on/off wall switches or via dimming options through the TV.  It's kind of a neat system except it rarely worked.  After our first night, we were never able to control the lights or any of the other features in the room using the TV.  We were also never able to get the TV in the living room area to come on after the first day.  I suspect the 2 issues were related.  The jacuzzi features in the bath tub didn't work at all.  The maid seemed to come every day we were there, but yet I saw no signs that the room was ever vacuumed while we were there.  The iron in the room had a broken knob on it so you couldn't tell what setting it was on or change the setting.  My other issues with the room get pickier from there so I'll stop.  While this all sounds bad, we didn't stress out about it too much as we really didn't spend that much time in the room to begin with.\n\nThe staff at the Cosmopolitan leaves much to be desired as well.  Of the 3 people we had to deal with at the front desk, only 1 was really helpful and pleasant to talk to.  It ended up working out better for us that this didn't happen, but when the front desk called us to tell us our room was ready, they should have also called the bellhop for us to have our bags that we left with them brought up to our room.  Instead, we had to stand in line and deal with the bellhop ourselves.  We rented a car for a day from the Hertz desk inside the hotel.  Upon trying to return the car, no one was working the desk at 11am.  The couple in line in front of us at the Hertz desk waited nearly 35min while hotel staff was dumbfounded as to why someone wasn't working the desk.  We waited about 20min and a couple behind us waited about 10min.  I can't fault the hotel too much for Hertz not doing their job, but the organization and communication among the hotel staff about how to resolve the situation was pathetic.\n\nMy girlfriend had ordered a b-day cake from the hotel to be delivered to the room at a specific time and day to surprise me.  This request was confirmed multiple times and the hotel assured her that the cake would be delivered to the room at the time she request.  But, of course, the cake was in fact not delivered at the time she asked for nor anywhere close to the time she asked for.  We don't actually know when it was delivered because we had to leave to make a dinner reservation.  When we returned to the room much later that evening, the cake was sitting there in the room.  No apology or explanation was ever given as to why the cake wasn't delivered when requested.\n\nWhile there wasn't any one big incident that really made us dislike our stay at the Cosmopolitan, it was the numerous little things that, at the end of our stay, made us look back and wonder if maybe we should have stayed at a different hotel.  I truly expected more from this Hotel.  Do yourself a favor and stay at another hotel."
0,"Really confused about the high star rating here...  I was actually excited for airport food due to the high Yelp reviews.  Should have dialed down my expectations?  I got the teriyaki chicken with brown rice.  The rice and chicken were both really dry.  The veggies were soggy.  \n\nService was great, unlike some other posters, but that did not make up for the food.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?  \n\nPrice was right - under $10 for food with tax."
1,"I walked in expecting to be inundated by salespeople. But no, nothing, I was left alone and browsed in peace. It was soooo nice. \nI am looking to buy a lot of furniture for a house we just bought and this is the place.\nBeautiful furniture and accessories.\nI recommend this place for a peaceful and stress-free shopping experience."
0,"I heard about this restaurant when I was visiting friends in Tucson, Arizona where I dined at El Charro restaurant.  Tucson is the Mexican Food capitol of the United States and one of the best restaurants (and there are many) is El Charro! El Charro has been in business since 1922 and for good reason.  I was so excited to see an article posted on the wall saying they just opened up in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand but under the name of Hechos En Las Vegas! I told my kids, my brothers, my sister and we had a group of 14 people very excited to finally have good Mexican food in Las Vegas.  The servers were very nice and we were excited to tell them that we were originally from Tucson and looking forward to the food.  The first sign that things were not going to taste like El Charro was the chips and salsa.  This was definitely not El Charro's salsa.  It was thick and had a hint of \""tex-mex\"" in the flavor.  Then we got our menu's.  This was definitely not the menu I was expecting.  I had even called the original El Charro in Tucson and asked if it was their recipes and menu... and they told me yes.  Well, it appears to me that the Las Vegas crew thought they knew better than a 92 year old restaurant and they changed everything.  Which is ironic since our waiter told us that he previously worked at another Mexican restaurant in MGM and they closed it down.  Duh!  It probably sucked and yet they had the same crew make a bunch of changes to this Mexican food concept.  Everyone in our party said that their food was very dry.  They hardly put any enchilada sauce on the food. And my enchilada plate had some kind of pickled cole slaw/cabbage thing on it (what?) along with very dry Spanish rice and black beans.  Black beans?  This plate should have had the amazing re-fried beans that you finish eating with chips at the end of your meal because you just can't leave a drop on your plate.  To add insult to injury, our bill was $465! We had very below average Mexican food at 4 start pricing.  The only thing that was good was the guacamole that they made table side. Everything else was a disgrace to the El Charro name - at least they didn't use the real name of the restaurant they were supposedly modeling after!  Unless someone from the real restaurant comes in and changes everything soon, I predict that this restaurant won't last very long."
0,"I'm usually very tolerant of rude wait staff but Tuesday night at Geisha wes nonsesnse\nFirst off our waitress brings out a warm beer and was a bit put out that I asked for a cold one. She said \""oh, we just got these in\"". Oh! So you give it to me?\"" My buddy ordered a shot of $20 shot of Patron Silver and the bartender mixed the shot with ice water. The sushi must have been from the diet menu as portions were tiny. The only saving grace was the fried banana/ ice cream dessert. One star is way too generous for the shitty drinks, shitty attitude of the wait staff and meager portions. You want good sushi, go to Sakana in Mesa or Awatuki. You want to be served over-priced food by rude snobs. . .Paris. . .Geisha A-Go-Go Scottsdale"
0,"Wish I could give 0 stars. Save your time, save your money. This place is so not worth it, go somewhere else. I couldn't leave fast enough. The staff does not care about customer service and they all have piss poor attitudes. The clientele is disgusting and classless at best. This dump does NOT deserve your business!"
1,"I used to go to the very first Brando's on Blue Diamond Road almost 10 years ago. I've also been to the restaurant on Sunset/ Green Valley. On a recent trip back to Las Vegas I visited Brando's and WOW is it ever better than I remember! The atmosphere is always inviting, definitely a local feel but such a great change from the madness of restaurants on the Strip. The staff always welcomes you and makes you feel right at home. I chose Brando's to watch some NFL playoff games and they have so many TV's and the sound is LOUD which I love. I'd totally watch the Superbowl there. The best part is their PIZZA. Chicago style, they even have authentic deep dish. Fresh toppings and REAL mushrooms, not those fake one's most places use. Also the best Philly Cheese steak sandwich!  My drink was never empty and the beer was ice cold!  If you use the gaming machines, you drink for free too. I LOVE this place. WAY better than any chain joint I've found in Vegas. A must see!"
1,"The service is very friendly here. I usually pick up dog food here. The store is not very clean or organized, but again... The service is excellent."
0,"My friend and I were looking for a place to eat, something quick  and fresh. When we pulled up and walked in we immediately heard \""ooh s***...\"" Mumbled from one of the employees from the kitchen. It became very apparent that they were preparing to close, and that we had arrived 5-10 mins before they closed. We immediately felt guilty and asked if we could still order and the male employee response was \""well it's not like I can ask you to leave\"" he then proceeded to tell us what was shut down and what we couldn't order, it was then we decided to leave.  From my experience it is understood that the close time is when they lock the doors and that is when the clean up happens, and you never turn down an opportunity for more business. Overall this was a poor experience and the employees need more customer service training."
0,"I went here looking for coffee - not the house blend - but coffee from Ethiopia, Java, Turkey, the Netherlands, you name it.  I want my real coffee house experience back.  I want to choose the beans, I want to choose the grind and I want to choose the brewing method.  WTF?  Anything else is just a stand-in for Starbucks.  Okay, so the guy playing the guitar didn't ruin my inexpensive panini meal.  All told we walked out after having spent $22.00 on two sandwiches and water.  I have a panini press at home.  Why would I go back?"
1,"Shoes upon shoes. This store seems much larger or has more shoes than the one on Mark in Henderson. I found basically the same shoes, but with a wider selection in each style. \n\nWe hit both stores in the Vegas area today because my mother in law is here and she wanted to be sure to get the best selections since they don't have this type of store in Hawaii. \n\nI didn't find anything today, I am basically looking for navy however, found a lot of black and brown, and boots! She made some purchases and was pleased with the prices. I used my DSW card so got the bonus points! \n\nEven my brother in law bought a pair! There are all kinds of shoes, from the casual tennis shoe, the flat, dress and even the cocktail shoe if your are looking for one. They have brand names at less prices, and if you shop regularly you'll find a real bargain. If you want good shoes, at a decent price this is the best in town."
1,"Great location with shops you can walk to, including Nordstrom Rack, TJ Maxx, Pier 1 Imports, DSW Warehouse and Sprouts Farmers Market. Bed was comfy with soft pillows. Fitness Center had a flexball, dumbbells, and treadmills and elipticals. Breakfast was fresh, made to order omelettes and fruit/breads buffet. DInner menu seemed limited. Halls were quiet, fan in room was loud when it kicked on but room was roomy and very clean with microwave and fridge. Staff is friendly. Used the executive board room, got warm and if you keep door open, you may hear noise from the hall outside. Overall, great experience with fast check out."
1,"I read their reviews and the 4.5 star average immediately intrigued me. It takes a lot to earn a 4.5/5 star average on yelp and it made me wonder, it made me ponder and it made me eager to visit immediately to see what all this burger hype was about. \n\nWhile planning an office hours at Lobby's, I spoke to Lobby several times and listened to him explain the attention he gives to his burgers. The incredibly lean meat, the personal attention to each patty, Lobby's commitment to making the patty's from scratch...it sounded like this was a business that was definitely handled with some tender loving care. \n\nSo the day arrived for me to finally visit Lobby's. The directions indicated that it was in a strip mall. For those of you who might get a little turned around like I do...go towards the grocery store and when you're facing it look to the left and behind you and poof, there's Lobby's! So I walked in and received a friendly welcome from the staff the second my foot entered the store. As I sat there for several hours, I noticed that Lobby and staff treat every customer the same way and each customer gets a personal welcome upon arrival. I also like how they welcome but they don't banter the potential customers to try the food. They let the customer decide for themselves. The decor was retro and cool and I could see the burger and fries being made right in front of me. I glanced at the menu even though I knew that only a burger this visit would do, and I was pleased with the price. Inexpensive. \n\nMoving on to the grand finale, the food. I ordered the cheeseburger and upon the staffer's recommendation, I got it with provolone and kept everything on it, especially Lobby's special sauce. The staffer suggested I take some special sauce on the side for my fries and swore by it so I didn't question the man and said OK! The burger and fries arrived and I immediately knew I was in trouble... the gluttony kind. Nestled on a fresh sesame bun and topped with thick and juicy pickles, lettuce, tomato and the special sauce, the patty was cooked to perfection and just the right size. I took one bite and was in cheeseburger paradise and I didn't even have to go to Hawaii! The burger was juicy, full of taste and the meat was lean. The special sauce. Oh my the special sauce. It's not your typical special burger sauce. There was an ingredient in there that made it just the right amount of sweet and perfect for dipping fries. I guess the lesson here is trust the Lobby's staffer! I tried to guess what the ingredients in the special sauce were but Lobby said that nobody has ever been able to guess. So that's a challenge yelpers. Figure out what's in the special sauce and let me know! The fries were crunchy and delicious, but there were a lot of them so if you go with a friend, you might want to share the fries since the burger will fill you up. \n\nI can't wait to visit Lobby's again and try the Italian Beef sandwich Donald S was raving about. If it's anything like the burger, I know I'll be in heaven. But in the meantime, I'll just have burgerlicious dreams about the tastiness I experienced with Lobby's Burgers. And now I see why they have such a high rating on yelp. Bravo Lobby!"
0,"No, no, no!!!!! Had such high hopes for this place since it was close to home. Why are reviews so high? Their curry is thin and watery and all my dishes literally had no flavor. They are devoid of any taste or spices. Panda Express is disgusting and yet I think I would have had a better experience there. Run people!!!"
1,"Pisa pizza is by far the best pizza you can get in fountain hills. They're lunch specials are great, and they always have friendly service. Whenever I'm in town, this is my me and my moms favorite place to order a pizza, and now they even deliver! If you want great pizza, this place is a gem and a locally owned business as well so support it! I know I will continue to. Keep up the great work guys!"
1,"Very friendly and good service. \nBroth is savory and delicious for both pho and bun bo hue. \nI personally wasn't a big fan of the rice dishes thouhg. (they don't have the meatloaf thingy! wth?)\n\nI think the price is on the expensive side though for a bowl of pho.\n\nOtherwise, great place to eat!"
0,"CSN can apologize until the day I graduate & it would not make up for the nightmare experience I have had with them since December 2010. I enrolled in classes for Summer 2011, only to have my Financial Aid Requirements say \""Reviewed for Eligibility - No\"" for almost 2 months! I dropped classes for Summer 2011 & registered for Fall 2011. My billing for classes on my account says $3,247.50 for \""Non-Resident Tuition\""! Are you kidding me, I have lived in Las Vegas for 10 years. I finally got an email back from Elda Chavez telling me that I listed my residency date as March 5, 2011 on my application. Freaking idiots, residency is established 30 days prior to registration. I also had the flipping bill from Summer 2011 & they do not fraudulently bill me for Non-Resident Tuition. I will just end with this....I have a tour of another college set up for tomorrow! Good Luck to those students who decide to stay @ CSN for your college education. Keep in mind CSN, word of mouth is the best form of advertisement. I will let everyone know!"
1,"Somehow, the husband and I have managed to pass this place like a million times, never even noticing its presence.  This Saturday we decided to give it a go, arriving at about 10:55 to eat some breakfast.  Uh-Oh.  The menu says they don't serve breakfast after 11 and I was about to get really angry because of the lack of food in my belly but our server was super sweet and said breakfast wouldn't be a problem.  YAY!\n\nWe both ordered the breakfast bowls, and I got mine with bacon.  While waiting for our food, the husband and I made plenty of snide remarks about how this had to be better than the Two Hippies Crappy Breakfast Dumb.  Sure enough, it was soooooo much better.  First of all, our food wasn't served in environmentally unfriendly styrofoam.  Second, it was actually in a BOWL!  Imagine that!  I dug my fork in and got a nice helping of potatoes, cheesy goodness, fluffy egg, and delicious bacon.  The bite was simply wonderful.  The potatoes were super crispy on the outside, but soft and fluffy inside.  There were not one, but TWO layers of ooey gooey cheese in that bowl, making an ordinary dish extraordinary.  \n\nNow, don't get me wrong... this is not the world's greatest breakfast, but it is pretty freakin good.  The service was friendly.  The food was fresh, non-greasy, and delicious.  My favorite part of all though, would have to be the no-nonsense diner attitude.  Give it a try!"
0,"Today I stopped in by the East Towne store for some advice on which camera to buy (Canon T2i vs Nikon D90). I spoke with an older gentleman around in his 50's with grey hair who appeared to be the manager. After consulting with him for about 10 minutes, I asked him if they offered financing. He replied no and I responded back saying that it was unfortunate because now I would have to buy it at BestBuy.  He then  suddenly he lost all interest in helping me, looked directly his watch and said, \""Look at the time\"" and placed the camera back on the shelf and locked the glass window while his back was turned to me. I was stunned to see such poor and disrespectful customer service! In my effort to desperately correct the awkward situation, I asked him about their camera bags.  Without an apology or an explanation as to why he's leaving, he said he'll find someone else to assist me. I was the only customer in the store. As he went to the back room to find the other worker, I left the store. To be fair to him, the man was very knowledgeable about cameras and lenses. However, once he knew I would not be able to purchase the camera, I was ignored. Would I go back? ABSOLUTELY NOT because no one deserves to be treated like that.  The west Camera Co. store has more staff working up front and their customer service is much more friendly, so check out that store instead."
1,This place is awesome! Took my daughter to AZ on the Rocks and she really enjoyed it and I decided to sign up for a month package myself.  I've been there about 5 times and every time I am getting better and better and enjoying it even more.\n\nThe employees and other people that are there are really friendly and helpful. Always giving me great tips such as using my legs more as I was always using my upper body and after 2 times climbing was exhausted. Now I can climb 4 times. Looking forward to spending more time on the huge boulders climbing.\n\nWhat I love about AZ on the Rocks is they have 3 auto lines as I have been going there myself. I went with my brother this past week and got to climb with someone else which was really fun too. If you are looking for a different kind of exercise or just want to have some fun definitely check out AZ on the rocks. Very affordable (even the month package was around $60 unlimited).
1,If you can't find anything you like in what appears to be the largest menu in the world....something is wrong with you.\n\nI haven't made it to dessert in the last 5 times I have been here.  I usually get an appetizer and the cajun jambalaya pasta.  There have been a couple of times where I was lead astray and ordered something else but I just ended up regretting it going back to the pasta dish.  \n\nSome of my coworkers eat here everyday.
0,"I'll preface this review by saying this is the first Yelp review I have ever written. I've thought about writing a review before, after a fantastic meal, a so-so gym, etc. etc. but I've never been so compelled as I am right now to give feedback about my experience with this studio. And one more thing - I work in the health industry, in a job that is very much customer service-oriented, and I genuinely am not writing this for the purpose of bashing a well-intended small business. I am also a pretty serious recreational mountain biker (point being, I'm more than comfortable and well versed with the right way to ride a bike). I do hope this review serves as constructive-criticism, which is why I've also emailed the studio this exact feedback. \n\nI had arrived with a half full stainless steel water bottle and asked if there was anywhere I could fill it up. (I try not to drink water of out plastic bottles, for both health and environmental reasons.) I was told by the employee at the front desk that, no, there was not but I could purchase water. Really? I've been to A LOT of fitness centers, from big-box gyms to small boutique-style studios, and I have never NOT been able to fill up a reusable water bottle. (I tried from the bathroom too, but faucet wasn't high enough). \n\nMy primary complaints with the class itself include the following: \n\n-Standing up on the bike the entire 60 min. just doesn't make biomechanical sense. Don't get me wrong, coming in and out of the saddle throughout a spin class can be a great way to add some variety, intensity, and fun to the workout. Standing up though is more quad-dominant and neglects the \""pull\"" movement of the hamstrings compared to sitting. Why would a studio have classes that ONLY has riders standing for every class, all class? Recipe. For. Injury. \n\n-Spin classes are upbeat. The music blasts. It gets loud. I get that, I dig that... that's why I choose to pay to attend one, rather than working out on a stationary bike on my own. The problem was that I couldn't hear a SINGLE word the instructor was saying the ENTIRE class. Perhaps the mic wasn't turned up enough or something but I honestly could not figure out what she was saying, the few times she was saying something. I actually started doing my own intervals about half way through because I was so frustrated. \n\n-Intervals or what? Granted I couldn't hear what the teacher was saying, but from what I gathered we were performing 1 minute intervals with 30 seconds recovery time in between. Intervals are awesome, here's why: you work at a higher intensity during the work time and a lower intensity during the rest time. Your heart rate gets higher for a short term and then recovers and a result, you train all of your body's energy systems, rather than just aerobic. Your resting metabolic rate also stays elevated for much longer after higher intensity intervals. With that said, we weren't doing intervals. The teacher was encouraging riders to only use the recovery time if they needed it. If you don't need recovery time, you're not doing intervals. You NEED recovery time to do intervals, otherwise you're simply working at a steady state the whole time.... which is what the class was.\n\n-Music came to a complete stop between songs. I've taught group exercise classes before. It never goes perfectly, I totally get that. But to completely stop the music between every single song before finding the next one to play? Come on. \n\n-Lack of instruction. When you pay to participate in a group exercise class, spin classes included, you are paying for the instruction of the teacher, the subject-matter expert. Not all teachers have the same style of instruction (which is great), but they all should have SOME form of instruction. On a spin bike, this should include cuing body position on the bike - for example, reminding riders to keep their cores engaged, their shoulders relaxed, arm/hand position, proper breathing,  etc. Cues like these are especially important in order for the rider to get the most out of their workout, but perhaps more importantly, to stay free from injuries on and off a bike. The instructor last night gave absolutely ZERO body position instruction. \n\n-Encouraging riders to sway from side to side on a stationary bike is ridiculous. In fact, it's probably the #1 piece of advice that any responsible exercise professional would warn against. How about teaching the riders how to properly engage their core muscles for functional strength, rather than show them how exert energy through their lower extremities without ANY core stability? \n\nWith all of this said, you will sweat in this class. But just because you leave with a drenched shirt and tired legs doesn't mean that what you're doing to your body is, in the long-run, healthy. This could be a GREAT little spin studio if they took the value of sound instruction a bit more seriously and started teaching the riders who are paying money to come to class how to ride a bike."
0,"Overpriced. Of course. Shitty, inattentive servers? That was a surprise. You might as well just sit down somewhere at a slot machine and you'll get better service than here. Plus then, at least your drink will be a tip only.\n\nWe spent our free drink coupons here and planned on getting a few more rounds to make it up to our server... we ended up just staying for the one. It wasn't even worth the free drink."
1,"One of the best meals I had in Vegas!  I love stir-fry places like this- where you can load a bowl with veggies and choose your meat and sauce.  I just went with white rice, chicken, a ton of veggies, and the spicy sauce.  As with everything in Vegas- the total (with a ridiculous $7 Heineken) came to $20, but it was one of the best meals of my trip.  A decent and pleasantly surprising food court find!  I'm surprised with the low star reviews- what are you people expecting???"
0,"i remember coming here after a night of clubbing at Rumjungle at the Mandalay bay. So that was probably about 4 in the morning. Service was okay, not the best. Especially if they have to serve a bunch of drunk people. i was craving for hooters chicken, was surprised that they serve it here too. Was satisfied with the food, well when your drunk, anything is good to you, haha. Oh yah and this place is open 24 hrs."
0,"Order just a cheese pizza and crazy bread. Waited 20 minutes and they asked what we ordered, they just pulled out the pizza and bread like it has been there for 15 minutes! Didn't even apologize about the wait."
0,"I'm a Vegas junkie and probably go there about 5 times a year..  I've stayed at just about every major hotel on the strip and have had good and bad experiences.  My husband and I actually got married at the Venetian, so I have a soft spot for it.  After a few years, the rooms started to get pretty worn down, so we started staying in the Venezia tower which is fab. I have been looking forward to staying at The Palazzo for quite some time and just stayed there last week.  WOW was I disappointed!  When we were first checking in, they were so disorganized and people were all over the lobby trying to figure out where the line was supposed to be.  A woman finally came over and divided the check in into two different lines- then proceeded to only pull people from 1 line and completely ignored the other.  My sister as well as others stayed in the line trying to get the woman's attention- in vain since she completely ignored them.  It wasn't until I came over after they hadn't moved in 20 minutes (the other line went through MANY people by this time) and forced the lady to start taking people from the ignored line that it started to move.  After we got to the room, the room was freezing cold and the heater wasn't working because nothing was warming that room down.  We called down for an extra blanket, which their response was that we were only getting one since they were fully booked (Uh...that's what we asked for).  They told us to make sure to leave the do not disturb sign off the door so that they could drop it off if we left.  We left to do some sight seeing, came back about 6 hours later...still no blanket.  When I called down to ask about it, the lady practically scolded me for leaving the sign up...uh....we didn't.  She said she would send someone up.  We waited about 45 minutes. I called back down.  Waited another 30 minutes..called back down again.  Someone FINALLY came up.  When I went to the gym the next morning, I chatted with another couple in the elevator who had the opposite problem where their room was blazing hot and their air conditioner wasn't working.  Went down to the Coffee Bean and waited about 20 minutes only to find out that the guy didn't submit my order...and had the WORST attitude about it.  The room was dirty and worn out looking.  There was visible dust and even dirty used false eyelashes on the couch..ewww. When everyone settled in for a nap, I noticed that the person that cleaned the room left an eighth of a roll of toilet paper and no kleenex. I called down and asked if someone could bring up some toilet paper and leave it outside of the room and they said they couldn't and that because of security reasons, nothing could be left outside of rooms.  I pointed out that two doors down was a food cart that was left out for room service to pick up, so yes, things WERE left outside of doors.  She then said she would send someone up.  It was just one bad experience after another... and the only ones that I can immediately recall were the ones that I mentioned...but there were many more...which is really sad!  With all of the hotels trying to one up each other, I can't BELIEVE The horrible service and attitude that I kept getting from everyone at the Palazzo.  One time- yes a fluke...but that many experiences on the same trip?  Can't be a coincidence...  I would NEVER stay there again..."
0,Watch the illegal maids.  They will steal anything.  They are the worst!!
0,"I went here for \""brunch\"" on Sunday.  A few things pissed me off because I absolutely love this place for dinner.\n\n* the patio was almost empty yet they sat us almost on top of another group\n\n* they were completely out of fruit\n\n* coffee is $4 and little mimosas are $8\n\nBecause I love coming here for dinner I expected and was almost ok with being financially raped because the food is very good.  However, I think their brunch is just a half-assed attempt to make money before dinner time.  The \""brunch\"" food was ok although it was nothing special or memorable.  I relate it to Scottsdale hotel room-service fare without the $17 bowl of cereal or $20 bagel.\n\nIf I'm going to have \""brunch\"" aka breakfast and lunch in one meal, I think it should be something substantial.  A buffet perhaps?  I think Caffe Boa should stop using the term \""brunch\"" and start to say \""now we have eggs AND salad all on one menu\""."
1,One of my favorite Salons. Hands down a five star salon experience. I had my hair done and loved the outcome. The place doesn't only dazzle from the inside but it also stands out the minute you walk in. My hair dresser suggested great ideas and made it red carpet ready. I have to say i loved the Pineapple Mimosas they were serving as well.
1,This place is so great. The service is amazing and everyone is so friendly! I can't believe how many more options there are! Many more options here than mens wear house. I was so disappointed at their service and options. We can't wait to use tuxedo junction for our wedding day
0,"I've been here a few times, came back to watch the football games because of the nice setup. I have recommended this place to people before, but NEVER AGAIN! We waited for a family to finish up their meal and asked if lwe can have it after them. Sat at the table then an hour later the Manager asked us to leave the table because we weren't spending 300 dollars minimum. Never have I ever been to a restaurant and have been asked to leave for something like this! Regardless of what we are spending we are locals we live in the area. WE PAY YOUR BILLS! I will NEVER return here recommend this place to anyone. The only reason we came back the other 2 times because of the setup inside. Besides that super over priced Never any drink specials and of course the awful customer service. Cannot believe this place. Terrible."
0,"This is a classic breakfast resto in Montreal, also a tourist stop. I had an egg sandwich on pumpernickel, it came with no sides. The wait is very long and frankly I think L'avenue has much better brunch for its value."
1,"Potentially a good replacement for the now gone Tempe Kyoto Bowl. The food is very good, and is prepared in front of you so you know it hasn't been moldering in a pot for hours in the back. \n\nThe employees upsell a little too much for my taste, but they're new and I think that will stop over time. They also bespeak the healthfulness of the food. (Well really, they talked up the \""healthyness,\"" but that's wrong, food isn't healthy. People are.) This may just be my own personality disorder, but I don't want employees getting that chatty with me when I'm ordering lunch. Stop trying to convince me how good your food is Daniel Webster, just rustle me up a plate and I'll get back to you! Sheesh! \n\nIt certainly doesn't make me feel sluggish like overly fatty food usually does, it has a lot more vegetables in it, I was able to get my Teriyaki Chicken with brown rice, and it is comparably priced to Kyoto Bowl or Samurai Sams.\n\nWhile they just opened, which usually means you can't really trust the Yelp review until they've settled in a bit more, it is part of a chain, so I don't think there will be much of a change. The food is yummy, it doesn't take long, and it isn't terribly expensive for what you get. (My Teriyaki Bowl was $6.80)"
0,"I wish I could give this place no stars!!\n\nThis really isn't the best BBQ in town - I am not sure how it got the name \""Championship BBQ\"" but it is far from being championship and I honestly tell you, if this guy won Memphis in May, the owner must have thought he won it or is just delusional - there are must better places than this at Memphis in May!!\n\nI honestly think Lucille's is much better than this place, it damm close to real Memphis BBQ. I have had real Memphis BBQ many times and there are places back there that blow this place away out of the water by a 100 miles!! It really should be just called Backyard BBQ. If you really want good BBQ and want to splurge a bit and pay a few more dollars for better BBQ, then go to Lucille's or even Famous Dave's - I even think there are some hole in the wall places on the west like CJs that have better BBQ. Overall - not impressed.."
0,Just left. Terrible service. Ordered a beer and 2 waters. Waters came. Waitress never came back. Kept trying to make eye contact with anyone other servers. Nothing. Got up and waves at waitress goodbye. Still nothing. It's not even busy in there.  Blonde waitress. No one resembling a manager around.
1,"Excellent customer service. Attention to detail is second to none.\n\nMy last mechanic was flaky, inconsistent and would often miss things while under the hood.\n\nI feel as though I am treated very fair at this place. I bring all 3 of my vehicles here. They are thorough and get right to it.\n\nI told my family about it; now they all come here."
1,"My kids and I go to both Matt Martin and Randie Wegener .They are  outstanding stylists!!  Their attention to detail and their craftsmanship can not be duplicated. \nFrom the moment you walk into The Parlor's sophisticated surroundings, until the time you walk out the door, you are treated with the utmost respect and courtesy. I HIGHLY recommend this salon!\nThe Parlor is a much needed addition to  Las Vegas, and lucky for us in the North-West, it is right in our backyard!"
1,The cleanest/best Robertos in town
1,"I have eaten at soul food cafe once a week for the last month and a half while working with a TV production company hear in town and WOW, there is nothing on the menu that is not Delicious!!  The Fried Chicken is putting other businesses out of business. That is a Fact!!  It has converted every person in the company.  The Greens are made from Heaven, so good.  Mac and Cheese....Its like I've never tried before, cause OMG.  If You are in Las Vegas and don't go to Soul Food cafe, you will miss out on a bucket list of culinary cuisine, and that will be a shame."
1,"In my quest for the best sushi roll in Charlotte ... Cyros comes very, very close!! I'll break it down by food, service, and ambiance. \n\nLet me just say that my friend Tonya P. was dead on: the Cyros Avante Garde Roll is a wonderfully delightful blast of flavor that's filled with surprises. A likable crunch on the outside that's seasoned with garlic and yet doesn't mask the flavor of the incredibly fresh tuna, Imitation crab, and avocado. The signature Cyros sauce has a kick to hit but just enough to have your craving for more!  Definitely a roll you share!!\n\nIf the Avante Garde Roll was fire, then the Salmon Dragon roll, ironic because of it's name, was like basking in a cool river. It sweeps you away with it's bright and surprising bursts of crisp flavors because of the wasabi aoiloi sauce.  It wasn't spicy, rather it was inviting and was a great refresher to your palette!\n\nOn a side note, I agree with Tonya P ... The soy sauce in the spray bottle is genius!  How many times have you gone to dip your roll only to have dropped it into an abyss of soy sauce, leaving it drunk and tasteless!  The spray on soy sauce is just enough to add another dimension, but not too much that it loses its desired affect. \n\nThe service though was not great. It did take a bit of a long time to get our food and the edamame was cold (je ne sais pas!!). The ambience was just ok.  It's a small restaurant with odd configurations and table arrangements. It's definitely not an Enso as far as service and ambience and the only things stopping me from giving it 5 stars!"
0,"I come regularly with my family. Over all the food is good but they charge for tortilla chips and I have never seen that before. I had the chicken flauta combo, the rice and beans were delicious but the flauta didn't have any favor to it. The guacamole would be better if they didn't add tomatoes to it and just kept it avocado only."
0,"Not nearly as good as good as Big Daddy's, Counter Burger or the Penguin.  But also much cheaper.  No table service for food; outdoor seating on side of four lane road.  Everything feels a bit cheap but it also shows up in terms of value on the menu and drink list."
1,The espressolatto might be the greatest concoction man has ever dreamed up. Espresso and gelato blended together makes me quiver with delight. My personal favorite is peanut butter and chocolate with an extra shot. I only wish they had a location in Tempe near ASU.
1,"Friendly staff, very well stocked, I am happy that they are in this location!"
0,"Totally disappointed!! Ordered the fresh strawberry shake & they used strawberry syrup. When we asked about it they told us - \""oh sorry, we ran out\"".  The banana split had 1/2 of a banana, vanilla soft serve, chocolate & butterscotch syrup. Oh yeah, the were out of strawberries. \n\nPortions are huge but if the order accuracy sucks - what's the use? \n\nStay away until they eliminate the bait & switch!"
0,Just went back this weekend. Not as good as 1st few times. A little bit inconsistent...uh oh..inconsistency kills
1,"sunsplash def. is fun without a doubt, it has wayy more slides \""adult\"" slides than waterworld and big surf, though small wave pool.  \n\nBAD THING: the wave pool sucks, not only is it small, the waves suck! they aren't like consuming waves, they are just waves that moves left and right. l0l. the waves are not like big surf or waterworld.  \n\ntry not to eat there but sometimes you just can't not eat because swimming makes you hungry... if so bring money b/c food there is not cheap and the quality of the food is not good, def. not money worth! then again you can't bring your own food in so your screwed either way to pay.  \n\nthe best slides there i would have to say would be the sidewinder halfpipe and the cauldron.  the cauldron very fun! dropping down into a 360 circle is always fun, then dropping into 9ft of water, gotta know how to swim to get back up!  the halfpipe, man oh man would that give you the thrill of your life, but be prepared to suffer the consequences later of a major whiplash the next day! l0l\n\nanother slide i love is the masterblaster, it's like a roller coaster but with floaties! l0l, but everytime u drop, your butt hits the slide a bit l0l,\n\ni've been to all three water parks, and i would have to say i love sunsplash..\n\nwaterworld and sunsplash both have lazy rivers, where you can just relax floating around\n\nwaterworld and big surf have huge wave pools with actual wave like waves! l0l.\n\nsunsplash has more adult slides to go in whereas waterworld and big surf has limited of slides. \n\nwaterworld has more kiddie slides.\n\noverall, sunsplash is great for fun in the sun!  don't forget the sunscreen! or you'll go home with sunburn!"
1,Great sushi
1,Great environment! All the girls are very nice and give great haircuts!! Brenda was amazing!
1,"Gabi you are so awesome! G- spot pleasure is exactly what this place exemplifies!\n\nLet's start with the basics:\n1. Creamy deliciousness in every bite!\n2. Great service!\n3. Comfortable and relaxing environment!\n4. Open late!\n\nWith these and much more, no one can go wrong or get lost in this G-spot experience! I had the chocolate hazel nut, and I can't wait to come back and try what else they have to offer."
0,"Chipotle is awesome; however this is the single worst location I have ever been to, which is why the rating is so low. I eat at chipotle all the time, but will never ever go back to this location. \n\nFood: The staff (which are quite nice at least) never manage to make a decent taco. For example, everytime I order tacos with salsa, they put a dot in the middle of the taco, and I either have to ask them to correct it, or spread it on the taco myself. They also give maybe 50% of the meat any other Chipotle does. I would think a chain wouldn't vary this much with the amount of food you receive, but obviously that assumption would be wrong. \n\nInterior: Interior is terrible as well. All the tables are so close to each other it is impossible to not be enveloped in other peoples conversations. I often can hear the people sitting at the table next to me louder than the person across from me at my own table. Not because they are so loud, but because the tables are set up so poorly that I'm actually closer to them than the person I'm eating with!! Oh and the seating also holds like 1/10th of the people who come in on the average lunch. You might get lucky, but don't expect to be able to get a table the vast majority of the time at lunch.\n\nParking: Parking is absolutely terrible. The parking lot is tiny tiny tiny, spots are all small (which means very very often people park over the dividing line), and you'll often see people parking down the street in the apartment complex, or at the shopping center beside Chipotle. Horrible planning. \n\nStaff: Can't complain about the staff. Granted, they can't make a decent taco to save their life, but they are always generally polite and nice."
1,"As a recent transplant to the area, I only tried India Oven for the first time 2 weeks ago. Sine then, have been back numerous times.\nThe lunch buffet is only $7.95 and the food is absolutely delicious!\nThe fresh hot naan is brought out to you whenever you want it.\nThere is lamb on the buffet everyday and it is great!\nThere are many vegetarian dishes to choose from and they are terrific!\nThis is my new favorite place for any meal. \nThe food is so great, you will go back to the buffet for more and more. The rice is cooked perfectly and they put out fresh food all throughout lunch. The vegetable pakoras are great. \nSince discovering this new gem in Mesa, I have had lunch there at least 3 times a week. \nThe owner and staff are so friendly. Greeting you as you come in and checking on you throughout your meal. Filling your drink glass and bringing more hot naan.\nWhen they ask how the food is, they really want to know.\nI find myself waking up with the Indian music in my head and wondering, Is it 11 yet? Lunch starts at 11.\nThe food is very flavorful. Indian spices are used perfectly. There is no need for the salt and pepper shaker on the table.\nThe buffet is the best value and the most delicious buffet I have ever had!\nWhen my boyfriend says want to meet for lunch, the only thing I ask is what time, because we WILL ALWAYS know where to go."
1,"Saturday morning and still on the road for another week. It's laundry time. Easy access and Very clean. The nice attendant told me that they also do fluff  and fold for $1.50 a pound. Plenty of machines, wifi, change machine, soap products, TV's, A/C, ceiling fans, carts, folding tables, seating etc. Oh, and if you're a trucker, this place is on the corner and plenty of bobtail parking on the street. I'll be back!"
1,My friend and I just went to sundrops and Loooved it! The place was so cute I would never guess I was actually in a salon. I got the Island Indulgance and it was wonderful.  The scrub was absolutely relaxing. I enjoyed shopping in the front retail area while waiting for my treatment. Such cute stuff.  They have great package deals and reasonable prices. \n\nI wasn't offered something to drink which I would have liked. Other then that it was a wonderful experience and my friend and I will be back for sure.
0,"Service sucks. And the food sucks. Only reason why I am giving 2 stars is because the DJ is sort of good. And I like the horror-theme they got going on inside, the Jason and zombie bride human figures looks pretty cool.\n\nOther than that, this place reminds me of those trashy joints back up in Reno, with art posers all full of themselves inside. They would rather chain smoke than work on their tip, and I regret tipping the bartender before my service was done, especially since she forgot that I prepaid for my second round of drinks and didn't even bother getting started on what I ordered from the menu.\n\nWhen my burger, pasta, and fries finally made it on my table, it was FUCKING COLD! Except the thick fries. It's the same cheap fries that you get from Walmart and throw it into a microwave. The stuff that college kids eat because they are too lazy to cook something real up. \n\nBurger was lukewarm, does not feel fully cooked. Everything on the plate felt and tasted like it was made with a half-assed effort. Like they tossed the entire stuff into the microwave and took 15 minutes to bring it back out. \n\nLike what a previous reviewer said, they are trying to do everything at once, and failing at every aspect of it.\n\nThere are plenty of other places along the Chinatown area where the workers take more pride in their jobs. Here, this place is sort of nasty."
1,"CK is a great place to have around. We been there a bunch of times and never disappointed.\nEvery single day they have drinks special, and some day food special. Like today is Blue Moon Pint $2 C'mon!!! Its great.\nFood is also excellent. Fresh, tasty and sizable. I favor their Special K sandwich - it really is very good. Ask for them to wrap it for you instead on the bun. Good stuff.\nThey have inside and outside areas. Inside has 2 pool tables, bar and bunch of TVs. Outside is a nicely sized patio with a TV or 2. They do not mind if you smoke outside. \nJust a note - parking lot is usually really full and it may take you a bit to find parking. \n\nAll in all CK's is a great place for lunch, dinner, watch a game and/or have a few. \n\n\""I like\""\n\nEugene"
1,OH YES!!\njust dont like getting back into my crappy car after...  =(
1,"If you go to an Italian restaurant and order chicken nuggets, you are bound to be disappointed. And also that is a stupid move. So why would you order Chinese dishes at a Vietnamese restaurant? Stick to the Vietnamese dishes like pho, bun, or banh mi and you won't be disappointed like all those other 1- and 2-star reviewers. They do the Vietnamese classics really well. Pho dac biet and bun bo hue are two of my favorite dishes and they do those well here. Check out their selection of banh mis as well and grab a Thai iced tea. Skip the Chinese fare; Ichiban Szechuan is a better choice for that."
0,"I use to love this theater when it was Rave. But now, not so much. Staff is rude and extremely unorganized. The theater use to be a lot cleaner, but I've got to say, not so much. It's actually kind of gross now.\n\nI do like the 5 dollar Tuesdays, but i think I'll go back to going to Red Rock until they get this theater cleaned up and their staff becomes more organized. Also, would it kill the staff  to pretend they like their job?"
1,"Ordered a German Chocolate cake for my wife's birthday from here. It was one of the best non-homemade (by myself or someone here at home) cakes that I've tasted. It was obviously made by them, so its still a \""homemade\"" cake. Would definitely buy future cakes from them."
1,"Very good lunch spot in Vegas. They have a decent burger, a good lobster roll and great fries and shakes. I've been here quite a few times over the last couple years and never left disappointed."
0,"Banh mi has very little meat. I was mostly eating bread. Because of this I had to order two... And I still didn't get full. The bit of meat that WAS in there was poor quality- mostly fat and ended up giving me a sour stomach. I also ordered an avocado milk shake and it tasted sssoooo bad! No sugar in this shake whatsoever! I told server that I didn't like it and it tasted bad, she ended up exchanging it for strawberry but only after much convincing. The strawberry shake was of poor poor taste as well. I ended up throwing it away- it was that bad. I see everyone raving about their pho. Maybe that's their one and only forte."
0,"yes i do believe in giving a place a second chance, so i went in to layers with my nephew to get him a cookie and i got one. after we finished our cookies i did get a dozen cookies to go, the dozen did cost around 21 bucks so not the cheapest cookies but hay they were good. i do have to say their pastries are good even though their customer service and lunch options bite. i was actually not going to write this review and was going to continue stopping in for pastries but after the rude comment the owner themselves left on my last review i was prompted to make it knows that i will NOT ever set foot in the place again. the fact that they cant take simple criticism and respond to it childish and rudely is very sad. \nthe fact is the place ain't worth a penny you drop at the place. LEARN SOME MANNERS"
1,One of my favorite bars in the country!  Kick ass jukebox and Tim slings drinks with the best of em..  Food is good and the bands ive seen play have all been pretty sweet!  They also have a great beer selection and carry Great Lakes from Cleveland (hell yeah)!  I wish there were more bars like this...
0,"I happened to be in Montreal during a weekend in late August for a bachelor party and had booked this Quality Hotel for the occasion. I did not fair nearly as well as past reviewers though. I ended up paying about $160 per room through Expedia. \n\nCheck in was a breeze and the front desk clerk was friendly and efficient. She was also able to suggest a nearby parking garage (as they were rented out) and restaurants in the area. Unfortunately our rooms were on separate floor and one was on an \""upgraded\"" floor but we could not see much of a difference save a few different pieces of furniture in the hallway and rooms.\n\nThe room itself was kept fairly clean except for a decent size stain on the carpet. The room had a flat screen TV with a fair selection of English and French channels. Also present in the room is a coffee maker. The cabinet/dresser has a door to accommodate a mini fridge but alas no fridge. We were out most of the night and did not return until about 5:00 am at which time it was quiet so I can't comment on the noise isolation. The beds were OK, a bit stiff. One complaint I have is that we had the air conditioner jacked up to full and it was still pretty sticky. Free WiFi was a nice plus.\n\nThe location of the hotel is what makes this place. Being downtown, pretty much everything is walkable which was a big plus for us.\n\nOverall, I'd say we were paying for the location more than anything. The hotel itself and amenities were par or sub-par in most cases."
0,"Unlike other reviewers,we had no trouble finding a parking place. But our big problem was trying to figure out why anyone would want to come here in first place. \n\nDuring recent lunch-hour weekday visit (place was essentially empty except for two guys at bar, a bewildered tourist trying to figure out what was going on and a few employees, one on floor painting signs), you may well feel you have  stumbled into some sort of boho work-in-progress in an old block-long warehouse in charm-free neighborhood south of downtown proper. \n\nCheery young female employee who greeted us tried to explain what the mind-reeling business operation was all about--but it was pretty clear she wasn't very sure herself.  Is it a bar? A  gym? A restaurant? A clothing store? A concert venue? A tax write-off? Take your pick.\n\nWalk into this industrial cavern and you must immediately navigate a weird obstacle course fronted by a boxing ring (a souvenir from a past tenant? who knows? and why put it right in front there when rest of building has plenty of other space?) , followed by a few makeshift kiosks stocked with a smattering of tee shirts, vintage clothing and several faux retro cookbooks. \n\nOn one side of building is a non-operative supposedly soon-to-open soda fountain. . .or so we were told, even though other reviewers have raved about it. On other side  is a bar where we unsuccessfully attempted to order iced tea (probably only place in Phoenix that doesn't serve it) and got dirty look from surly young bartender in the process.\n\nAppeared to be some sort of dining area in open storage yard/garage  to the rear but at this point, who cared? A very bizarre, over-hyped establishment attempting  to fill a merchandising niche that probably doesn't even exist."
0,"this review is in regards to the smoothie/coffee bar only (we all already know how stereotypically yuppie, over-priced and full-of-itself the grocery store part is (and especially the customers; ), though they do have awesome stuff you cant find anywhere else, so i guess they can charge a premium and i will shop here for those specialty/natural items)\n\nanyways . . . the smoothie/coffee bar . . . \n\nin recent purchases, tried some of their iced coffee and a mocha latte. the coffee is terrible. its bitter and has a funky aftertaste. the mocha had so much mocha flavoring it was like drinking syrup but you could still taste the over-brewed, stale coffee! on a positive, they do offer almond milk (which is far superior to soy milk in flavor and consistency) along with a few other alternative milks.\n\non to my smoothie experience . . . terrible. $5 for a small and i had them remake the first one and couldnt even drink the second one. initially, i asked for peanut butter and they put almost a racquetball-size scoop in (thats like 1/3 to 1/2 of the smoothie!). i love peanut butter. but this was so much peanut butter, i had to chew the smoothie and almost needed an epi-pen, even though im not necessarily allergic to pb in \""normal\"" doses. \n\nso i asked them to remake it without pb. but that was after i stood there while the two girls talked (well, one talked, the other just stood there pretending not to notice me) to some lady about who knows what for a few minutes before even acknowledging me. \n\nand on another note, i know \""the kids these days\"" are all into dubstep music . . . but if you are listening to this type of music blasting through some crappy speakers, it sounds like crap! i used to go to parties, albeit back in the day literally before dubstep was created and all we had was some dnb and jungle music, so i can appreciate some good, bowel-shaking bass and electronic music, but you need decent speakers, otherwise it sounds terrible, like the music the workers had blasting through crappy speakers behind the counter. i was about to get anxiety or epilepsy or something from it.\n\nso the next smoothie they made me was undrinkable also, but i didnt feel like returning it. we figured out they must have used some super-under-ripe bananas in it. was it payback? retribution? im sorry i insulted your inability to balance flavors by suggesting that a smoothie half full of peanut butter was not a pleasant culinary experience.\n\nso yeah, i make smoothies almost daily at home and they are far superior, so ill stick to that. its not brain surgery, just act like you give a shit about the food you are making me."
1,"I think this place is now called \""dragonfly teas.\"" But whatever the name, this place is exceptional. Everyone is so nice (even to children) and the tea selection is great. The tea is as good (if not better) than Teavana, but half to a quarter of the price. Be sure to try Lemon Love Affair...  Its Orgasmic!"
1,"There is no better place to take someone who has not had a chance to use military and movie-style weapons. The package plans are awesome. I recommend the \""zombie\"" package - 12 gauge shotgun, fully automatic machine gun and your choice of semi-automatic rifles. The wait can be quite long on weekends so try to schedule during the week."
1,"Good food, nice atmosphere. I really liked the chicken mole enchiladas. The prices are quite reasonable for such as upscale place.  I'd definitely return."
0,"My visit was in October 2006. The line was short. The crowd was not hot, mostly 30 and 40 year olds trying to find their youth through embarrassing measures. Nothing to write home about but something for Yelp.\n\nThe music was awful. The best part of the night was this freaky white lady that was dancing on (not with) my friend. I thought he was money but I think she was married.\n\nDon't go here if you're into scenester spots and you're trying to spot a celebrity.\n\nMaybe I just came on a night that wasn't crackin."
1,Good place for a quick drink.  Met a friend for a quick drink.  Place is nice and relatively large.   Had the jumbo lump crab cake appetizer with a red onion caper sauce that was very good.
1,Awesome pizza and wings! The best pizza in the neighborhood.  The only downside ... its a Green Bay Packer hangout.  LOL
0,"I used to go here every morning for breakfast but no more.  This place has the rudest staff I ever encountered, particularly this one supervisor there who is bossing everyone around.  If you like psychodrama and tension in the morning, this is the place."
0,"Umm no.  Had a groupon and used it with Chirin. She was nice enough but not good job. I asked for cut and all over color ,  well my cut took about 2 min she just trimmed a bit and said I didn't need anymore and my color was incorrect. On top was one color and bottom was another. When I pointed it out she said its our lighting and that it blends and to come back if I didn't like it cuz she didn't have time to fix it even though she was working on another person while I was under the dryer. Not going back. I specifically told her I was going to a wedding so I needed it to look good. I ended up going somewhere else to fix it"
0,"I have to say that I am impressed with the Sushi/Sashimi/Rolls.  That is not why I'm giving them 2 stars.  My wife and I dined there a few times and the sushi was fresh and the service was good.\n\nI am, however, very annoyed at the fact that they advertise takeout and I have called on two occasions and was denied my order.  The first time was last summer and they said that it was too hot outside.  Really?!?!?  I called tonight and they said that they were too busy.  \n\nI strongly suggest that the restaurant inform their customers of the possibility that they will refuse to take an order."
1,"Great breakfast options from healthily to your more traditional style. The in house made granola was tasty and staff very friendly. I went alone and sat right away but it looked like larger groups had to wait a little, I say it's worth it."
1,"Oh God!! The Filet! To die for I tell you!! Get it medium done with a side of potatoes gratin and Mac and cheese! A spread for a true carnivore who likes to indulge.\nI hear the lobster bisque is really good too but I don't like lobster ( I know right!) So if you're into that give it a try. For dessert the chocolate cake is truly decadent.\nThe service is what you'd expect it to be, spotless. Very helpful, informative and nice staff in a welcoming ambiance.\nLast tip- get the pepper sauce on your filet, trust me it just takes it to another level."
0,"this is a total rip off !!!!!!.. first of all , that is not their real address.... they sold me this unlimited package for $2,999  for 3 months and told me that me and my boyfriend can split up the session.  hey what a deal!  we were planning to pay the whole thing but they offered me a payable for 3 months.. i said much better deal.. before i pay, i discuss to them my availability which is tues and wed., they said no problem. okay so they gave this website where you create your username and password. so you can  see and schedule your appointment..no availablity!.\nso i called their one and only employee, to see when i can start the session cause their is no availability for the whole week. , she was nice to accomodate me  so i got 2  30 min session and 2 30 min session for my boyfriend for the first week. the second week i saw an opening for tues and wed and the rest were booked. i booked it and guess what, the owner cancelled my schedule. he said i have to come at least 3 days apart. okay but there is no availability. so i got 1 30 mins. for the week. the following week their is no opening but the days that i work. so i have to drive to their location before i go to work just to do this and now the motivation changes to i paid so much money on this. not good ! i met edward (owner)  heather is right . he sold us this pee test kit for $75 that will tell you what your body need and what is not beneficial for you. then it will sell you the vitamins $75 per set. (you can get the same exact thing at trader joes for $12.99 ) then he sold us his massage package for another $180  4 session and we paid 2 sets of packages. .(this doesnt have any problem with scheduling because we are the only customers ) 2 months later  we notice that this lipo cavitation is a struggle on schedule.! result? none after 8 30 minute session. (the only schedule i can get and if i see an availability and book it edward the owner will cancel my schedule) the reason i am using too much session. what? only go there 1 hour a week. if he didn't cancel the other 30 mins. remember we bought the unlimited package. so we decided to stop going after 2 months and stop paying for the last month so he called me and told me i cannot use the rest of my 3 massage session left (paid off) because  he needs to collect the last month payment for the lipo cavitation that doesnt even have a schedule for me. (no contract by the way). i expect even just a little bit of result for my money. ($1000 a month)  is a lot. i am just an average size person., all i want is to take my belly fat out because that is the hardest part even if you work out and diet, that's the reason why i tried this out. just to let you know he only have 1 employee that do this lipo. this is waste of money, i could have listen to those bad comments before i signed up. i hope this is a help cause this is  fact from a real person !!!!!"
0,"1st let me open with this: I had high hopes for this pizza after reading the reviews. It was ready promptly which kept those hopes alive. But alas, those hopes were quickly dashed after the first bite. Let me follow that opening with this closer: I ordered the pie for my wife and I in an effort to avoid the pain, sorrow and agony of eating the cafeteria food at the hospital where we were after the birth of our child. After the 1st bite though I realized that I had these food items situationally reversed and began eating the cafeteria food...with vigor. I am not sure I can say much more than that. When given the choice between a cold quesadilla and this pizza there were only 2 viable options: eat the cold cafeteria quesadilla or throw away the pizza and eat the box. I went with option 1 as the box had some of the pizza sauce on it and wasn't made from recycled material."
0,"Roast Beef sub was awful!  Meat was well done, not the medium rare advertised on the menu.  Unfortunately I ordered it to go so I couldn't return it.  Tons of employees mulling around behind the counter-you would think they could use one of the people for quality control.  I know this is a new location but I would hope the corporate folks at JJ help this place out-  I have visited many other locations (Tempe and Las Vegas) and the subs are much better there.  \nIt would also be nice if they would standardize and cut the sandwich in half...."
1,"Brooklyn Pizza combines good pizza by the slice with good prices in a convenient location.\n\nI stick with pizza by the slice.  Be sure to check out the glass case to see what's available before you order.  I love the \""foldable\"" crust and like the flavor of the pizza sauce.  The white pizza is a great balance of cheese with garlic.\n\nI love the NY subway map on the floor.  I think it's a fun touch and gives a good nod to the NY style menu.\n\nThe staff are friendly and welcoming and they do a good job of keeping your drinks full.\n\nIt's a family favorite and perfect for a quick inexpensive meal."
1,"Beautiful ambiance, fantastic service, delicious food, and a personal toast from the owner was a great touch!"
1,"I don't say this often, but WOW. This place takes the cake for best sandwich shop in Scottsdale, maybe even in the Phoenix metro area.\n\nI had lunch here and ordered the Ruben (not to be confused with Reuben). The cole slaw on the sandwich was perfect and the homemade condiments made the sandwich a truly exquisite experience. The potato salad side dish was much lighter in taste and fresher than any I have had for some time, although the portion was bit smaller than what I was hoping for.\n\nAt under $10 for a meal, this shop had made its way on my list of regular lunch destinations."
1,"I went there during the opening weekend. The place looks so cute! The desserts tasted delicious and well presented. The edible menu was a nice surprise. Pretty expensive, but what a cool concept. You should definitely try it once though. There's a minimum charge per person; if I remember correctly, it's $12 per person, drinks not included."
1,WOW this place is nice\n\nWhen I hear sleek with killer decor Cosmopolitan will always come to mind\n\nHad a few drinks in one of the bars\nThe chill lounges are nice\nThe Marquee club was bumping\nThe decor is crazy nice \nI love the colors inside & out\nLots of floors w/lots of activities\nLove love love this place
1,"PROS : \nFrozen Hot Chocolate!\nfriendly employees (minus one)\nclean, casual\ngood food\n\n\nCONS : \nhostess at front copped an attitude \ncrowded (make a reservation!)\ntables are close together (make new friends?)\n\n\nOVERALL :\n\nBased on the reviews I was a bit wary of going here, but the Husband and I had a surprisingly good experience. \n\nWe purchased a Groupon and had no problem getting a table even when we showed up 25mins before our selected time. We strolled in a little after 1p on weekday and there wasn't a line.  Now, I'm sure if you wanted to sit outside (in the LV summer heat? you're nuts!) then you'll have a bit of a wait, but that's to be expected. One negative was the hostess who seated us, she didn't greet us nor said much. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and chock it up to her having an off day.\n\nOn a better note, our server was awesome! He was friendly and attentive. He even told us how they made the grilled cheese sandwich, ha. He was also on top of everything, refiling our drinks, making sure we got our Groupon and Total Rewards credit/discounts. No issues here.\n\nFood was good (we loved the fries!). It wasn't amazing, but it was good. We saved room for the Frozen Hot Chocolate because every table was getting one or two. It was good and the regular size is more than enough for two people to share. \n\nVerdict? Yum! Sure this place may be a bit overrated, but so what? If you haven't been before, you should experience/try it at least once.  We enjoyed ourselves and would definitely come back."
1,"Ive lived in Vegas for 4 years now, Drais is pretty much the best option if you're looking to party all night into the morning. \n\nI get pretty drained but its definitely fun. Theres a couple other after-hours spots but the girls here are hotter lol"
1,"-Pretty good pizza.\n\n-I think I paid just under $3 for a single slice of cheese pizza?\n\n-Cool decor.\n\n-Smell draws you in from the street.\n\n-Cashier was friendly (and kept looking at the\""tip\"" cup next to the register)."
1,"OT has become somewhat of a tradition for my leaving town breakfast (I go to the area 7 or 8 times a year on business and usually leave for CA in the am).\n\nUsually great coffee, alway great bacon and pancakes!  Overall really good quality food and service.  Really interesting take on bearkfast dishes - if you feel the need for something a little different... \n\nThe decor is bright and cheery, so it's a great way to prepare for the travel ahead."
0,"I just moved to Vegas and right as I got here my brakes wore out. Sears Auto wasn't too far away and I've had great experiences with them in the past (in CA & IA) so I decided to take my business there. As soon as I walked inside I realized there was no order to how customers were helped. It was just a bunch of us standing around waiting. There were 3 kiosks, only one of which was helping customers. The employee who was helping customers was not only rude and short to everyone, but he was also taking phone calls in the middle of assisting customers (he was rude to the customers on the phone as well). About 20 minutes later I'm next in \""line\"" and customers are walking in to pick up their cars/pay and he is making me step back in line so that they can go first. Eventually more \""paying customers\"" show up and I'm 4th in line again. I decided to leave and go to Firestone (who did a phenomenal job, gave them a 5 star review). As much as I love Sears I will never give them my business again."
0,RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE. \nhuge portions but you cannot split them without being charged the price of a meal.
1,Nice little shop to stop and get fueled.  The iced coffee hit the spot.  We were in unknown territory on the way out of Vegas when we spotted this place.  We were happy to find it.
1,"I have tried almost all Indian buffets around Charlotte now. There are only two places that I like(out of about 7 that I tried). The best thing about spice cafe is the diversity of the menu. I see Indian restaurants in us( I have been to a couple of states) the menus are mostly oriented to north Indian cuisine.  Trust me Indian cuisine is lot more diverse. Have u tried Andhra chicken curry with white rice , dont be scared by its spice level by looking at it, mix it with enough rice, have u tried Chennai mutton kolambu with rice!!!! (My fav) . Have you tried South Indian style Okra fry. Oh in Summer dont forget to try the \""More(butter-milk) kolambu\"" the best body coolant. \n\nI will repeat again.\nBut I guess entr\u00e9e are bit pricey here compared to other indian restaurants and I do believe the .\nIf you want to try an authentic taste of diverse indian( & close to authentic for few dishes) then do visit this place. \n\nMy next review will be the jaipur indian restaurant. I equally like jaipur."
0,"Worst customer service. I could swear that the employee that took our order through the drive thru had just woken up to take our order on a Sunday at 9:30 am. We pulled up to the window, waited three minutes at the window without being greeted or acknowledged so we just drove off and tried  Tamales Guadalajara for the first time (it was so yummy!) Definitely won't be coming to this location again."
1,"A recent Brunch on the patio at Cornerstone was lovely. Weather permitting, I recommend you try the same. This was the occasion when I discovered the miracle that is \""Monkey bread,\"" - banana bread turned into the most delicious french toast in the universe.  Our group ordered and shared the Bagpipe Hash and Greek Omelet as well, but Monkey Bread was the clear favorite. We were also very impressed by a flatbread appetizer special of the day. The flatbread was topped with goat cheese, smoked salmon, roasted cherry tomatoes and arugula. Our service was friendly and prompt and the bill was reasonable given the high quality of the food. The next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'm definitely planning to make a return visit."
1,"Super accommodations for the price.  Excellent front desk, housekeeping, and continental breakfast personnel.  First thing I noticed when I pulled up other than the SAFETY VIBE--was the cleanliness and FRESH SMELL when I walked into the Christmas themed lobby.  :-)  Not sure about the folks 'yelping'  about the building being a wreck.  I scouted the overall building both interior upon arrival and exterior while walking my dogs at 930 p.m.--  The rooms are updated, immaculate, and contemporary.  Chuck checked me in at the front desk and gave me a ground floor room automatically since he noticed in my online check in I was traveling with my fur kids.  I travelled alone with my two dogs and slept soundly, even though I was near an exit door (which i preferred--as to not disturb guests with my dogs) and right next to the gym.  I figured after the first night if noise became a problem, I could switch rooms.  The breakfast area was well stocked, clean, and maintained. Perhaps the yellow reviews are for another La Quinta location in Vegas?  This one is CERTAINLY getting REVISITED  & already REFERRED by us.  NOTE to Dog owners/guests here:  PLEASE PICK UP AFTER YOUR DOGS.  i noticed people being inconsiderate and leaving their 'dog trace' out on the lawn, parking lot, and near parked vehicles.  We all don't like stepping in it--and this is a reason why many hotels change their pet policy.  Please Please Please do not ruin it for the respectful and mindful dog owners like us.  La Quinta provides poop bags for YOU!  They have enough to do and it is NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY to scoop up after your dogs!!!  If YOUR DOG is unable to acclimate to traveling, sleeping in hotel rooms, or barkers, LEAVE THEM AT HOME with a trusted dog care pro.  Also, don't let your dogs yap--and please, DO NOT leave your dogs unattended and go play the slots or watch a show.  I heard a dog lightly yapping within minutes of settling in--it wasn't bad but i had to nip it in the butt asap--and Chuck at the front desk took care of it immediately.  Yapping stopped within a minute after i called.  Thanks Chuck!  Oh-- and HAVE CLASS & leave at least a 5-10 dollar tip in your room for housekeeping-- better yet, hand it to them & THANK THEM personally. Whether or not you have pets."
0,"Worst food of my life! I have never written a review on a restaurant, regardless how disappointed I was. However, I am writing this as more of a forewarning than a review. My order: Half a slab of ribs, fried chicken, mac n cheese, and baked beans. My experience, and thoughts of each dish: The ribs: very bland, tough, and no bones. The BBQ sauce my guess would be straight our of a jar of BBQ sauce from the .99 cent store with no additions in flavor being added. I'm not sure where the bones went, as I would give them to my dog, but I guess they remove them for whatever reason. The chicken: absolutely the worst chicken of my life. The chicken tasted liked it was fried in old used grease. Possibly a grease that had been burned at one point and then reused several more times. The chicken was very greasy and was not edible. Literally all of the chicken was thrown in the trash. The mac n cheese: well, it's good but not great and not original. I have eaten enough frozen mac n cheese in my life to know from the very first bite, that it was a mac n cheese that you could buy like Stouffers in the frozen food aisle at the store. The baked beans: okay, now this was a joke. First off, they weren't baked beans, they had a very bland and familiar childhood taste. My guess is that these beans are straight out of a can of pork and beans. Again, they didn't even try to amp up the taste profile. It was like opening a can of pork and beans and eating it out of the can. I actually used my groupon which because I was a new customer I got $10 dollars off, leaving this meal to cost me $7.10, however, even with the special price I overpaid for this food. Now that's just my food review, if we went into the cleanliness of the place, this would go on forever. So, I am not going to do that. Honeslty, I am surprised they are still open, which I guess actually have a few people employed in this economy is the only positive thought I would have about this restaurant. I am giving this place a 1 star rating only because I have to. Save yourself the time, and money, and the ultimate disappointment, as because of the food taste and quality, I forsee this place not lasting to much longer."
0,It's the ghetto version of pei Wei.  It's really cheap but nothing to be excited .\nI had higher expectation because the owner  also ones Saigon in chandler.  \nI wish the food is more authentic like Saigon.
0,"This is really about a New Years Eve experience, and lack of organization. There are dozens of high end Steakhouses to choose from in Las Vegas, but most serve a set menu on NYE. I had called ahead to see if the entire menu was available at Gallagers I was assured it was, so that's were I chose to eat. have often eaten at the one in NYC on NYE and it was great.  I made a reservation for 7:15. We weren't seated until 7:45. Then were told we had to choose from a limited menu- and no substitutions on sides. And each steak came with something different. I was told by the manager that we had been given wrong information. We should have left then, but it was getting late and we had tickets to a show.. Then the food took 50 minutes to arrive!! We had to rush through a very expensive meal, and asked for the check before we were even done. Everyone in the restaurant was very upset as they were dealing with the same issues. The food finally arrived, and it was very good, but overall such a bad experience I don't think I will come back. We have often eaten at the restaurant in NYC on NYE, and it was very organized and delicious. This place was chaos. It's probably fine on regular evenings, but this was a very disappointing dining experience."
0,"Endless phone spamming....they just won't stop calling my phone.  Really, if they would focus on being reputable, I bet they would make more money and actually be able to retire, rather than scamming people.  \n\nLegal fee's may get these guys in a few years.  : )"
0,"When you think of Gordon Ramsay's reputation, you think of culinary excellence. This place delivered anything but. The food is horrifically bad. Of the 4 dishes, the food was bland, dried, cold (when it should have been hot) and beyond disappointing. The wait staff must have been trained by the Renaissance Festival circa 1980. Since when does a person go out to spend $30 a plate and be treated like they're wasting a servers time and beneath them? Here's a bit of advice, you can talk to me like Gordon Ramsay when you're writing my paycheck. But if I'm the one potentially giving you yours, don't give me any lip and don't act like an ass. To Gordon's Ramsay Pub and Grill staff: Piss off all of you!"
1,I think it's Simi herself who knows everyone.  As someone who constantly works and trains others I always want to give them the example of the customer service you always get here.  They are so personal and never pushy.  Even if you get a to-go order that's not ready yet they insist to give you water because it's hot out.  \n\nFood is great!  Pho is one of the best and if not THE best in the East Valley.
0,"Well a one star from my experience here. This review is just for the grooming. I've been in different petsmart branches to get my bulldog groomed in Utah. I never had a problem with them and I was pretty happy with their service. Got everything done and even gives my dog a little scarf after the grooming. However, this petsmart is quite the opposite. I dropped off my bulldog and left him there for 3 hours. I requested for basic bath and nails clipped. I came back to pick him up and noticed that there wasnt a little scarf, and my dog smelled the same and they didn't get to clip his nails either. He didn't smell bad but I guess they bathed him. They told me about my dog's head bleeding because he tripped and hit his head on the floor or something. Obviously a lie and it was a wound on top of his head, right above his eye. And they Reffered me to their petsmart clinic right across the registers that I would probably pay hundreds more... I just let it slide this time since I can clean up the wound myself and patch him up. Paid them 25$ and left... Probably never come back, but I would like to give others my experience about this place."
0,"They have one of my favorite phos in the city - i especially like the use of grilled chicken thigh.\n\nUnfortunately, last night I saw cockroaches on the floor and lost my appetite. I will never return"
0,Literally the worst pizza I have ever had. The crust was hard and chewy and the toppings just slid right off and were pretty bland. Very disappointing.
1,"Went here close to a month ago and just getting around to posting a review. We've tried several other restaurants at the Cosmo and have become fans of the resort and it's food offerings. The experience started off not so great, with the hostess service a bit frenzied and disorganized. There was no one at the hostess area and a bunch of us milling by the entrance not sure what was going on. Once seated, everything changed. The server was awesome...cheerful, knowledgeable and attentive. The service seemed a bit rushed at times. We ordered six different things and the time in between servings was sometimes not enough. I have no problem with the portions, which are on the small side and for the most part really aren't suitable for sharing unless you order a bunch of things.   I'm always about quality and not quantity, and the quality was excellent. These dishes, sauces, etc. aren't just slapped together. They are creative, complex and well executed. The prices for small plates is high, but again, Cosmo on the Strip, what do you expect.  Now for the food: \n\nVegetable spring roll - delicious, but nothing really set it apart from all the other good spring rolls. \n\nDan Dan Mian - wheat noodles in a spicy pork sauce. OMG. It's been a month and I still can't stop thinking about it. \n\n20 vegetable fried rice. The price will blow you away, but have to say we really enjoyed it. The time and effort that goes into this dish is incredible and you can literally identify all 20 vegetables finely chopped in perfect proportions. \n\nCarnitas taco - awesome. The spicy verde cruda sauce...I asked for a side dish of it and almost drank it. \n\nPancita al pastor. Had never tried pork belly, and the combination with pineapple was intriguing. Good, but not my favorite. \n\nQueso Fundido - outstanding, with a nice slightly burnt top to the cheese, perfect texture and great tortillas.\n\nThe beer was cold but could have been colder.\n\nWill definitely be back."
1,"You can get anything and everything you can get from Costco in behemoth size.  I usually wouldn't write about a chain, but this Costco has to be one of the better organized and there are an abundant amount of workers to help you out.  Be prepared to spend at least $100.  You think you only need a few things, but you keep adding up more.  On this particular occasion for whatever reason, I spent more than $400.  I was definitely packing it in for the winter hibernation.  Lastly, they have their food court indoors, which is essential considering your food or icre cream would wither away in the 110 degree heat."
1,"I stayed at The Palazzo for my birthday and loved every aspect of it. \n\nThey upgraded my room to a top floor suite without me even mentioning my birthday, I wasn't expecting any type of upgrade and was really impressed with how proactive they were with their service. The view from my suite was incredible, the entire Strip is there for the taking. \n\nThe suites here are excellent, definitely a step up from the Venetian. The bed in my suite was insanely comfortable, if it wasn't in Vegas you would never want to leave it. The sunken living room is a great place to pre-party before you hit the strip, and you can always crash on the wrap around couch if you have too much to drink. \n\nThe Palazzo is easily one of the best hotels on the Strip."
0,"Slow service, decent food, and problems with debit cards.\n\nI visited Moonshine after watching it featured on TV and hearing decent reviews from friends. I visited early on a weekend and it was fairly empty. I sat and the bar and was greeted quickly and offered a drink. The idea of serving beer in mason jars is creative, but it's just a different kind of glass.\n\nBeing empty, I was expecting quick service when it came to food. College football was on, so I ordered the wings which are on special during football games. It took a good 40 minutes to get my wings and when they arrived they didn't seem fresh. I also ordered the mac and cheese, which was nothing special.\n\nThe place really started to get busy around 1:30pm as the ASU game was about to get started. The place became very busy and I seem to have gotten lost in the mix. It took me at least 20 minutes to get another drink after finishing the first.\n\nDespite my better judgement I ordered the deep fried oreos for dessert and was was grossed out by how greasy they were.\n\nWhen closing out my tab at the bar, I paid with my debit card and left. After moving on to another bar, I was shocked to learn that I had two separate charges from Moonshine on my card. One of the charges was not even mine! It was kind of embarrassing as my card was declined because of the second charge by Moonshine. I called my bank and had to request and advance to cover my bill at the other bar.\n\nI highly doubt I will return to this establishment based upon all that I experience in my first visit. I understand that new places experiencing growing pains as they emerge onto the Mill Ave. scene, but things need to change before I would give this place any higher of a rating."
1,Really good burgers with all the toppings you want for only like $7. And they're pretty big too.\n\nMy only issue is that their fries are great too but they don't do like a side of fries. Their fry orders are huge. \n\nTheir poutine is also good both regular and tex mex. I often get that alone as a meal. The tex mex isn't too spicy either. I've heard mixed things about their ribs. I also have not tried their steaks but they look good and a decent size. \n\nGreat milkshakes too and their drink selection has some variety. Beer too. \n\nDuring lunch hours it's sometimes a super long line upwards of 30 minutes. Kind of annoying when trying to get back to the office quick so you need to be there before 11:30
0,"When our washing machine died, it was back to the land of the laundromats for a couple of weeks.  This was *not* the place to go.  I figured the convenience of having a \""coinless\"" wash would be better than getting the rolls of quarters.  Found out later that I had a card that with $10 left that I couldn't get refunds.  Finally sold it to another customer but at least quarters I can spend elsewhere.\n\nOn top of that were the kids running everywhere (parents?!?) and some lady with six poodles that peed (the poodles, not the lady) all over a laundry cart, if I have to use the laundromat again, it won't be here."
0,"I visited this business twice and had two different meals.  \n\nInitially, I had hear great things about the tacos.  The tortillas, however, are not made fresh.  They are prepackaged and reheated.  I can get that in a grocery store or Chipotle, so instead of tacos, the first meal I had was a mango salad.  It actually tasted excellent, however a large number of the mangos in the salad still had the inedible mango skin on, which seemed to me to be a careless mistake.  The dressing had great flavor and wasn't too heavy.  At $9 without tax or tip, this was a fairly expensive salad.  The portion was also small and I so I left feeling hungry.\n\nThe second meal I had was their hearty beef soup.  The flavors of the soup were initially excellent.  However, as I dug into the bowl, I found several beef bones, as well as a number of pieces of charred/blackened/burned meat.  There was literally a large piece that was probably about a square inch with a 1/4\"" thick burned crust on it.  It just seemed like careless cooking.  At $11 for a bowl that was relatively small, I again was hungry after eating.  The waiter seemed particularly enthusiastic about the beans, and I was still hungry, so I ordered a side.  $2.25 seemed like a high price to pay for a side of beans and it certainly was given how small the side was.  The beans tasted very standard and unoriginal.\n\nThe service I received during both of my meals (from the same tall, lanky waiter) was abysmal.  The restaurant was empty, but the service was slow.  I had to actually ask him for a menu at one of the meals and had to ask to receive water at both meals.  I also found myself having to ask multiple times to receive a water refill.  When my waiter was not at the table, I could hear him loudly conversing with a female cook in back.  They talked about a number of inappropriate things and also argued over which music should be played.  This led to a very eclectic mix of music, including songs that were cut off midway through.  The volume was extremely loud and would occasionally be turned up louder for portions of the song that the staff were apparently particularly fond of.   \n\nOverall, there are some fun flavors going on at this restaurant, but high prices, small portions, careless cooking/preparation, and an incompetent wait staff really ruined it for me.  I live in the neighborhood and there are too many great restaurants that are just steps away  to waste your time and money on this one."
1,"Very tasty!  If you are in the mood for comfort food, this is the place. I enjoyed brunch there a few weeks ago with my mom. We both something sweet with a side of savory meat. I had the Johnnycakes which is like a corn pancake with prickly pear syrup. Mom had the boxty which is apple and potato pancake with mascarpone.  We were full for the entire rest of the day I believe.  So satisfying!  There weren't too many healthy things on the menu, but I don't think that's what we were looking for.  Excellent cappuccino too!"
0,"I've been going to this BK since 2008 off and on. From 2008-2010, it used to be really good the food and customer service was great. Over the years, I noticed as a chain they have gone downhill. Because of the fact, that the food is no longer good, I come here maybe like once a year. Well, when I went in there at the end of July, I order the original chicken sandwich and it was overcooked and burnt. It was not worth eating it because the lettuce was brown as well. I took it back and the manager gave me an attitude and said I was wasting food. How am I wasting food when I paid for it? She did not want to give me my money back and after arguing, they made me a new sandwich. it was still gross and with brown rotten lettuce and a nasty burnt chicken patty. DO not ever go to this Bk as well as any location in general. BK just plainly sucks and this location turned me into not wanting to go there anymore."
1,"So 10 of us girls were flying out to Scottsdale for a bachelorette party.  I needed car service to take our group from the airport to our hotel and then from the hotel back to the airport a couple of days later when everyone was flying back home.  I called some places a few days before our trip and have to say that I picked AZ Elite because (1) Chris is very easy to talk to and (2) gave the best quote for what I needed.\nWhen we got picked up at PHX, Chris was on time, and was very knowledgeable about places we could eat and visit and the Scottsdale nightlife.  (All super helpful things for myself and my group considering we didn't know much of anything about Scottsdale).\nOverall, my experience was fantastic.  I highly recommend AZ Elite to anyone - if I ever make it out of Scottsdale again, I wouldn't go to any other car service company."
1,"My review is specifically related to the bridal department:\n\nI've had the pleasure of ordering a bridesmaids dress through Nordstrom's before with a fabulous experience so I came here to look at bridesmaids dresses for my wedding. I was in LOVE with the Donna Morgan dresses, specifically the candy apple green color for my outside garden wedding. 3 of my girls, my mom and I came in on our Sunday morning appointment and were treated so well. Terri is very accommodating and sweet- she even called me in advance to let me know the Donna Morgan dresses were running a 25% off sale at the time of my appointment! We got the fitting room to our party and loved having the girls try on the dresses. We ended up picking the dress I had my eye on and everyone loves their dress! Dresses came in a WEEK later and were shipped to my girls living out of state in less than a week. Amazing experience, amazing dress and a really good price! Thank you Terri and the Nordstrom's team for making this experience so wonderful!"
0,"Total bait and switch! My cousin and I (both female) were offered wrist bands from numerous people. We finally accepted and were told that we'd have no cover charge and drinks would be free all night. When we got to the entry kiosk, the woman literally cut our wrist bands off and said $20 each cover. After looking at her like she was from Mars and laughing hysterically, we went back down to the hotel bar and got free cocktails the rest of the evening. Listen, I have no problem paying a $20 cover if that means free drinks all night, but don't lie to us. It's insulting."
1,"Went there for our anniversary and had the crackling pork shank with the kraut mashed potatoes- it was flipping divine! Only thing better was the super bomb bartender Jess (yes, I'm naming names) who took such great care of us we ended up eating at the bar.\nPerfect evening- perfect meal."
0,"I went here a few years back for a convention. As part of the package we got to stay in the hotel. It was no deal, but the convenience couldn't be beat.\n\nThere is nothing that really would draw you to this hotel if you weren't here for a convention. The floor with the slots and tables is quite small by Vegas standards. Barely anybody working there either. Barely anybody gambling...guessed they voted with their feet. \n\nThe rooms were okay, nothing too fancy but certainly homely. \n\nMy biggest problem is with the employees. Rude as all hell. I had to study some papers for the next day and decided to sit at a table outside the convention room and I didn't get into 5 minutes of my work before some POS security guard kicked me out. I told him I was just there to read and make notes. He told me he was there to make threats. So offended was I by this retarded attempt at securing the hotel, I went to the front desk to let the first person who tried to help me have all my rage. She apologized and then sent me to another area that was quiet where I could work. I got kicked out of that area by another dumb security figure. Went back to the front desk and then complained a little louder and then she had to radio all the security personal to lay off the idiocy. I then went to another section and then could finally do work. Not without being harassed again by another security guard, by this time I was over it and decided to go back to the room and blow off the work. It did not work out well the next morning because I didn't do it. \n\nI mean, seriously, how much of a security threat is it to have someone in a small corner writing notes and reading lecture slides? I had the vision that perhaps someone with a top hat and cowboy boots was going to come up to me and say, \""Son, if you ain't gonna drink or gamble or bring hoodrats back to your room you best git outta this hoawtel!\"""
0,"So a friend and I decided to try this restaurant because it was convenient (we were staying in the hotel) and because the menu sounded promising. \nWe went for dinner and while the hostess was extremely nice our waiter left a lot to be desired. He didn't seem to be throughly impressed that he had to wait on someone (never smiled, never asked how we were). He took our drink orders, delivered them and then took our food orders. \nI ordered the chicken mushu and my friend ordered the Jean's Long Life Noodles. The food came out and while I was mixing my food together I saw a piece of plastic in my food. Most people would complain about it and send it back but I already knew our waiter could have cared less so I just decided not to eat anymore and pick off my friends dish (which was tasty by the way). Our waiter never came by to see how our food was (no surprise there) and never offered us a dessert menu, he just came by and dropped off the check. \nThe funny part of this story is, when he saw me pull out a bunch of $100 bills he suddenly became extremely friendly towards us. I left a small tip for him (I used to work for tips as a blackjack dealer, so I sometimes feel guilty when I don't leave anything). I wasn't impressed with this place and wouldn't recommend it to people."
0,"Dun-right?  Nope.  I took a car to them for body work and paint.  The car had been blasted with plastic beads and had nearly all the sheet metal work repaired.  They needed to align the panels, prep, paint and polish.  When I picked up the car 8 months later (!), it was clear they had rushed to finish the job.  The car went into storage for a year while I sorted out some life issues.\n\nOne year later I'm getting the restoration back together and upon inspection I find that the paint had taken on a very fine orange peel look, not orange peel per se, but dieback.  We took the car back to Dun-Rite and they said they that the problem was only in the clear coat and they would polish it out.  Picked the car up two weeks later (again, obvious they had waited until the last day) and they hadn't polished it, rather they had resprayed more clear on top of the old, then polished that.  But they had sprayed without cleaning it up properly - now there were water stains, fingerprints, and fisheyes in addition to the dieback.  It was now clear that the clear coat had to be removed to correct the problems but no way was it going back to Dun-Rite.  Fool me twice, shame on me, fool me three times??\n\nI took the car to a different shop who, after careful inspection, stripping one small area Dun-Rite had painted, and consulting with the PPG distributor, concluded that Dun-Rite had used incompatible primer and paint, and the wrinkling was between the primer and color coats.  PPG said Dun-Rite does not purchase their complete line, so who knows what products they are using.  Proof came when we attempted to strip the new clear coat from the fenders and the color coat came right off with it, in strips, accompanied by the powerful smell of unevaporated solvents from the primer/color coat.  After getting over being mad about the thousands we paid Dun-Rite, we had the car taken back to primer and repainted.  It now looks great, no thanks to Dun-Rite.\n\nAnd, to add insult to injury, I had given them 3 used trunk lids, and asked that they use the best of them, in their judgment.  Then they threw the other 2 away without asking if I wanted them back.  Damn things are impossible to find.\n\nDon't do business with these people.  They will polish the surface but the quality of a paint job is underneath.\n\nDun-Rite?  I say Dun-Rong."
1,"If you love the fresh flavors of Greek food, this is the place!\n\nI had a meeting on the northwest side and when deciding where to go to lunch, my business partner and I wanted anything but a chain restaurant. We were then told about the Market Grille, which my business partner had eaten at their other location and said it was great! \n\nShe was right! \n\nWe ordered the combination appetizer platter and the Greek Trio Platter. I wanted to order a soup, however I was afraid it would be too much. Our waitress was kind and brought me two samples of their 5 soups. The pumpkin and cilantro. \nWow both were delicious. If you could call the pumpkin soup light.. this was it. It had the texture of a warm mousse and great flavor of pumpkin and spice. If you like cilantro, the cilantro soup is for you.. Taste like a fresh garden in your mouth. \n\nOur meals came!  Wow, what a lot of food! \n\nThe tabouli was fresh and bursting with all the flavors of parsley, tomatoes & lemon. The falafel was nice and spicy and the hummus was creamy. I have usually had hummus thicker, but this one had great flavor and on the soft warm pita bread it was delicious. The baba ganoush was not the most appealing to the eye, but the flavors were there, another great choice. It also comes with greek salad, which was flavorful and nice that the olives were pitted. \n\nOn the Greek Trio platter, it included mousaka, spanakopita & patitsio. \nAll three were tasty. The mousaka had the great taste of cinammon with the meat. I love the flavors of the meat brought out by the spices. The spanakopita was good, but a little chewy, same with the patitsio. Most likely these dishes are made ahead of time and portioned out and heated up when ordered. Ok, however if they were made fresh daily, their flavors would be even more amazing. \n\nThe portion sizes were great, and the prices were great. \nWhen I'm getting a dish of a family recipe, it's worth the money! We had plenty of food to take home, so dessert was out of the question. \n\nNext time, I will order the pumpkin soup and try one of the many desserts!"
0,"Wow, this place misses, by a loooooong shot.\n\nFood wise, this place should be rated zero stars, but the server was SO nice and did such a great job, I had to bump it up. If I could rate service alone, I would give this place four stars.\n\nHere's the breakdown.\n\nI've been here probably over a dozen times over ten years, and it's pretty much always the same. Ambiance is ok, clean but dated. As others have mentioned, the only thing to order here is fajitas, and I did, preceded by a cheese crisp appetizer, which I read was great on Yelp.\n\nIn short, the simplest stuff at Fajitas is the problem. Their 'salsa' is literally tomato paste and maybe some powdered garlic? It is truly bland and tasteless, remarkably so. It's almost like jr. high cafeteria lady dropouts are making the salsa, it is just a train wreck. I asked our server if they had a hotter (read: flavorful) salsa, and he brought over some hot sauce.\n\nThe fajitas arrived and they were fair. Portions were good and tortillas were fresh-ish. For some reason the fajitas arrived with raw onions and a trace amount of bell peppers. Maybe i'm doing it wrong, but I was accustomed to grilled onions and peppers- and this wasn't that.\n\nThe service was the shining star at this spot. Our server was awesome, very attentive and kind, without being annoying. I took my nephew and nieces out to dinner, and there were tons of extra requests, and the server (Mike?) was just really great- so much so that I tipped 30% and let the manager on duty know they had a rock star working there.\n\nIf this place could just put some effort into the salsa, and a bit more attention to detail, it could be great, but for now I recommend you skip it, and hit up a Mom & Pop spot."
1,"Best dentist ever!!\n\nI had a stretch of maybe five years where I didn't go to the dentist at all. I was pretty anxious about going since it had been quite some time. My first time going to Edgewood Dental, everyone was really nice, respectful, and professional. No one criticized me or made me feel bad that I hadn't gone for awhile. The staff is also very knowledgeable and very open to any questions you have or anything you'd like to discuss with them.\n\nI now have been going twice a year, and it's pleasant experience (never thought I'd say that about the dentist!).  The office is very nice, clean, and modern. There are many nice \""extras\"" such as free beverages (water, etc) in the lobby and I was even offered an iPod to listen to music when I had a filling done. They also have very flexible hours - open pretty early as well as late some evenings.\n\nI will most definitely keep going to Edgewood  Dental as long as I live in this area."
1,"So when I first wakled into MacAlpine's {the restaurant part} I felt like I was walking into the 1955 diner from Back to the Future. Very awesome soda bar, with about every flavor of soda known to man. I quickly ordered a strawberry-banana soda and looked at the menu. For the most part it's a very simple menu, they obviously don't have fryers so the sides are kind of lame {bagged potato chips, really?} but I was not disappointed in the hamburger I got! Mmmmmmm! So delicious! Real cheese, a nice meaty taste and the bun seriously melted in my mouth - dare I say freshly baked? \n\nNow for the dessert! We got the turtle sundae and it was amazing!! The portion size will not disappoint, and the ice cream had the perfect texture and consistency. \n\nReally loved my first visit to MacAlpine's and I will definitely be going back for round two and three and four and..."
1,"I'd probably give this show 3.5 stars, but because of the great value I got through Groupon ($35 per ticket), I bumped it up to 4. \n\n\nThis is essentially the best rock music cover band ever assembled. Well, maybe not. But I haven't seen enough rock cover bands to make that distinction boldly. All I know is that the music was awesome. I play the drums and know a thing or two about musicianship, and these guys (and girl) were killer. I'm a younger guy, so basically all of the songs performed were from before my time, but they're all familiar tunes that will have everyone singing and dancing along. \n\nI especially enjoyed the first hour of the show, when they stuck to the \""story telling\"" format. During the second half, it basically just becomes a medley of 80s rock songs, and the story is put on the back burner. I know they have to please everyone, but I was a little bummed that they abandoned that format. Overall, this show is a great value, and if you are a music fan of any kind, it will be tough to leave disappointed."
1,"5 stars primarily due to our individual server, John Auer. He was personable, friendly, expressed interest in us, and bantered with our kiddos.\n\nFood way above average, he even asked if we wanted an extra appetizer that was made free of charge (spare ribs, yum) We split the duck and enjoyed the tenderness. Great strong drink gulped - mai tai\n\nLove the ambiance & atomosphere. You'd think being next to ASU that if would be filled with a bunch of college kids. Not the case. Good mixture of families, groups, couples ,and even high schoolers out for prom"
1,"I was so excited to try this place. The food was excellent. I had the organic chicken w/ thin green beans. My husband and I split the mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. The chicken was good, a little salty for my liking but very good. The green beans were very tasty. My favorite thing however was the mashed potatoes and the mac n cheese. OMG it was good and as I write this review my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Our server was attentive but a little annoyed when I said I only wanted water to drink and we weren't interested in a appetizer. All in all a good dining experience. I would definitely go back next time I am in Vegas."
1,"great place.  we take all of our personal and business vehicles to these guys and they take good care of us.  Ask for Jeff when you go in, that guy knows what customer service is and how to make raving fans."
0,"I suppose here is where you learn not all Starbucks are created equal?  I had an overpriced extra bold coffee that cost two dollars more than my regular Starbucks.  Maybe they are not even a real Starbucks, just a Starbucks wannabe like the ones in B&N because they did not take Starbucks gift cards.   The staffs here were also somewhat rude and unfriendly."
1,"This is the BEST casino/hotel out of all of them, its totally gorgeous, big,cool and the dealers are fantastic. \n\nFair prices, gorgeous views, easy drive and plenty to do! \n\nI'll always come here for movies,bowling,drinks and fun."
1,"The atmosphere is cozy, yet you can bring a large group and be comfortable. Don't plan on lots of intimate conversation if you're close to the pianos - it does get really loud, but it's so much FUN! Josh Dupont is incredible. The drinks are delicious, the bar service is timely, it's a cost-effective night out (only $5 cover!!! Crazy low-cost!) with real talent, courteous staff all around, and old-fashioned fun as you sing along to tunes you/the crowd requests. Just don't tell them it's your birthday if you don't want to be put front and center (or top and center? - on top of the pianos!) and sung to with an interesting rendition of Happy Birthday. ;) Oh, and I've been to the old location and the new (yes, I liked the old one, but they had to expand) and have been there multiple times."
0,Food is bland! This is the 2nd time here... The worst among the fox concept restaurants. Never coming back. Go North instead!
1,"so we decided to give the latest and greatest buffet on the LV strip a try.  After glamouring recommendations from friends about this joint, we stopped by.\n\nat close to $50 per person, we decided to \""upgrade\"" to the fatty pass (24 hour buffet pass) for ~63 per person.  That way our money is evenly distributed upon the gluttony that was about to ensue over the next 24 hours.  We timed our visit precisely at 9PM, so we can enjoy a second dinner the following night, like a true fatty would.\n\nenough about the caveats and more about the buffet.  if you eat with your eyes first, like me, then your mouth was watering just walking by the buffet to the table.  the decor was eccentrically classy.  the layout was great, the food looked A-MAZE-ZING (hard Z on the third syllable).  kobe beef sliders were yummy.  shrimp cocktail were HUGE, you could sink your teeth into it!\n\nI will definitely be back to this buffet with obesity on my mind and a vengeance on my appetite."
0,"Crappy service! I came in looking to learn about \""Hearts on Fire\"" and it was quite some time before someone offered to help. I asked to see the hearts and arrow phenomenon and was rudely corrected by the tall curly haired woman that \""arrows\"" are a competitor's brand. That might be the other brand's name for the phenomenon, but it still exists, and I wanted to see it. She eventually showed me the hearts through a scope, never flipped the stone so I could see the other side's \""arrows.\"" I told her I was looking to upgrade my diamond for my anniversary and was interested in seeing larger stones in comparison to my diamond. She pulled out a stone that was already in a setting. I told her that it was too similar to my existing stone and asked if I could see a larger stone. I also asked if she would be able to clean my diamond so I could see the difference between my stone and theirs. She refused to clean my ring, and told me to come back when I was closer to buying a diamond! Basically, she wasn't interested in educating or helping me, she was interested in making a sale. You would think they would position themselves to showcase the features of their product, but they appeared totally uninterested. She didn't even give me her card as I left. I will not be returning."
1,"Great food, simple menu. Try the mac & cheese with bacon.\nI hear that they're moving from Homestead to Lawrenceville. This is very sad. Homestead needed them. Lawrenceville does not need them; Lawrenceville has enough good restaurants already."
1,I was a first time customer so I kept it simple. I love their sushi. I had the spicy scallop and spicy tuna roll. They tasted very fresh. The service is great too. Next time I will be more adventurous and they their signature sushi rolls..
0,"Decided to give it a try after reading so many positive reviews. I'm visiting from Vancouver where we have some outstanding Fish n chips places. \nWent to the McGill location on a Saturday afternoon, and the place was almost full.\nGirlfriend and I ordered the Cod and chips each, and the orders came promptly.\nFirstly, the appearance gave and indication on how the taste was going to be. The fish's batter was overcooked and was very dark. The fries were the same, overcooked, and not uniformly cut. \nLike the author of one of the reviews mentioned, it doesn't appear that they flour and egg wash the fish. The batter was slimy on the inside, and frankly put us off.\nThere has to be a better fish n chips place in Montreal?"
0,"Review of bar staff only.  Can't review the cue because the bar staff never asked if I needed a menu.  Then after watching me review the menu I had to borrow from the guy on the barstool next to me, they never asked me if I wanted something to eat.  Yes, I did...."
0,"Very disappointed.  Probably my fault for expecting too much.\n\nBottom-line: They did not pay much attention to the details. They did not do a thorough job. When I pointed out minor details they did not offer to perform the job better, I had to vacuum the seats and floor myself.  I told them I was not satisfied with the job they did on the dash and panel and all they said was sorry, but did not offer to redo the job.   $50 doesn't go very far.\n\nIf you want something done right, do it yourself.\n\n\nI purchased the $49.99 superior interior clean.  Which includes: Scrub clean and condition dash, console, all door panels and door jams.  Remove scuff marks, blow out vents. Water based conditioner and protectant applied. per website. The lady also told me this include full exterior wash include tires and rims, and full interior vacuuming.\n\nWhen they finished, I looked and the floor and seat were still very dirty.  I asked the employee if they had vacuumed. She said yes, but they didn't do a good job. Then she got the vacuum out and did a few passes over the seat and carpet. She asked if that was good -- it wasn't. So I asked her if that was okay if I vacuumed. So I vacuumed the drivers side and the back seats. When I finished that side she asked if it was good. I asked if I could go around and vacuum the other side. She agreed. I should have looked in the trunk because when I got and and did, it looks like I wasn't the only one to forget to vacuum the trunk, that is my bad for not looking.  I felt rushed and dumb to be the only customer vacuuming their own car.\n\nWhen I finished vacuuming, she asked if everything was good. I said I expected a better job on wiping down the dash, console, and panels.  She said sorry and just stared at me. (I have to give her credit, she was very nice, just not proactive in correcting the problems.)  Then she asked if everything was good and I just said good enough because I felt embarrassed to be so nit-picky. So I drove off a little frustrated I had spent $50.\n\nIn their defense, they are probably pushed by management to work as quickly as possible and they are probably doing the best job they can in the least time to keep up with productivity.  Overall, I am not upset or angry, just disappointed because I expected more for a $50 dollar \""Super Interior Clean\"" Detail service."
0,"Its convenient if you live downtown but expensive compared to the other gyms in town (your membership subsidizes daycare and yoga instructions).  \n\nAlso, make sure you read the fine print in their contract - if you try to end your membership, they'll charge your credit card an early termination fee.  \n\nNow I'm at the downtown Anytime Fitness and its a much better deal."
1,"I can't quite make my mind up on whether this should get 3 or 4 stars, but as I'm feeling generous, I decided I'd bump it up to 4. This is because, relative to all the other hideous university buildings, this one's actually one of the better specimens. \n\nNot only does it not make your eyes bleed (like vampires' eyes in True Blood), but it also has a very peaceful 7th floor area where there is a) free coffee and b) a spectacular view of Arthur's Seat with enormous windows that let as much light in as you could possibly want. It's also where all the Philosophy, Language and Psychology geeks hang. And I'm a fan. \n\nI've gone in there before just so that I could sit around and listen to people's interesting conversations. People who knew things about things I could only vaguely grasp.\n\nYes, definitely one of the better buildings Edinburgh University has provided."
1,"Popped in here the other day, for Sonny's 74th.  Great spot to wet your whistle, hang with friends, eat good burgers and all handled by a terrific staff of friendly waitresses.  I didn't stick around too long, as I needed to be in Rocky Point before sunset, for dinner with the family.\n\nWatch out for all those pesky tumbleweeds and dusty roads.\n\nGood times in the desert southwest.  Great times kicking it on the playa."
0,"I was hoping to really like this place as many spots in the area are delish (Le Thai, Park on Fremont) but, I was bummed at how lackluster the food was for the price you pay. \n\nWe usually get sangria when it's on any menu. La Comida's sangria was aight. I felt like it was more ice than sangria tho.\nSecond we got elote. C'mon...how can you ever get that dish really wrong!?! It's corn, mayo, and cheese -- delicious!\nSadly, I forget what my boyfriend and I got but, I know he got the fish and I got half a chicken wrapped in paper...(sorry for the bad description).... His fish was whatevs; and my chicken was good in that it was smoky but, it's not something that I would try again.\nOur dessert of saut\u00e9ed bananas and vanilla ice cream was the star of the show. Something about that ice cream...I think the real vanilla beans!\nwaaaay =)\n\nOverall, we paid almost $70 for this lunch and it was MEH. \nGoing to Tacos El Gordo and/or Mundo should've gotten our money that day."
0,"I have to say that this is the worst restaurant in Las Vegas which is saying something.  There was 6 of us and we all ordered off the dinner menu.  We even complained and the management only offered to give us something else.  What part of \""non-edible\"" didn't the manager understand.  The inability to finish our meals wasn't the last of it.  It was the revenge of Gilley's later that evening and into the next morning.  Some of us had Imodium to help others of us toughed it out.  If you are going to take your chances, don't get anything fried.  All of us who ordered the Country Fried Chicken and Southern Fried Catfish suffered the most.  But hey, it's Las Vegas so maybe take your chances.  You might have better luck."
1,"Vegan donuts; what is this about?... These donuts pass for grade A, top choice donuts. You can't even tell they are \""vegan\"". One of the best donuts I've ever had. and the prices are reasonable ($.75/donut and $.85 for the bigger donuts) Glazed donuts were fresh, airy and mmmm just so good. The others we tried were the chocolate donut, bear claw, and the donut holes. Now, I don't want to leave out the apple burrito. We just had to try that, and let me just say that it was \""off the hook\"" good!!! Remember McDonalds back in the day when they fried their apple pies? There you go! I am definitely going back to Ronalds Donuts when I go back to Vegas."
1,"\""Too much of a good thing can be wonderful!\"" - Mae West\n\nLoosen the belt buckle or better yet break out the sweatpants. Avoid eating any large meals all day, stick to a banana and arrive at the The Bacchannal ready to eat! The line to dinner can be pretty long we waited over half an hour to pay and then another 10-15 minutes to be seated. They took our picture before being seated, I think to compare how bloated and defeated we where at the end. The Bacchannal is really an orgy of tastes and flavors with over 500 dishes. They rotate so many different things that if you went two nights in a row they would mix it up. They have 6 different stations of food. The seafood section is amazing very fresh and amazing crab legs, lobster and corn chowder, a mini clambake basket, a mini crayfish boil basket. For warm crab legs go to the Italian section. \n\nThe Chinese section is also a must. The dim sum was so good but seemed to lack the individual attention like most dim sum locations. \n\nThe last location that is a must is the dessert station. Save room! So many choices, fresh crepes with so many different choices to add to it. Tiramisu shooters, small cheesecakes and carrot cakes. Chocolate dipped strawberry! \n\nThe price for dinner during the week is 50 dollars. Slightly pricey (and what ultimately makes me deduct a star). During the weekend they jack up the price (which is standard in Vegas). \n\nAlso tip your attendant, they are bringing you drinks and taking plates away for you. \n\nEnjoy rolling out of the Bacchannal!"
1,Fast service: Called Vilyan and 15 mins later he was working on my phone at a near by starbucks...took only 20 mins to fix the cracked screen\n\nDef the most affordable place to get your phone fixed (way cheaper than the apple store)\n\nHe was very nice and professional....the phone works great now...i would def recommend him
1,"I made an impromptu trip to the Dior Homme in Las Vegas. I walked in to look and I walked out with a pair of jeans. I have to say that it was only because of the great sales people there. Matthew Hone, was the person that was helping me and he was a great sales rep.\n\nThe store itself is similar to the Dior Homme in Los Angeles. Very small, but it still carries a lot of the lines, and if it didn't then you could get any piece shipped to the store.\n\nAll in all a great buying experience."
1,"Awesome, attentive service!  \n\nOur family of four, plus my parents, met at Fajita's to celebrate my husband's birthday.  I emailed the restaurant a few days prior, to find out what accommodations they could provide, if any, for my mom who has a severe gluten allergy.  I received a prompt response from Mike S, one of the managers, who assured me that they could cook the corn tortillas in an area separate from the flour tortillas.  He told me to ask for a manager upon arrival, and they'd take these extra steps for my mom.\n\nSure enough, the (female) manager working tonight was on top of things, and made sure my mom's food was kept away from items containing flour.  \n\nWe all were very impressed with the quality of both the shrimp and the Cadillac steak fajitas.  Our kids even loved the proteins, and went back for seconds a few times.  The chips and salsa were pretty good as well.   \n\nThe best part of our visit was the attentive service.  Our server was absolutely fantastic--prompt with taking our order, with refills, and with removing our plates afterwards.  She was cheerful, polite and just an absolute pleasure all around."
1,"We had not been to Sweet Tomatoes in awhile and decided to go last weekend and we REALLY enjoyed it!\n\nThe food was great!  Yummy and fresh salads and the soups were outstanding.  I just love the chicken noodle.\n\nI thought that our server could have been a little more attentive.  He was way more interested in doing his side work than helping us with anything but that didn't take away from how good the food was.\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed ourselves."
1,My family and I eat here all the time. I would put this food up against any Thai restaurant in town. Every time we go the food is consistently delicious and the owners and waitresses are very personable and friendly. \n\nGive this place a try you won't regret it. The house noodle dish is fantastic.
0,"If you like drumming on PVC pipes, some mildly amusing mime acts and 3 blue masked men making a mess on stage, this show is for you. I myself can do without comedy acts such as eating a Twinkie (and as if that wasn't disgusting enough), spitting the slimy mess back out through a \""third nipple\"" only to gobble it all back up. Why this is supposed to be funny, I don't know. Some percussion and mime numbers do have some original details and ideas, but the whole thing's never enough to really fill 90 minutes. It's basically just a two-trick-pony show, nothing more. Even my 11-year old daughter said after 45 minutes - \""it's getting a bit boring now...\"" - and we had an outstanding time the night before seeing Terry Fator's incredible (and incredibly funny) ventriloquism act."

1,"It only takes me almost a week to review after an event!  I'm obviously on top of things.\n\nJoined the Yelpers for brunch here last weekend and had a lovely experience.  Loudons is big and bright, with large tables and just enough decorations to give it character.  In front of the order counter is a huge table piled with cakes and scones.  It's both rude and fantastic because you want a bite of everything!  As it was Sunday brunch the place was packed.  When I went up to order the girl told me it would be about 30 minutes for food to arrive, and as I was already quite hungry I asked if I could quickly add a scone to my order.  She said of course and I picked on up on my way back to my table.  Oh this scone!  So fluffy, so tasty.  It really helped tide me over until the food arrived.  And when it did- eggs benny with gammon, so delicious!  The flavour was unbelievable.  Maybe I need to get out more.  Om nom nom.    \n\nI really liked Loudons.  It was the perfect place to catch up with people and chat with new friends.  I can see this place becoming a quick favourite!  And I can't wait to go back and stuff my face with some of those cakes; who am I kidding, all those cakes."
0,"I work downtown and this is a convenient spot to hit for lunch or happy hour. But, I've never liked my experiences here and maybe I just have higher standards but I'd rather go to any number of places for lunch or happy hour. \n\nThe issues start with the fact that Seamus is dirty, dusty, and has terrible food, warm beer and pretty terrible service. I just had lunch again here Friday and we had to wait over an hour for a couple salads and appetizers. It's honestly the worst. \n\nThe place hasn't been upgraded or had any money put into fixing it up in decades- it's just subpar in every way. And every time I see dirt or dust and have to use their rundown bathrooms I can't help but think - if this is how they maintain the areas customers see, what about the place my food is prepared?"
1,"I just love this place so much!  The menu is delicious and has some of the best sushi in Charlotte.  I'm a big fan of getting some prosecco and the chocolate fondu and catching up with friends.  The staff is lovely...nice, funny, and attractive.  I love the fact that you can peruse the racks for a nice bottle of wine for less than you'll find anywhere else...or if you're feeling lazy, the staff can always make a well-informed suggestion.  The music is never too loud, there is always an interesting crowd, and it's a great location.  Perfect for friends, dates, business, whatever. Love press!"
1,"I haven't been here in years and had a friend in town so I thought I'd give brunch a try again. I was very impressed with the meal, especially the special which was a poached egg set inside a roasted tomato, topped with cornbread. The cornbread added an extra dimension that threw that normal poached egg over the top. The tomato and egg, as well as bacon, also came with a side of pimento mac and cheese that was out of this world!! My friend and I also shared the brioche French toast and cheese grits. The French toast tasted like a donut and threw me into a sugar coma that was well worth it. The service was excellent and I will be back soon!!"
1,"I did NOT realize that this was a 18+ show until I picked up and read the fine print on my ticket ...\n\nWARNING: Please skip the show if you have experience the follow symptoms\n\n- Can't tolerate stereotypical racist / sexist jokes\n- Can't accept profanity / vulgar languages\n- Can't handle sexual innuendos\n\nWhat made this show worth the money: 1st - seating, seating, and seating! Unlike some other shows where you are literally sitting 100+ feet away from the actual performance, this is a very intimate setting and pretty much any seats can give you a great view. You can get to witness the incredible acrobatics close up in person. \n\nWhat to expect: Expect audience participation (15%), ridiculously vulgar (or witty) stand-up comedy (35%), acrobatics / gymnastics (35%), and Melody Sweets' musical performance (15%). \n\nYup, this was probably the most vulgar comedy show that I've ever watched (even more so than the Book of Mormon). If you can set your mind free (as one of the Yelper wrote - getting buzzed) and having that  \""I don't give a damn\"" attitude, then this could potentially be one of the best Vegas show experience. \n\nP.S. - Definitely one of the more expensive show - expect at least $100 per ticket."
0,"Very disappointed. Yesterday at 8:50am they scheduled my appointment and said they would call 15 minutes before. Didn't happen. I called two times throughout the day, they said I was still on the schedule. I finally called at 5:45, and told they wouldn't make it, but will tomorrow. I said I needed a morning appointment as I already wasted an entire day. So, they did as newly promised, called and came out before 9am.They quoted $139.95 per hour for a service call, in truth there is a service fee that brings it to $146.45. The plumber was an nice guy, but Larkins policy and the equipment they carry is ridiculous!  So when I called and said I had an outdoor gas leak near my pool/bbq equipment, why would your plumber int the big yellow plumbing truck not have PIPE or A THREADER on their truck?  Oh, because they will charge you $139.95 per hour to get in the truck, drive to the office, cut a pipe, thread the pipe, drive back to your home and install the pipe... REALLY??  Who does that? So a 12 in 1/2 inch pipe repair, depending on traffic both ways, which is 1 miles each way, could cost, what, upwards of $500? Use them if you think any of that makes sense!  I certainly won't!"
0,"Is there less than a one star? WORST cab experiences EVER! I travel extensively for buisness and have never ever encountered such ignorance, incompetence and hostility.\n\nFirst cab driver got horribly lost. He claimed his GPS didn't work. A $50 cab ride turned into a $90 ride! Then, he called me repeatedly (I didn't answer). When I finally did answer, he harassed me on the phone after I was at my hotel to be sure I didn't \""complain\"". Are you kidding me????\n\nRide back to the airport was no better. My client booked the ride and when I got to the cab there was a very mean, harassing phone call from a dispatcher chewing me out for not being on time. My client booked one ride, then cancelled and booked a second for 15 min later. Dispatcher decided to yell at me instead. Lucky I saved the voice mail. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?\n\nWho operates a business this way? What a disturbing and unpleasant experience!\n\nI did try to contact Yellow Cab directly, to speak with them before posting this. But they weren't interested."
1,"From a guy's perspective...\n\nIf you want to get away from the crowd, the noise and the people trying to flick their little cards of adult content on the Strip, Imperial Spa is an awesome retreat.  It's not glamorous or toney like most of your typical casino spas that have fluffy towels, fruit, flavored water and Enya playing in the background but, in so many other ways, you get so much more without having to break the bank.\n\nAlright, so the location is kind of hidden and hard to spot if you're not paying attention.  Okay, it's outright shady and the building kind of looks like they were trying to make it look like the Excalibur but I digress.  Once you check in, pay for your services, get your key, your \""spa pajamas\"" and enter your respective locker room area.  When you get to your locker, strip down and take a freakin shower, regardless if you're going to use the wet area or not, think of it as a courtesy to the other spa patrons who don't want to smell your funk or lingering smell of tobacco from the casinos.\n\nThe wet area, which has a large hot whirlpool tub, a cold plunge, a sauna, steam room and open sitting/standing showers.  It's freakin dude heaven because where else can you chill in a hot tub or take a shower while watching ESPN?  Yup, there's a freakin flat screen tv in the shower area that faces the tub.  Sure, you're watching the game and chillin in your birthday suit, no one gives an eff, it's a Korean spa and it's what they do. \n\nIf you want to check out the coed area, change into your spa pajamas so you can head upstairs to the coed area where they have various sauna-esque rooms, a sitting area with couches and a tv, a theatre, etc.  Of all the rooms, I especially liked the red clay ball room, it was awesome.  I literally could feel every little ball on my body!  They also have a little snack bar near the sitting area.  If you really can't live without technology, you can also bring your laptop if you want to jump on their wifi.\n\nTIP 1:  Before you head to the coed area, bring one of those small towels from the locker room so you have something to rest your head on when you use the rooms.\n\nTIP 2:  In the wet area, alternate between hot and cold, i.e. hot tub, cold plunge, sauna, shower, hot tub, steam room, etc.\n\nTIP 3:   Think of the wet area as the good ol' locker room at the gym.  You need to leave your inhibitions at the door.  If you're uncomfortable with  nudity,  this isn't the place for you.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience.  The facilities were clean, the staff was quite friendly and at least when I went on a Thursday afternoon, it wasn't too busy, which was kind of nice, it felt like I had the entire spot to myself!  You can seriously spend hours and hours in this place just chilling, without going broke.  Imperial Spa is definitely going to be my relaxation spot whenever I'm in Vegas!"
1,"I've been there many times for a variety of things and have always been pleased with my care.  The personnel obviously like working there, and look at you as patients whom they want to please.  Only two nasty ones (older clerk at the sleep clinic, and an extremely rude PA at the Thunderbird clinic), but that's two out of many dozens of real good ones.    Only drawback is the wait-time for primary doctors, but that may have changed by the time of this post."
0,Awful place. Pathetic staff
0,"This place is overhyped. While the food is good, I feel  that it's nothing to write home about. Ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, angus burger, kiki's burger and I wasn't wowed by it, the portion is small also. Also ordered an apple lychee soda but they never serve the drink but was charged for it. CHECK YOUR BILL! Also, server was slow and inattentive, took forever to get the check and we probably sat there for 15 mins after the meal, and it wasn't busy when we were there."
1,"Once again, Bachi burger does not disappoint! Today we had the sweet potato fries to start, then the chef's special: Spicy Miso Burger and the Lonely Bird burger. \n\nI almost want to retract my previous review of the Ronin being the Death Row burger. The spicy miso burger is definitely a knife-and-forker. The lonely bird was a picker-upper and held it's own. I swear everytime I come here and think that I had already tried the best burger, something new proves me wrong. Never a dull moment in the food adventure at Bachi Burger. Thanks to Melissa our server today for the recommendation! You guys are awesome!"
0,"This place is seriously overrated.  Food is good, but not great.  I think something that bothers me the most is the attitude we got from the staff...as if we were an inconvenience. Yeah buddy, I hate when customers come into my restaurant and give me money too....  Anyways, you can get much better Italian elsewhere!"
1,"This is a place every french food lover must try in Montreal. Such creative high end cuisine in a modern eclectic sophisticated restaurant. \n\nFirst, I had green and white aspargus with pancetta and parmesan cheese as an appetizer. Aspargus were perfectly cooked. These were followed by the atlantic halibut, which was just amazing.\n\nHighlight of the night was the wine. I asked the sommelier for something unique and he brought me a white 1989 Jura. I was first totally absorbed with the nose and then the tasting notes. A wine that I'll probably always remember and that was perfectly paired with the fish. \n\nAs dessert, we tried the kalingo chocolate moelleux and the honey pound cake. They were absolutely delicious!\n\nCheers Toqu\u00e9!"
0,"I should have trusted yelp, My bad. \n\nTo be fair Dillworth is a very competitive restaurant environment, and while Longboards would often be par should I be looking for a taco out in a rural burg there are numerous far better options within a mile or two.\n\nWe were starving and in the mood for some casual fresh cali-mexican and I had plans nearby. Newish place and figured I would stop in. \""Do you want some chips?\"" Sure thanks for offering 3 minutes later \""Here are your chips, the chips are free but salsa is four dollars\"" Huh... Every Mexican dive I have ever been to gives you free salsa, I have seen higher end places charge for premium guac or great tomatillo salsas... so this food must be higher end than I expected...?\n\nIt wasn't. \n\nRegrettably I have experienced more flavor at Chi-Chi's before they poisoned the nation. This was overly safe tex-mex at its most dreary. My burrito did not have a taste of any seasoning whatsoever, that isn't hyperbole, no cilantro, no salt, no spice, nothing, it had to be half a pound of rice punctuated by occasional bits of anything else that I later drowned in hot sauce to be anything but a wrapped pile of monotony. My wife's taco arrived cold and also uninspiring/unbalanced. The price says quality Mexican food but the food doesn't come close to what we can get from food trucks for six bucks in this city. it wouldn't compare close to favorably with Qdoba again for half the price, to compare it to the great restaurants nearby that give you far more quality for the same price isn't worth explaining.\n\n+1 star for the beer selection/bar. Lots of good microbrews. \n\nGood location and good beer make me hopeful they can step up their game to be on par with downtown Charlotte... or even better that they provide a real so-cal experience. Hire a ringer with a good palate. Family friendly doesn't and shouldn't mean bland."
0,"They definitely got the Terrible part right !\n\nThis place totally sucks!\n\nPros:\n*  they had a copy of Las Vegas Weekly for me to pick up\n* Well lit... even in the evening\n*  Perfect gas station to go to if you have lots of time to kill, you strictly only use cash, and enjoy standing in lines!\n\nCons:\n* Their card reader did not read my card... go figure! \n* You have to go inside if you want a copy of your receipt.\n* Service sucks too... surprised?  I didn't think so.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n  Go elsewhere.  I only went here because I was going to run out of gas and I had no choice.  I've been here before and I am honestly not surprised of m disappointments.  Numerous times that I've been here, I have had to go inside to pay for the gas because their card reader was malfunctioning.  They always tell me that their computers are down (whatever that means) because the computers and registers inside were all operating correctly.  Then to have to go back inside to get your receipt?  Forget it.  I didn't want to wait in line with a bunch of other customer who were inconvenienced because their credit cards failed to register upon their swipe.  Avoid this place.  They totally DO NOT upkeep this place.  Beware !!"
1,Love their food! When I was pregnant I ate the red curry like it was going out of style!
0,"Got take out from here today. I was excited to see a new restaurant finally open at this location. The experience however, was not as expected. While the staff is pleasant, the food is mediocre at best. I had the vegan ramen with Togarashi corn, Tofu and Kimchi. The only problem was that the food came with plain corn and no Tofu, although I was definitely charged for both. The broth was lukewarm and extremely salty. Overall, a very disappointing lunch experience."
0,"Let me start by saying, I have the wellness plan with Banfield and I absolutely LOVE our home location in California. I am traveling back to Arizona to visit family and my puppy needed his medication and to finally get his rabies shot. \n\nHe has had worms in the past but that was 2 months ago and he has not been receiving any more medication for it. Before I know what's going on the nurse gave him a de-wormer, she checked his temp and then just shoved something up his rectum without asking or explaining. She did not lubricate it and my puppy screamed. I was so angry. \n\nMy puppy has a history of allergies and since we were afraid he would react to his rabies vaccination, they gave him a shot of Benadryl. While waiting for the shot to kick in, I could clearly see that there was an animal being operated on in an open room with tons of people walking around. Definitely not a sterile environment and I would not recommend bringing a pet here for surgery. \n\nIt also seemed like they were trying to pressure me into scheduling his neuter procedure for this location and I didn't like that. I do plan on neutering him, I just want to do it when I want to and when I can afford it. \n\nLike I said, I adore Banfield and how they work but I won't be bringing my puppy back to this location. We will stick with his normal location back in California. I will make sure my puppy goes to the vet before traveling."
1,"So super happy with this place for our vow renewal.  Everything was on time, efficient, and such pleasant staff to work with.  Was always impressed with the online chat feature, which helped answer all my questions quickly.\nOnly lost one star because we asked for our nicknames on the marquee and they put our regular name.  Plus we thought cake and champagne were available for our 15 guests at the reception afterwards, but it was only for the bride and groom. \nStill, TOTALLY worth it :)"
1,"Had lunch at the bar while my husband attended a conference. The chicken sandwich was fantastic. The smoky chipotle taste really worked with the garlic pesto (I wasn't sure if it would). Not cheap so get a restaurant.com gift certificate. My sandwich, served with fries, was $18. My diet Pepsi was $5...lol and it was from a can so no refills! They need to work on the soda situation. The bartender was friendly."
0,Ate here on 4/25/14. Ordered the chicken nachos which consisted of stale chips topped with a spray on cheese and guacamole that came clearly came from a tube.  I'm honestly not sure it was even guacamole.  I tried to order the chorizo nachos but they were out of chorizo. For the main dish I tried to order corn tortillas for my tacos but they were out of corn tortillas!  Fish tacos were literally a fish stick wrapped in a tortilla. \n\nDon't eat here.
1,"This place is expensive but seems worth it for the most part. The sushi is very diverse and there are a bunch of options that I haven't seen in other sushi buffet restaurants.\n\nI'm not sure how to compare it to other sushi buffet restaurants since if you've been going to other ones like Todai for a while now like me and have gotten tired of the same old stuff then this place is a great place to try something different.\n\nHowever, I only went here once and had a good experience but wouldn't necessarily recommend going to this place or any sushi buffet restaurant all the time."
1,Mothers day just happened to fall whilst we were in Las Vegas. As a daughter it is my responsibility to make sure my mum had a great day. Enter the Chippendales. There was only a group of 4 of us but we had a great time. We were seated in the second row and mum got to see enough bums to last her a lifetime. The dancing was better than the Thunder from down under but at times it did get a little cheesy. I thought that considering we were in Vegas we might see a little more flesh but alas I was disappointed. The guys are extremely attractive and I thought they were worth the money. Definitely worth a visit.
1,"You have to check out The Upton! My sisters and I came for dinner and we loved it. Great service and excellent food. My favorite appetizers were the ribs and the burrata. Order both. You won't be disappointed. For dinner we ordered the fried picnic chicken. So good! For dessert, try the smores. This fabulous new restaurant nestled in old town Scottsdale is a must try! Don't be surprised if this spot becomes your favorite neighborhood go to!"
1,"The reason I am giving this hotel 4 stars is because it is the lowest priced hotel that is not a rat hole, the staff was great, has a pool open 24/7, the hotel was quiet and just a block from the strip and the price is right.   Would we stay there again? In a heartbeat. My wife and I went in December for 4 days.  We had a 2 king room on the 9th floor.  The room was very nice but the hallway smelled like dog poop so we asked for a room on a different floor.  The person at the check-in counter was very accommodating.  He moved us to a 2 king room on the 7th floor with the best possible view the hotel could manage.  The hallway smelled like a hotel (of clean carpet and a hint of bleach) but the room had a faint smell of smoke that was very tolerable.  The staff was very nice including the bartender when she wasn't too busy.  I am only able to comment on the hotel since we didn't see any shows, pull any handles or purchase any drinks though they must have been good because the bar seemed to be full of local patrons."

1,"Forget paying your 10 bucks to a local botanical garden and fly all the way to Vegas and enjoy a free sighting at the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Garden. You know what they say - \""The best things in life are free.\"" Indeed it is. Thank you, Luther & Janet. \n\nYou will be captivated by the thousands of roses that make up a statue and when I say roses, I don't mean the plastic, artificial roses you buy at Walmart. These are fresh garden roses that have been well taken care of and have been treated as V.I.Ps. Among the roses, there are also many different kinds of flowers imported from all over the world (blows your mind, doesn't it?). And they revamp the whole place for holidays as well! \n\nGod bless The Bellagio."

I signed all forms, dotted all i's, crossed all t's.  My credit card continued being billed.  I called, I came in, I disputed with my CC company - still kept being billed.

0,"What in the world happen to this club? They used to play the best music in all of Las Vegas. Now, it seems like they have conformed to the rest of the clubs on the strip. Extremely disappointed in this place. My friends and I spent about $2k expecting a different experience compared to the other major nightclubs in Las Vegas, but all we got was the same music. I loved coming to this place and didn't mind shelling out the money for a table service, but my god, how things have changed. Will not come back to this place anymore. Don't get me wrong, the employees are amazing. They took care of us extremely well. They honestly deserve all the credit, but whoever made the decision to switch up the music..... They made a terrible mistake. Buy a table service elsewhere."
0,"The worst store on the planet!!! Yelp needs to have zero stars. I bought a ton of furniture here at Ashley's the problem was the delivery!!! I had an appointment scheduled for my delivery they canceled it gets better, they schedule another delivery time for me  I wait here all day they get here and decide they are not going to waiting for the elevator which the wait time was 10 minutes and they stormed off I wait another two weeks to get my furniture . They send me the wrong mattress I wait another7 days  for that and they send it the wrong address . Again I repeat never buy here"

Because when you define \""Air\"" as a smoker's patio and \""Earth\"" as weird alien shit on the walls and \""Fire\"" as the burning of your ear drums and \""Water\"" as a place to buy really expensive drinks that dehydrate you, I just can't really comprehend how our $30k millionaire ballers can afford to keep this place going, even in an economic environment that protects only their class. But that's why I'm a $20k impoverished sycophantic parasite on our society. No business sense. \n\nTwo stars for the money they put into this place in the first place. And the elevator to the private VIP bullshit area. Classy. Retarded classiness."
0,"How did we end up eating at a 3.5 star pizza place? We have an Entertainment book, opened it to a random page and a Round Table Pizza coupon was there. Being not too far from the house, we made the trip.\n\nWe had to wait for almost 10 minutes for the guy working the register, and two of the kitchen staff to finish flirting with the girls in front of us that came in to pick up an order that was called in. The staff could not deduce which order was theirs, out of what looked like a very limited number of options. An offhand comment was made that they should sell the girls \""a big bag of 'oregano'\"" - this will become more relevant in a moment.\n\nFINALLY, they finished the debacle that was handing off three pizzas and collecting funds for said food.\n\nWe ordered, had to repeat ourselves multiple times as to what we wanted, the guy behind the counter had the toughest time listening/comprehending/pressing buttons.\n\nWhen our food finally came out, we were wondering about the logic behind their pizza. The wife ordered a specialty pizza that had all sorts of vegetables and some meats in melted cheese. For whatever reason, some of the vegetables were just thrown on *after* the pizza was cooked.\n\nMy BBQ chicken pizza was ok, messy as all could be, but tasted alright. \n\nWhen it came time to rinse my hands of BBQ sauce, I made my way back to the restrooms. Remember when I said the staff's comment earlier would be relevant? There was this very distinct, strong and pungent smoky smell coming from the kitchen area. Wonder what that could be. Not really, I know what it was, I've been to high school and college.\n\nOnce that hit our nostrils, it became clear why the staff could not concentrate or use basic logic to figure out which order to give the customers.\n\nHere we are three days later and my wife is still trying to get to where she feels better. Amazing how eating at a place can have an immediate and long lasting effect on a person. \n\nNeedless to say, we won't be going back to Round Table Pizza, this one or any others. For that much money per pizza, there are many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, better options."
1,"My last meal on earth will be the Rib eye!\n\nI was a bit tired of Bobby Flay and had lost passion for his food and shows and I guess seeing him on the tele all the time is a bit overwhelming. Well this boy has got me on his side again! Absolutely delicious\n! My friend Miriam got the pork which was super amazing! Other than the hostess asking me to remove my baseball hat it was fine. Also if we can afford to eat there and it is in the middle of a casino, don't ever tell me how to dress. \n\nExcellent food."
1,Oliv\u00e8r was so kind and personable. Everything on the menu sounded amazing! But I opted for the sweet treats. I got a couple of tarts to take home (because it was so busy) and enjoyed it with homemade coffee. Yummm! I will definitely be going back
1,"We ordered half the menu here and honestly can not say anything really bad. Tonkatsu was prepared jusr right, light and crispy batter. The japanese curry was the best I had in the city. Beef tataki was tasty and tofu, we couldnt get enough. The potato salad had the right amount of dashi and sweetness,  chicken karaagi was slightly salty for my taste. The best part about this place aside from the amazing food, they served everything like how you would get it in Tokyo and you prepare your own katsu sauce. Definetely going on the fav list!"
1,"Love this place. I honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about them, except that their patio needs to be bigger!!!"
0,"I can't tell you how glad I was to quit this joint. No spin classes available was kind of a downer when I signed up, but I made do. Equipment was always overcrowded or broken, staff was always pushing personal training and would try their best to insult me into signing up. P.s. Not a great tactic guys.\n\nThe final straw was inquiring about adding my boyfriend to my account, we had been told one price at a different location and when we went to the 91st location to sign up Chad told us that was impossible and that we were ridiculous for coming in and wanting to haggle with him. When we didn't want to sign up for twice the price we were quoted he said \""You can do what you want, I don't care!\"" Before walking away from us.\n\nSo thanks Chad, now we're both signed up for Gold's Gym"
1,"After years of passing by this place we finally decided to stop and try it, and i'm glad to say it did not let us down. The chicken wings and ribs were delicious and freshly grilled. The mac&cheese was good but the mash potatoes were salty, the corn is out of a can but i don't care since i didn't go for the corn. The cucumber salad is really good too. The place was very clean and has good customer service. All in all we will be back soon.  loved the outdoor seating!"
0,This Wendy's is very nice  and new. We usually like this place but this occasion we found a bone in our chicken sandwich. We gave it to the man cleaning the lobby. He took it to his supervisor/ manager and know one approached us with an apology or questions. This was in bad taste and we will not be back
1,The food is very tasty and there are tons of interesting fixings. The people are laid back and super friendly! If I lived here I would be a regular.
1,"Whether you are a Kush enthusiast or don't know his work, and whether you are looking to buy or just looking to look, this gallery is fantastic.  I am a Kush collector, and always make a stop at the gallery when I am in town.  His work is only done justice in person, and so even pieces I am familiar with are so enjoyable to look at in person.  I get framing ideas when I am there for pieces I own, and the sales staff meets your needs perfectly based on your desired level of interaction.  If you do decide to purchase, the transacation process is painless and enjoyable."
1,"I am new to Charlotte and this has quickly become one of my go-to restaurants. The food is consistently good. Our servers have never been particularly friendly, but they are generally quick and relatively attentive. I love the veggie burger while the bf enjoys the cajun penne. The double dip is meh. \n\nAs others have said, they can get pretty busy on the weekends, so definitely make a reservation. The fire pit outside is a nice touch as is the back entrance/ exit via Cu Copper (the bar behind 131 Main) for rainy days."
0,Today's service was lack luster as I had to wait 40 minutes for a mimosa and then they ran out if glasses. They had a delay on my coffee because they didn't have a mug available. Really!? So I cancelled our drinks after waiting 40 mins for them. Geesh! \n\nThe brunch is popular and they have some good choices on the buffet but they need to get more cups and glasses. This is service 101.  So disappointed.
0,Came here the other night 15 minutes till close and the Walgreens employee was standing outside the store smoking a cigarette and not letting anyone in. when i showed her it was 15 minutes until close she said my iPhone was fast... interesting because 2 people came up after me and all our phones were the same time. Horrible representation of this popular store.
1,"I have been waiting for this place to open.  This is Some of the best pizza I've ever had.  Theres so many options on the style and flavor you can get.  The garlic rosemary fries were delicious, seasoned perfectly. Great service.  Pizza was cooked perfectly.  I like NY style thin crust and this gives Grimaldis a run for its money.  Can't wait to go back.  I will be a regular when the GVR casino location opens.  Great Happy hour also from 3-6 ."
0,"Everything was just bland.  Maybe we are taco snobs but this place made Rubios look like amazing fancy tacos and everyone knows Rubios is decent but not amazing.\n\nWe tried all three tacos types.  The pastor was overcooked/dry but did have good flavor.  The carne was juicy but lacked any flavor.  The chicken was just bland.  \n\nWe also tried all three burrito types and found the same in them.  The bean and cheese burrito was alright but still nothing special. \n\nThe al pastor salad was better but the meat was cold and still dry.  The dressing was decent and the lettuce crisp.\n\nOne last thing, the salsa for the chips was like that pureed tomato salsa that is watery.  It did have some barely there jalapeno flavor.  We tried the hot and the mild but both tasted the same.  Maybe they gave us two milds. \n\nThe service was very good though.  Everyone was friendly and the place was clean.  We just didn't enjoy the food."
0,"I want to like Icon.  I've dined here 4-5 times over the years and I keep coming back because I think that it must be improving because it stays open, but I'm now convinced that it exists solely based upon its proximity to the Overture Center.\n\nThe food is average.  The service is average at best.  They do have a decent wine selection at a fairly moderate price point.  That may be the high point, along with a decent cocktail menu.\n\nThe tapas menu is inventive, but not well-executed.  \n\nLast evening, the patatas bravas were overcooked and the sauce was very uninspired.  \n\nThe crab cake was too much breading and not enough crab--and only one crab cake for $12 does not seem like a good value.  \n\nThe stuffed piquillo peppers were served too cold, and the cous cous accompanying them was bland and flavorless.  It had clearly been microwaved, too, instead of reheated properly.   \n\nLastly, the short rib served with manchego mashed potatoes sounded divine, but it was stringy and not a good cut of meat.  The potatoes were fine, but very light on manchego.  The sauce was the highlight, but Icon's kitchen was not very generous with it.  \n\nTwo diners left disappointed, not full at all, after four tapas and one drink each for $86.  \n\nIcon:  neither a good meal nor a good deal."
1,"I'm a recent transplant from New York and have been so happy with the great restaurants in Madison. My husband and I ate here last week and I'm still thinking about the food. First off: the ambience. Great space. Beautiful wooden boat upon entry, wonderful lighting, great industrial -- yet comfortable -- chairs. Music was excellent. A little contemporary, chill out, house-y sound. It was a sunday night and the mood was relaxed. \n\nThe food: We started with the smoked fish platter and it was incredible. Wow. Trout, herring, whiting, a little caviar -- delicious. The Arugula Salad was fresh and wonderful. I had the trout for my entree, and the sage flavoring was sublime. My husband had the rabbit special and it was great as well. \n\nI will definitely be back... again... and again. Such a treat when you get excellent food and a great vibe. I should also mention that the staff is lovely. I read some other comments and it's tough for me to see the issues as I was there on a relaxed Sunday night. My experience was that service was good and if our server didn't know something, he did his best to go back and find out. I'm not too uptight about this stuff though if it's delivered by someone with a great attitude."
1,"Don't get me wrong! I love HK Star, but the service is really poor. I have been back twice since the UYE lunch and both times we have been ignored for normal requests, like more water, please, more order please etc.... One of the times was even on a Saturday. Therefore, I am taking 1 star down for the service, BUT I will continue to come here for lunch because it is just damn good as well as the price! \n\nBy the way, their crispy fried tofu with salt and pepper is to die for!"
0,"I tried the Berry Crepe, it was ok, nothing special. They charge me $1.50 for a cup of plain Tap water."
0,"Saw the place on travel channel... Looked awesome... Bought the yelp deal prior to getting there!  Bad choice!  Waited 15 minutes at counter for the one person running the entire place to take our order.  I hear other people ordering and the employee told them that they were out of many items they were ordering!  Then they had no change to make when people were paying their bill!  Last... Food was horrible... Salty, chewy pastrami...yuck...my stomach is still churning..."
1,Took my daughter and her friend out to CNC and they had a blast! The staff was great and the lines weren't long at all.
1,"This is one of my go-to lunch spots in Shadyside. The food and service is consistent, and they have a great beer selection. This is a great place to come and watch a game. You can usually find a seat even when everywhere else is packed because it is not the typical sports bar. It is also a good spot to grab bite late-night.\n\nI came here today and ordered the Tijuana Tuna (this is the only place I will order a tuna sandwich from), and it comes with hot peppers that add a bit of \""kick\"" to the traditional tuna as well as a sweet honey sauce that compliments the spiciness perfectly. The honey sauce also goes great with the chips. Today I tried a bite of the Chicken and Spinach Panini as well and it was equally as appealing - it will probably be what I order next time."
1,"Can I first say, I HATE bra shopping.  At my last bra fitting about 5 years ago at Soma, I was pretty set.  I was told I was a 38DD, and had plenty of nude & black bra's (their only colors in my size).  I was at the mall with a friend from out of town, when she spotted the place, and said, have you ever been?  She said, you have to try.  So literally, dragged me in.   Since it was late (about 8:30 pm, and they closed at 9) they said they couldn't do fittings on all 3 of us; so the other 2 volunteered me.  Sure.   What can I lose.  First, the manager (Caroline Forlivio) was super nice, very apologetic about not sizing my other 2 friends, and they were fine about it.  So I get in the room to undress, and first got a bit nervous cause i saw Purell.   Hmm.   Then she came in and asked if I ever had a bra fitting, I said yes, and she said, they don't size like other places.  At this point my mind is going 100 mph cause all I'm thinking of is the Purell bottle.   So she lookes at me, tugs at the bra I was wearing, and comes back with a plethora of bra's.  They don't tell you your size till the end, which was part of the fun and games.  Immediately, cause of my huge boobs, they tell me about this 3 cut type bra, bla bla bla, and I try it on; and put on my shirt over it, and seriously, my boobs were perkier (read higher), and still looked large, but nice large.  Cleavage was great, I was sold.  Then as I continued trying the other bra's, each fit, looked great.  Usually, bra sizes in the double d's are white, black or nude.  Out of about the 10 bra's she brought in, only 1 was black.  The rest were AMAZING sexy colors and designs not even Victoria Secret has (let alone size).   Needless to say, I walked out after doing surprising damage to my credit card, and have been back numerous times.   If they don't have it, they order it.  Exceptional customer service, friendly, not intimidating at all.    The 3rd friend ended up coming back 2 days later and doing damage on her card..  Oh, and on my size.  Yeah, wasn't a  38, I was smaller, and I wasn't a DD, I was a letter I had NO IDEA bra's came in.  Let's just say gee, I have some big boobies.\n\nI was also introduced to the world of Hanky Panky.   Let me start off, I'm not a thong fan.  I know, I know.  TMI.   Let alone a thong size of one size fits all.  Yeah, no they don't.  I've bought in my day, a skimpy outfit or 2 with a thong and yeah, they don't fit.   So the fact this was 'regular' underwear, I thought now way..  The friend said, I'm getting it, just try it.    Got home, washed all my new underthings - which btw, they said you could wash in a washer which was HEAVEN to my ears!!!   The next day I tried my hanky panky.  By lunchtime, I forgot I had them on!  After work that day, I went back to the store, and stalked up.  AMAZING product.."
1,"I stay at the MGM almost every trip to Vegas. It is one of the best values on the Strip. \n\nThe beds are comfy, the rooms are big enough including spacious bathrooms (how much time do you really spend in your hotel room in Vegas anyway??). There are so many rooms that I tend to get lost coming off of the elevator. Oh well. If you are looking to turn out the light over the entertainment center, the button is inside next to the TV. No need to rip out the entire wall trying to unplug it. \n\nRoom service has been good - never a problem calling down and asking for more towels, etc. \n\nGood bars, plenty of gaming tables. Good shops. Cab lines are not ridiculous. Plenty of Starbucks inside. The pool is great - the lazy river is the best in Vegas. The DJ spins good tunes. \n\nThere is a nice balance of young people, older people, and families at the MGM. \n\nJust an overall great experience time and again."
0,"The first impression about this place is small.\n\nJust got back this week from Vegas and I was looking forward to party at this place but it failed my exceptions.\n\nFirst off we reserve a table in advance and we got there a little after 10:00 Friday and there was a line all the way to the casino doors. Then I asked a couple of the bouncers that where do I check in for table reservations? He told me that I would have to get through the crowd people fighting to get to the club behind the red rope and seriously it looked like a scene from the Titanic with people fighting to get on a life boat. So finally I said screw this and I went around the back side where there was no people and this time I had to work my mojo and get one of the other bouncers attention so I ended up greasing the guy $20.00 to get us to the front of the line which worked to my surprise. So then checked in and we were on our way to our table.\n\n Get to our table which was in the patio area like I requested and  got setup with bottle service,  our service was good with our waitress and security inside was pretty cool. The view was nice on the patio.\n\n    Get down stairs to the to the main club and the dance floor was the size of there bathroom and if you wanted to walk around the club you would need a wristband for that specific room. So then you would get turned back and then you would have to fight your way back with all the hordes of people. \n\n  The low down of this club doesn't flow well and the whole design sucks. The music wasn't very good ether. Very disappointed, would recommend Tryst, Rain, over this club any day."
1,If i had to choose a place for dessert crepe..i'd choose you jean philippe ! the nutella one is my fav...we also ordered chocolate..which was good but not as amazing as nutella cause you know i loveee nutella!

0,"Came here to celebrate my father's birthday. Wildcraft has a reputation for being one of the \""nice places\"" to go to in Waterloo for such occasions. \n\nThe food was decent, but not exceptional. On par with something like a Moxies or a Milestones, but it wasn't that much of a \""nice place\"". Nothing made me go \""wow\"" except for the bill. The complimentary birthday desert was good though!\n\nI remember feeling like I paid too much and left myself a note to write a \""two-star\"" review for that reason. Sorry Wildcraft."
1,"Warning: You will probably suffer from food coma once you finish your meal here. \n\nNot sure if it's the economic situation, but whatever it is, I was so happy to be able come and enjoy my meal without a wait. Lines can be a total drag sometimes.\n\nWhen it comes to quality, Wicked spoon is TOP NOTCH. As of variety, their variety is pretty unique and I want to say they bring out the best of comfort food from different food categories (ie. Gnocchi and Thai Curry). I loved their salad bar and crab legs could have been better if I could have served myself instead of them being served to me.\n\nLike my other reviews on the buffets in Las Vegas, I don't know if this is THE BEST but it's one of my top choices to come to when I have the desire to experience major gluttney. However, my most memorable item here would have to be the desserts. Get at those chocolate covered strawberries w/ the toffee bits. YUM! And the quality and variety of their gelatto is the best."
1,"As far as nightclubs go, the best that I have ever been to...\n\nI like both the Day and Night clubs but the Day club is hella fun!  It has a covered dance floor area with VIP tables.  Outdoors are the cabana and jacuzzis.  Overall the layout is on point.  The pool party has 2 areas with different music playing.  In the afternoon, the shadow of a building falls on the pool party so it didn't feel very hot in 100 degree weather.\n\nThe service here is great.  Sheleen is super cool!\n\nDay club has my type of girls!"
0,"Visited for the first time two weeks ago. The Food is spectacular. Excellent! I'm Sicilian and know good Italian food.  Eggplant wonderful! Pizza was Awesome! Carbonara was THE best! And the Alfredo was great too. No Complaints about the food, by any means. The Chef even came out and shook hands with us and wanted our feedback on the food. \n\nNow for the bad part of this experience. Stephanie was our waitress. She was very nice but hung over and forgetful. We had to ask three separate times for our bread and butter. Had to ask multiple times for our second glass of wine. She never brought our coffee to go with our dessert and we had to ask 3 times for our to go boxes. Finally the busboy who walks by our table is more attentive than our waitress. Three tables came in after us with more settings than our table and they were served before us. Then, the manager (the short guy, couldn't tell you his name because he didn't take the time to come introduce himself to our table like he did EVERY other table) looks at me dead in the eye and never came and asked how our meal was our if everything was ok. I suppose its the short Italian man syndrome. We didn't have a man at our table so he didn't think we were big tippers. Yes, Italian men think like this!\n\nThen our waitress realized that she was so bad with her service and lack of attention that she proceeds to give us a 20% off coupon for the meal but when we get to register it was expired. WTH! \n\n(Oh and waitstaff, please do not tell your customers that you are working two jobs and have given your notice at this location and its too hard to memorize the menu). NOT GOOD! Stick to one job if two is too much for you to handle. There are plenty of waitstaff that need income and would appreciate memorizing the menu SINCE ITS THEIR JOB! Oh, and don't tell your customers that you were out partying the night before and have a hang over. BAD SERVICE!!!! \n\nIll give them one more try since the food was excellent. After that, we will see what review I give."
1,"Super good, especially if you're staying at Treasure Island.  Awesome chicken matzo ball soup (like homemade).  Tasty, crispy, shoe-string fries.  Great rye bread and delicious corned beef.\n\nGoing back for a second time before we leave the hotel cause we liked it that much (however, we'll get it go as it's right in the casino and pretty noisy)."
1,"I've had my share of Margaritas and I must admit that these are the best in town. However, the new Glendale location needs to catch up on the quality of Margaritas as the ones they serve at their parent location (16th street and McDowell). I have faith that they will as they begin to settle down at their new location."
0,"I don't know why I keep coming here.  I went again in August.  I can't tell if it's getting worse or my standards for clubs is higher.  Aesthetics (naked chicks in bathtubs) aside, this club has nothing to offer.  DJ couldn't get the music right the entire evening.  There were drunk bachlorettes getting into fist fights over who could dance on the speaker next and show off their cellulite and botched brazillians.  In addition, the rooftop Tao Beach was open - I think standing in a pizza oven would have been cooler than being on a clay rooftop that baked in the sun all day.  The small pool had not been cleaned after day long Tao beach and was the lovely shade of green milk.  I almost puked a little in my mouth when I thought about all the bacteria and whatever else that was floating around in there.  With the great club choices in Vegas, don't bother with this place at all."
0,"Came for breakfast on our morning of checkout since we had a credit to the restaurant and finally had time to use it.\n\nHad the pancakes that I couldn't even cut with my fork - had to use my knife ... come on, they are pancakes!  My husband had steak and eggs and that was average too, meat was tough an not tasty.  Overall quality was low. With all the great food in Vegas I don't think I'll be coming back. \n\nServers were very nice though."
0,"I got to say this is the most annoying place to shop on the face of the earth.  I go out of my way never to go here.   I am 38 years old and was told to leave because my 29 year old friend who was with me from Argentina didn't bring his passport with him.\n\nMore recently I was shopping there with my 38 year old wife and bought some non-alcoholic mixer and they asked us both for ID'S because they said you can't even be in the store unless your under 21.  I really don't need the aggregation of going through this mess for some fruit juice. \n\nTheir lines always take forever even though there will only be one person in front of you, and the biggest kicker was they were actually out of the item we came for."
1,"Best dive bar ever! The service is always great and the beer is cheap. I have a special place in my heart for their fried shrimp. I will keep coming back here to watch football, chat with the regulars, play some pool or darts & relax."

1,"i don't know what's up with Pho being so medicinal. especially when you're hung-over or still drunk from the Vegas festivities. all of my friends were whining about how much we wanted Pho for dinner- so we went to this place that our local friend took us to. of course we cracked up about the name... Pho-Kim-Long... how can you miss that? oy. \n\nthe service is so-so. our food came out relatively quick.... but we waited forever for our drinks. those were the first things we ordered! however, my soda with sugar & lemon was so delicious... i didn't complain much. my shrimp Pho was decent. everyone else didn't finish their Pho, though. i think we're used to delicious Pho in Seattle. plus, my local friend told us this place was a little Americanized and not the very best. it was our last choice because of what time it was."

1,"The BEST spice store on the planet. It was convenient when they were in Scottsdale, but now that they are at Tempe Marketplace, I go every chance I get.\n\nSo why only four stars?

0,"SAINT PATRICKS DAY PEOPLE!?  so disappointed. I went there  ON  SAINT PATRICKS DAY!!! The holiest of all Irish holy days?!?! \n  At 5 p.m. there were about 10 people in the bar. What??? 10 PEOPLE?!?  (i even took photos because i could not believe it.) came back around 8 pm. maybe 25 people in the bar. Isn't this an Irish Bar??  it was SAINT PATRICKS DAY!?!?!  Most bars would have a line down the block by 8 pm.. \nwe had a  room booked at the Orleans so after we ate i wandered back to Brendan's to hear the Irish band. (which did not seem all that Irish)  Now the bar had maybe 40 people tops. I was very confused? did they not promote it? Sorry, I hate to give negative reviews, but thats  what Yelp is for. reviews.  its my opinion and thats all.\n\n  The Guinness was cold and the staff was nice enough. but my complaint is my utter shock and the lack of people on a national Irish Holiday."
1,"Oh goodness I have spent a LOT of time in this airport. Living in New Orleans means flying through other cities with bigger airports quite often, and Charlotte-Douglas International is one of the nicer ones that I get to frequent. \nThis airport is pretty large, but has moving sidewalks that help you get a little boost while going from terminal to terminal. The entire place is clean and sparkly, like new. There are many shops including food options, toy stores, etc. I think there is any type of store that you could want. \nSo, if you're stuck in North Carolina with a long layover you can have a great meal, do some shopping, and then cuddle up in one of the rocking chairs and just enjoy yourself before you get on your plane."
1,"This is a good hobby shop. They have a huge selection of remote control everything. Helicopters, planes, jets, trucks, etc. They also have a good selection of other hobby items as well. Such as, some Duncan yo-yo models that I have never seen before, good selection of Gala kites as well as other kites. They have a good variety of models and model accessories. This place has everything a hobby shop should have.\nThey also have a dirt track outside in the parking lot that you can race your remote control cars on. It's pretty big with jumps and all the bells and whistles. I have never participated in this but if your into that kinda stuff, well then I'm sure you already know bout this place and typing of it is moot."
0,"We visited this establishment on a Wed night  (June, 2014).  Found a large wine selection but the bartender was not a good communicator and lacked enthusiasm for what he does.  He did let us sample our choice tho at our request before making our purchase.  Settled for the Red Sangria and ordered the Pub Board.  Neither were all that good especially the Pub Board, very disappointed from what I had seen there earlier and prices were high.  After 2 glasses of wine and the Pub Board it cost $30.00 which I thought was very expensive.  Very disappointed."
1,"Hoover Dam tour\nGreat tour company. I was in an off strip hotel and other tour companies throughout my week here refused to come pick me up. This company offered to come get me for $20 extra - much less than a cab fare. I turned them down however as I had a rental. I drove to a strip hotel to get picked up. The driver was early. The Hummer H2 was clean and nice and provided a smooth ride. The Hummer seats a driver plus 7 - 2 in the back, 3 in the middle and 1 up front with the driver. We stopped to pick up 4 others then drove 45 minutes out to the Hoover Dam. All the way he provided commentary on history and what we were seeing. At the dam he drove us around so we could get pictures then he gave us our tickets for the power plant tour. We had the tour and time to take pics - about 2 hrs in all before we met up again for the ride back. He does not do the guiding at the dam, a dam employee does that. He was very knowledgeable however about the dam and could answer any questions. I really recommend this tour company. Even though since I had a rental I could have driven out here myself the guide did definitely add value to the experience. It was also nice to have the logistics all taken care of."
0,"NOT WORTH THE RISK!\nAs others have said, the $2.25 price on the outside of the building is false advertising... not even dress shirts are priced at $2.25 any more, they're $2.50 now (still a good price comparatively). But that's just the beginning. The customer service could. not. get. worse. To be fair, I've been going there for years and have have had an ok experience. I've had a couple items go missing in that time, which happens. After a couple trips back to the store they've been found and everything has always been cleaned pretty well. If not, send it back and they do a spot treatment and take care of it.\n\nHowever, my most recent experience has made me decide to leave AC for good... it's just not worth the risk any more. I took a large bedding item in to be cleaned November 7, and it was lost. They had me return to the store over and over to look at all kinds of bedding that did not fit the description of my item and finally they admitted that it must have been lost or given to another customer. Now it's been over two months and the issue is still not resolved. \n\nAfter dozens - I'm not exaggerating - at least two dozen unreturned phone calls, I'm still waiting for a refund on my debit card. I finally tracked down a manager and he was very polite and agreed to pay for me to purchase replacement bedding, and said one of the store associates would get my $30 refund processed (the cost of cleaning) the very next day. It's a good thing I was checking my debit card statements for that refund because it never happened and no one ever followed up with me to let me know there was difficulty processing the refund. I finally decided to call the store daily (sometimes twice or three times a day) until it got a resolution. The store associates are quite nice, but very unprofessional and condescending, calling me \""Sweetie\"" and telling me they would call me back or telling me they would resolve the issue and then never doing so. They'd ask me to come into the store in person, I'd go in, and then they couldn't help and said they'd call me the next day and would not. The whole process has been absolutely exhausting. \n\nFor most companies, their customer service policy is \""The customer is always right.\"" For AC, it seems their customer service policy is more along the lines of \""Ignore them and hope the problem will resolve itself.\"" Not very effective."
0,"Ok. So I realize this place is called \""Sugar Factory\"" and we're in Las Vegas, but dear god. I could smell the diabetes in that place, and the novelty was kind of lost on me. A group of us traveling together for a friends bachelorette party came here for breakfast, and I was kind of disappointed by the food. \n\nI ordered a cappuccino to start off, which prompted the server to ask \""just a regular cappuccino?\"". I was kind of confused by her confusion, but I confirmed a wanted a REGULAR cappuccino. What I received was some kind of melted fudge sludge that resembled a cappuccino in no way whatsoever. It didn't resemble coffee of any kind actually. It was HUGE, covered in whipped cream and white chocolate, and tasted like carnation hot chocolate mix with extra sugar added. I am not one to ever send anything back to the kitchen. I just feel like too much of an ass. But this was so far off base from a cappuccino, I couldn't drink it. That and I have a profound phobia of developing diabetes, and this thing was like eating spoonfuls of white sugar. I told the waitress that I suspected that perhaps my order was mistakenly made to be a hot chocolate, because it tasted nothing like a cappuccino. She said that she didn't watch it being made, so she didn't know for sure what it was. I kindly asked her if I could replace it for a black tea. She brought me one mug of hot water and a tea bag in a package. No saucer, no spoon, no honey or milk or sugar. Later, when the bill would arrive, the server had not removed the \""cappuccino\"" charge, and replaced it for tea. So I ended up with a $6 tea.  \n\nRealizing I wouldn't be interested in any of the sweet options on the breakfast menu, I decided to order the \""Manhattan\"" eggs benny (smoked salmon). At $18, the price was pretty steep. When it arrived, the hashbrowns looked bland, and the plate was generally underwhelming. Looks did not deceive. The hollandaise tasted like it came out of a package, the eggs were overcooked, and the hashbrowns were boring. \n\nBad food, bad service, and hideously overpriced. My final word is don't bother. I think you'd be better served scavenging your hotel's breakfast buffet."
1,"Our son has been attending USA Gymnastics for the past 3 years.  His athletic ability and physical strength have grow by leaps and bounds.  Gymnastics has really helped him progress in his Tae Kwon Do training as well.  He goes to classes two times a week.  When we attended the Gilbert location, we had problems with his Friday night coach changing on almost a weekly basis.  Since we've been at Queen Creek, he's had a consistent (and fabulous) coach who has helped him progress.  His coach has a lot of energy and patience.  He knows what he is doing and he is also a gymnast.  He is able to keep the young boys engaged and focused throughout the class.  I can't say enough good things about the new Queen Creek location!!"

Secondly, it's Vegas -- NOTHING IS AUTHENTIC. \n\nA little on the expensive side but the atmosphere is fantastic  and the service is pretty good. Just drink a little before dinner and enjoy yourself.\n\nThe food is all pretty good. I've only had a handful of items on the menu (roughly 5-10) but honestly was never disappointed. Of course it wasn't the best food in the world, but honestly it still is pretty damn good. \n\nThe star is taken off for the prices. Yes, I know I mentioned you can get a good amount off but there is no reason to charge me almost 20 bucks for a bowl of pho. Seriously, no reason at all. That being said, I will go back and get the pho next time I'm there. Damn.\n\nBut seriously, you are eating a restaurant in a 5-star resort -- things are going to be overpriced. There is a Panda Express somewhere on the strip, if you don't want to pay for the experience."
1,"Oh dear lord this place is good.\n\nI go to the turf more often than I'd care to admit and I've always wondered what the food here was like.  I'm really picky when it comes to pizza or italian food as most places tend to put way too much sugar in their marinara.  \n\nA friend and I wanted to try some place neither of us had been and I'd heard good things about this place from some friends so I decided to give it a try.  We ordered a salad, pizza and a couple drinks.  We were both blown away with not only the service but the food as well.  \n\nThere are a couple of artisan pizza places not that far from Pomo that get a lot of attention but I'm honestly not a fan.  Pomo is hands down my favorite pizza place in AZ."
1,"The Heart Attack Grill is fun.\n\nIf you love kooky stuff like hospital gowns, sexy nurses, and crazy alarms, you'll be right at home here. The food here is EXTREMELY indulgent, but it all tastes great (yes, even the butter chocolate shake). \n\nIt's not gourmet, but it makes for a good vacation destination."
0,"Called at 8:30pm on a Monday (according to both Yelp and their website, they are open at this time) to place a pick-up order (our first with this business) only to get the \""We're closed\"" voicemail. \n\nMajor bummer. Their online website/menu left us drooling. We SO wanted their Chicken Parm sub and Yelp famous garlic knots.\n\nNOT A DEAL BREAKER as we don't know why they were closed. Will update accordingly when we have been able to try them out."
1,"When I want to feel like I am eating really healthy or pretending to be a vegetarian for a meal, I love Pita Jungle.\n\nBut the whole truth is there is no where I have found in AZ or SD that has better Falafel than Pita Jungle. Their Falafel's are perfect, crunchy and not oily at all. They must have some miracle oil that does penetrate the food, because sometimes I forget they are fried! And when you order the Falafel platter it comes with lots of fresh tomatoes, pickles (my favorite), Red onions, and lettuce. Make your own wraps with the pitas provided and you are in HEAVEN! \n\nOh and don't forget their Mediterranean platter, with tons of great hummus, tabuli, baba ganouj, and my favorite a cold green bean salad, which I know doesn't sound that appetizing, but try it just once and you will be hooked! \n\nThe food is always fresh, healthy, and oh so yummy!  And they are expanding all the time! Which means getting good food will be easier! New location to open in Phoenix and Tucson!"
1,I always get good service going through the drive-through mostly. I hardly ever have to wait since this is the less busiest location. I've never had a bad experience.
0,"I created a yelp account just so i could comment on this restaurant because I w disgusted by the experience.  The waitstaff was horrible. The restaurant was not even busy. As people arrived, they made them wait 30 mins and then seated them at tables that had been open the entire time. The food was good but I will never go back given the horrible experience."
1,A fun stop on a long road.
1,"We really enjoy dinner at Sensi. We have been there twice so far, with two sets of visiting family members. My husband and I first found out about this restaurant via the Vegas Vegan's blog. Vegetarian and vegan fine dining can be hard to find here. We found that the managers, servers, and chefs made certain that our mixed table of vegetarians and meat eaters all had delicious meals. They are pricier, yes, but the food makes it worthwhile. Highly recommended."
0,"We joined this club in 2006 and resigned five years later-very stand offish people and course that was too easy! Beware of the friendly \""sales pitch\"" when you ask about a membership-what you see is not what you get! Food is just average in the club house and menu does not change at all. Friendly bartenders at the West facing bar with the great view, but that's about it!"
1,"Great food, great ambiance. Huge selection of roasted coffees and juices. I recommend the Jolt - frozen espresso goodness. The service is always up to speed and friendly."
1,"The pros: Excellent food, good customer service. I have eaten at Gandolfo's three times now, and they consistently use high quality breads, cheeses, and meats. \n\nThe Cons: The drink options are lacking and the potato salad is awful. Other than that, they are excellent. \n\nOverall, I would bring my friends and family here for lunch."
1,"the owners were very nice. the pizza crust was nice and a bit crispy which is the way i like it. i had the pepperoni, cheese, chicken, and veggie pizza all good and do able...yes its buffet but this is no cici's quality thank goodness. i have been craving a buffet pizza joint here in uptown and found this gem. they also have cherrywine on tap! i will def be back."
0,"Huge disappointment - after reading all the great reviews on Yelp, I decided to have my family's Christmas dinner at Mon Ami Gabi.  Perhaps it was Christmas and the chef wasn't around or there was no delivery of fresh steak on Christmas day or whatever, but the steaks were the worst we've ever had at a restaurant that claimed to be a steakhouse of any sort.        \n\nWe had the following: \n\n- French onion soup - standard, decent, not spectacular\n- Frisee & bacon salad - tasty\n- Steak au poivre\n- Steak roquefort\n- Filet mignon with merlot butter  and red wine reduction\n\nI think the problem is with quality of the steaks, the sauces were fine, but my mom's steak roquefort had the texture of cotton, my sister's steak au poivre had the texture of cotton with lots of veins and fat lumps, my filet mignon had a stringy texture like a inferior cut of meat and was not at all firm.  It was so bad that we left much of the entree untouched and left right after the main course, we didn't even have dessert on Christmas!!  This was a very disappointing meal and ruined our Christmas.  \n\nOn the other hand, the service was fine and the  prices were definitely cheaper than traditional steakhouses, $31 for the filet and $23 for the regular steaks, but the quality is not anywhere near Ruth Chris, Morton or Fleming's."
1,"As far as on campus grub goes this place is top class. The Boston Dog is a classic here; in my opinion it's their best menu item. The reason I'm so high on this place is that for an on campus establishment it's actually reasonably priced paired with quality food. They are definitely known for their hot dogs but they do have other items (the sliders are good) and are now serving breakfast (haven't tried it yet). If you're ever on campus and looking for a spot to eat, I would recommend Dave's anytime."
0,"My son and daughter-in-law were so hyped about going to this buffet because of the seafood varieties, kobe beef, lamb, etc.  While there was a nice variety, I felt the quality was not up to par.  The crab legs were cold, too much rice on the sushi, shrimp tasteless, kobe beef was not as tender as expected.  The sea bass and lamb were exceptional.  Unfortunately, the worst part of this experience, were the people seated next to us with a screaming toddler and small child. The parents tried to placate them by letting them wander around and be very disruptive. This went on for 60 minutes, until we could not deal with it anymore.  This has got to be the worst dining experience trying to digest food with a screaming toddler next to you. Maybe the food would have tasted better with a better atmosphere.  Staff should have spoken to the family!!!"
0,"If I could give no stars, I would.\n\nI went today and it was awful.  I couldn't even finish my meal.  If anyone wants to try REAL Ethiopian flavor that will rock your soul, go to the place around the corner on S Highland called Abay.  It's been here longer, the staff is friendlier and more knowledgeable, the ambiance is better, the selection is wider, you get more for your money and the food is incredible.  I tried Tana just because it was new and I will never return for the cold flavorless food.  Seriously, go to Abay."
1,I was talking up this truffle and salt mix with my friend to which she mentioned how she had to have it. I told her they only sell it at W-S and made our way to this location. \n\nStaff was really nice and seemed very knowledgeable in the products they carried. There was never a hestitate to offer help as my friend and I spent 30 minutes walking around. \n\nNot quite the size of the San Francisco store (freaking 4 stories) as it was on the smaller size but they carried most everything you need for your modern day kitchen.
1,"I love all the staff here. They really care about you and your dog. I will continue to bring my dog and future dogs here for every problem they have. My czech german shepherd is very protective of us and they take precaution with him and take him to the back room to prevent any of that. My dog a couple months ago was at the vet for some minor limping, then took him back the next month because he was still having the problem. They gave me an xray and sedative quote incase I needed to have it done, and even called to check and see how he was doing. =) THANK YOU! I trust all the vets this is a great establishment. I do not prefer one vet over the other I think they are all simply amazing."
0,"Food\n\nJust say no. I ordered the grilled cheese with turkey. It was so salty that it was barely edible. The sandwich was pretty small for $5.50, I was hoping that the sandwich would be somewhat filling. I did not make it a platter meal because the side options were terrible. Four out of seven are mayonnaise based salads. The other three are pickled or vinegar. Sauerkraut is prevalent throughout the menu. I understand every establishment has to have a style or niche but there was nothing that appealed to me.\n\n\nService\n\nThe service was pretty slow. They do not take names or numbers for the orders. So every time something comes up in the window they stop at every table and ask who it belongs to. It is pretty annoying when you are six orders back from the front of the line.\n\nI have no intention of heading back."
1,"I've be coming here quite regularly for the past four or five years and I love it.\nWhen it's busy it has a really good buzz. The staff are friendly and normally quite efficient although I have had to ask for the bill more than once on a few occasions. It can be a bit awkward for lunch during the week when it's much quieter as the room is rather large but the food is consistently good, which I think is partly due to their abridged menu for these quieter times. \nI am particularly fond of their pizza. Having spent a lot of time in Italy and eating a lot of pizza there, I am quite fussy, however their base is not too soft and they use good quality mozzarella so it keeps me happy. I would perhaps even go as far as saying it is the best pizza I have had in Edinburgh.\nBetween me and my fiance we have sampled quite a few of their pasta dishes, his favourite being spaghetti with seafood. We do both have a small issue with them putting onion in their ammatriciana sauce though. I know it's a personal choice thing, with onion and without onion are both served in Rome, but it was too crunchy, not cooked enough.\nNormally when I go I eat so much for starter and main that I rarely have room for desert but once or twice I have ordered the tartufo (chocolate and vanilla ice-cream in a bombe with cocoa and nuts) which is especially nice if you ask them to pour an espresso over it for you!\nOverall, I really like this place. Good value for money, good quality food, clean toilets. Just don't be in a hurry to leave afterwards, or ask for the bill a bit before you're ready for it."
0,Tried twice to visit Wolfgang Puck's in Las Vegas (City Center) and L.A. (L.A Live). Both times we arrived 90 minutes before closing time and we were told we couldn't have a table because it was too late! Their lack of professionalism it's incredible. They shouldn't Write a closing time if it is not going to be implemented! I'm sure that the neighboring restaurants appreciate this apparently sistematic way of managing their businesses.
0,"It was NOT reflexology. Mostly body massage & only 10 min total on hands & feet combined. 90% of time on my feet was with the edge of a massage stone, not even hand massage or pressure points. Disappointing. My feet feel cheated! If you want a cheap, decent massage, this place is ok. If you're looking for a true reflexology hand/feet experience, go elsewhere!"
0,Consistently the worst buffalo wild wings in town. No one answered the phone i come in and no one is even at the take out window. They always have bad service here. \n\n\nGo to durango and warm springs. Dont waste your time
0,"$6.99 per person for lunch buffet. So cheap, right?? Well, you get what you pay for. The Mongolian BBQ was pretty good, as well as the soups. Other stuff was just meh. A lot of greasiness.\n\nProbably won't be going here again, even though the restaurant was packed. I think I'll try a real Asian buffet next time."
0,"come for drinks only food is pathetic ,feels like they have microwaved frozen chicken n served"
0,First time they came they did a good just cleaning the carpet but there where spots on the floor that they didn't clean up.  Second time they came they came late they where suppose to come in the morning from 8am to 12pm which they came after 1pm. When they came for the second time they took out one spot but not the other.
0,Food was fair. We have been to the other Roys at JW much better. Had steak which was fair for the price. Mashed potatoes had no taste and looked like cheap instant potatoes. Deseret was sent back as it was cold and not fresh. In the end we paid like $80 for meal. It was a waste of money. Won't go back to this one again.
1,"Stopped in on Friday for a couple of drinks after work. I had never been here before, but read about it in New Times a while back. I liked it a lot. They had a live guitar player/singer on the roof top. I didn't pay enough attention to get his name or anything, but he was very entertaining. I didn't really eat anything besides a bite or two of my friend's burger, so I don't have much of a critique on the food, but the couple bites of my friend's burger were enough to get a very high rating from me! I forget which burger it was, but it had mushrooms on it and it was AWESOME. I went for the local beers, and the local beers are what I ordered. The selection was excellent. They had about 40 beers on the menu! The only bummer was that they were out of my first 3 choices lol. The waiter said the reason for being out of so much stuff was that they only server locally brewed beers, and it isn't as easy to call up a local brewer and order 10 kegs as it is to call up a big brewery and do it, which is understandable I guess. Either way, I kept choosing until I picked a few that they weren't out of, and was very impressed. I had a very good blueberry beer (forgive me, I don't remember any of the names), a grapefruit beer which was absolutely fantastic, and a chocolate stout to finish it all off. The roof was packed with people like a night club by the time we left, which was around 8pm, so I guess it is better to get there early, unless of course a night club is what you're looking for. I'll probably stop back in the next time I'm in the area and looking to quiet a beer craving."
0,"Lousy food, cold onion rings small oysters, slow service for $16 burgers. I think NOT"
0,"Based on my experience at STK, I think it's highly overrated.  Here goes:\n\nHad a 6:30 reservation and arrived a little bit early.  The hostess selected a really crummy table, but there were lots of other better tables available, and the place was not busy at all.  Having none of that, I asked for a better table and got a little better one.  The thing is, they seat you cheek by jowl, and it isn't comfortable, and certainly doesn't seem like fine dining.  \n\nAtmosphere?  Granted, it was still early, but there was no DJ playing, and the place seemed dead.  Under those conditions, the concept of this place doesn't work.  It felt like eating at CPK at the mall.  \n\nThe food?  The food must be amazing, right?  Not so much.  The food was in the ballpark, but I've had better at lots of places.  \n\nThe service?  Apart from the clueless hostess, the service was good.  The wait staff was attentive but not overbearing.  They handled the meal fine. \n\nAll in all, I'm in no hurry to return to STK Las Vegas."
0,"Home Depot doesnt care about the \""little guy\""anymore who stayed faithful throughout the recession.  Now they are too busy, as Queen Creek is adding thousands of homes. \n\nI just dropped my $4500 counter project, too many extras, they charge you if you sneeze.\nBut the part that made me really drop the project was when I had to schedule the backsplash work seperately, which was fine.  \n\nUNTIL\n\nThe rudest, \""B\"" of a woman, who claimed to be some manager, in essence told me, something totally opposite of what other workers had said and it made me feel like an insignificant  speck.   \""My business was unimportant and they will get out when they are ready to measure the backsplash and forget about it being done by Thanksgiving.\"" So the countertop would be in but the walls torn up until they can get to it, even though I am planning way ahead.\n\nI was absolutely floored by that attitude,  so I cancelled the project and closed my credit card account, which they had originally solicited me for.\n\nLike any corporation,  One customer loss, no big deal but if millions walk away, the little guy can regain some power over these jerks!!"
0,"Meat Market for real..can't believe how people go to be social and flirting all the time.\ni couldn't believe my eyes..the comments people make of older people working out.\nand how rude they are about fat people..Not everyone wants to be a Juice head with no balls....i'm 6'5 and about 235 at the moment...can't believe that people accutally got to a gym to make fun of other people and just hang out and and hit on each other..since when does make up apply to a work out routine..so many girls trying to look their best...and the guys just come over like wet dogs showing their true colors....like a Cartoon Episode of Johnny Bravo....\n\nstaff is unhelp and straight dumb who hires these people, oh i know other dumb people..the place is a meat market for Bimbos and Juice heads..the few peopl that do go to work out, do their thing and bam gone..Peak Hours is just insane....even off peaks it's like Chicago traffic non stop.......\nbut no one really pushing themselves just hitting on girls and girls heading and falling for Juice Muscles...so crazy....\n\nfees fees fees...that's all i can say...i'm not keeping these weak ass staff members employed with my money...\n\nI'm Half way to my goal..thank you...OTHER GYM....."
0,"Avoid. It reminds me of a Hometown Buffet chain. The food is plentiful as is the selection, and some of the items are good. But the it comes off as a cheap cafeteria. It looks old and run down, and some of the food looks like its been sitting there forever."
0,"I came here twice in one week for teppanyaki , but I will never come back after the second time. The first time I came here, my experience was so awesome! The chef wasn't that good at doing his little tricks, but he was still entertaining. It was during normal hours, and I fell in love with their fried rice and mushrooms. \nThree days later, I came really late at night during their happy hour. We ordered about the same amount food like last time. The server told us it's 50% off so we get half the portions, but it's the same exact food as the normal menu. So we ordered twice as much. \n\nHere comes the chef who looked at us like, \""great some of my customers are 12 year olds.\"" Just because we look young, doesn't mean you start downgrading your service (I despise servers like that, and yes, we do look like 12 year olds). I told him twice before he started that no onions on any of our food (my bf is allergic), and he said, \""I'm going to put lots of onions.\"" He said it in a joking way, but I said it again after just to be sure. He started doing his thing, and he cooked fried rice for the other customers first WITH onions and then he used to same grill to cook our fried rice without cleaning it. The previous chef we had was not like that. He acknowledged our request, and he put us first. Our fried rice had onions...good thing we're smart enough to check. He got even worse when it came to the veggies. He cooked the veggies all at once for everybody, and gave us veggies with onions. Then he goes, \""It might have a little onion.\"" After that I was so done. I wasn't going to complain anymore because to me this restaurant doesn't exist. I was planning on taking my family here for my graduation dinner, but no thanks. He didn't even give us any mushrooms...he gave all the mushrooms to everybody else. I love mushrooms. I thought we were supposed to get the exact same thing as regular menu. We paid the same amount we did for the regular menu. I hate this place with a burning passion. Please, train your chefs what \""No onions!\"" mean, and how to provide service."
0,The food is always good but the service has been very poor every time I go. We started getting carry out over dining it because of how poor the service is.
0,"I really liked this place UNTIL I realized that they don't clean their shrimp. Our server asked what was wrong and she told me that it's okay to eat that way and that they never clean their shrimp. \n\nThanks, but that's gross. CLEAN YOUR SHRIMP."
1,Excellant lamb shank that falls off the bone. I have also had their gyro and is spot on. I little small so you might have to wait on peak times.
1,"This is, I'll be honest, kind of my favourite kind of bar, and a redeeming aspect of my stay at the Ruby Marie. On my way towards my (obviously haunted) room one night, I heard a live band playing a beautiful cover of Tom Petty's Time to Move On, so I went alone to the Up North Bar instead, seeking a little dose of courage from Tom and from the taps of delicious local Wisconsin beer. \n\nThe bartenders here are nice. Deeply friendly and and chill and nice. And it's easy to chat to anyone in this bar, folks are friendly and easy going and I guess it's a Wisconsin thing? But listen, I went to some places where the folks were as cold and pretentious as one might expect from a different sized town, but here at the Up North everyone was cool. \n\nPlay the dice game, you could win a free beer or a pile of cash. Check out the vintage bar back, a massive piece of art-deco carved wood with long lights that has it's exact match at a bar in Montreal! Obviously, this bar is part of my extended spiritual home."
0,"used to be 4-5 stars but now that they are owned by Landry Restaurants-who redid the menu-it just not the same./The vibe and expansive menu has been hacked. Landry Management reevaluated the menu and decided the menu was too diverse and many favorites are gone from the menu.\n\nAlso, the care and cutesie-ness are gone and you can tell they have gone corporate. No more fun here and the changes are not for the better, Our meal was good, but not like before. Fresher, hot food made with care versus a production line.\n\n Sorry, we won't be back because we miss OUR Claim Jumper"
0,"So one afternoon, stopped by to eat a chicken teriyaki sandwich. Looked pretty good.\n\nI have this weird thing of chopping my subs into one bite sizes, so was doing that as usual.\nafter I have half of my sub, I find a piece of chiken..... pink inside.\n\nThey served me a half raw chicken sub!\n\nI mean, I noticed this cause of my weird hobby of chopping my sandwich but if I didn't, I probably wouldn't of noticed. . .  don't wanna think about that.\n\nI went to show them that and, they remade me a new chicken teriyaki sub (which was nice) but. . .  I totally lost my appitite and was scared of imagening finding another half raw chicken in my sandwich.\n\nThere's other subway's in town so probably go to those, never back to this one."
0,"Food and service were just ok. We left our camera on the table after the meal. One waitress told us she saw it and kept it inside, then the ones inside denied and took it. Have left stuff at many places before, hard to find such dishonesty in North America."
0,"just awful, listening to their sales pitch over and over by telemarketers felt more like I was dealing with AT&T than an actual school. And it took forever to get them to tell me how much the school costs, important to know for most people. Anyway this is not a real school."
1,"Are there any sucky Thai restaurants out there?  I'd be hard pressed to find one.  The small differences in flavor I believe are a matter of personal preference.  So it really boils down to the dining experience for me.  Weera is a low-key, intimate space with soft lighting and a conservative selection of sakes and wine.  When we went, there were couples on dates, families with kids, groups of friends and a table of 6-footer models.  I think anyone would be happy with this space and food.  Service was great but quite slow on a Friday night.  \n\nThe first bite we had of their pad thai was bit of a letdown, but the next few bites we took must've had some voodoo spice or spell because we were loving it more and more.  It was a dish that did not wow you with a punch, but the flavors crept up on you like the butler on Mr. Deeds... very very sneaky.  We also had the Thai chicken wings, sauce on the side for my little man.  Bad idea.  There wasn't any flavor on the naked wing.  The final order was Crispy Pork Basil.  I haven't heard my hubby say it in a long time but he muttered \""Holy Lord God.\""  He was enamored.  To me, it was very good, close to perfection with its slightly sweet buttery sauce, the balance with crisp vegetables and the yummy fried pork (normally I like to keep the sauce off fried skin to keep it crisp).  Overall though, we were very happy with the food.  They even provide kiddie plates.  50 brownie points right there!\n\nSo many Thai options... but we would definitely go back to this one.  Wee heart you Weera!"
1,"We called late on Xmas eve and they were going to close early, but thank goodness they were able to accommodate us.  They were more than happy to have our take-out order ready, and fast.  Everything was great and the family was impressed.  We especially liked the Kung Pao Chicken.  Also ordered the Jalepeno Chicken Wings (just ok, a little overcooked), Potstickers (good), and Orange Chicken (yum). Also included in our order were egg rolls (good, would have been perfect if not a little overcooked), fried rice (so-so), steamed rice (fine), and two fried shrimp (yum).  Definitely give them a try!"
0,"The service was just awful, I sat for like 30 mins at the bar that wasn't even busy at the time. What pisses me off the most was that I had to approach one of the servers and let them know what's up. 07-22-14"
1,The steaks are phenomenal and way too large for a normal person. The highlight was a tiny glass of potato soup with a drizzle of green leek puree. I wish I had a bowl of this delicious soup. \n\nBeautiful wine collection.\n\nExcellent service and a beautiful place. Very reminiscent of a classic Las Vegas steak house. \n\nWould definitely visit again.
1,"This is the best buffet in Downtown Vegas.\n\nThere are better buffets on the strip, they cost a little more and are of a much higher quality. But for downtown, this is pretty good and a good value. Comparing it to the Strip is not fair. Compare it to the Main Street Station buffet and it is amazing. \n\nCompare it to the Nugget's own Carson Street Cafe (a place that has gone downhill) and the buffet is amazing."
0,"Just ordered two large pizzas and OMG my whole family is complaining how much it sucks.  I only ordered from here thinking it would be a step up from dominos, but NOOO.  Do not waste your money going here, Little Caesars is better and much cheaper.  The dough was soggy and it took over an hour to get here, not to mention that it was cold by the time it arrived.  STAY AWAY!!! I will never order here again, what a waste of 35 dollars."
1,"Having brunch in Montreal is our last to-do before we headed back to Manhattan. We relied on Yelp to give us guidance and we ended up in La Cantine. It was Sunday afternoon and there was a line although not as terrible as it could get in West Village here. \n\nWe waited about twenty minutes before we finally got seated in the back room where there is comfy sofa. I ordered the Aunt Baby's Club which has bacon, cheddar cheese, tomatoes and mayo and eggs inside a soft and tender bun. It also comes with mashed potato and fresh sliced fruit. I really like my sandwich and it is just very buttery and cheesy at the same time. \n\nI got to try my husband's La Totale and it is definitely the best on the menu if you are a meat lover. The ham is so fresh and and bacon is juicy and fatty. I think we all felt food coma after the meal. The price is about $14 a plate without any juice or coffee. So it is about $20 a person if you order an entree and a coffee. Glad we ended our brunch lovely and full!"
1,"I'd give the SliderTruck a 4 and 1/2.  They lose 1/2 a star for the wait (45 minutes in my case).  However, there is a bit of a disclaimer stating the sliders are cooked to order.\n\nHere goes.\n\nSo I was actually planning on hitting up the Fukuburger truck tonight with a big order for my buddies at work... but that truck was 3 hours late.  I follow both on Twitter and remembered Slidin Thru was just up the road.  I get there and the line didn't seem too bad, but I guess there were a bunch of large orders (the ladies in front of me ordered TEN sliders for the two of them...my kind of girls)\n\nIts finally my turn to get some window love and I'm left standing there for a couple of minutes before my order is taken... but its ok.  There are 3 guys working the truck and they all have that dorky but cute thing going on.  They were out of regular fries and the lady in front of me snagged the last orange Fanta in a glass bottle :(\n\nI ordered 6 sliders (1 of everything on the menu; I figured, try the menu the first time so the next time I know which ones I REALLY liked) and an order of cinnamon sugar sweet potato fries. All to go.  The food came up quick, piping hot, and I knew everything was fresh because you could see them cooking it.\n\nSurprisingly, the sliders were still warm when I got home about half an hour later.  Unfortunately, I got in a bit of a fender bender trying to exit the parking lot (some db orthodontist in a giant denali didnt see me in my little sebring convertible and I guess he had some emergency or something... whole other story) \n\nBottom Line:\nExpect to wait because the sliders are THAT good. The Barbie was good but not all it was hyped up to be. My favorites were the Eggplant Caprese and the Yaya (feta, tzatziki, white wine vinaigrette).  Sweet potato fries are a must (at least for me...)"
0,"Meh. \n\nIt's ok. \n\nI come here because I work close by. I usually need a grilled chicken breast of sorts. Maybe some vegetables. It's usually because I am too lazy to prepare a proper lunch.\n\nThe thing that sucks about this place is that they usually douse everything in teriyaki sauce which is loaded with sugar, so make sure to get it on the side.\n\nAlso, if you just want the protein, you are still stuck having to spend 6-8 bucks on the whole damn bowl. You can't just buy a side of chicken breast. What an inconvenient truth. Al Gore would not approve.\n\nThere really isn't anything special about this place. It's grilled chicken, beef or salmon over rice. With teriyaki sauce. Big freaking deal. I'd rather make my own lunch.\n\nNEXT!"
0,"I'm not sure why everyone raves about this place...I went with a friend yesterday, and the place was packed! We barely got a parking spot. She had never had pho before, so I wanted to take her to a place that got high reviews so she would have a good experience. The restaurant is very cute, it is in an old house, and is very 'trendy' looking. We were seated and given water and then proceeded to wait for a long period of time before the waiter came around to take our order. When he (finally) did, he was nice enough. We ordered the pork spring roll to share and we each ordered pho ga. I have had fresh rolls before (a lot of them), and this one was just not that great. It was mainly comprised of lettuce, with a little bit of chewy pork bits and a few noodles. Other (more hole in the wall type places...aka authentic) places fill the roll with more of a balance of ingredients. Also, the ends of the fresh roll had very thing rice paper, making it hard to chew and swallow and felt like a piece of rubber in my mouth. Not awesome. So our pho comes out and it looks weird because the broth is clear....almost like water. I have never experienced this before(and I have eaten, and made, a lot of pho). All of the toppings were fresh, but they didn't add enough flavor to save the bland broth. Additionally, the noodles used are thicker, more spaghetti-like noodles than the typical thin rice noodles found in pho. The whole thing was just not flavorful. It felt like the broth was not homemade, and if it was, was missing all of the spices that give it such a unique flavor. To top it off, this place is WAY overpriced. We paid 23$ for lunch, and it wasn't good. I would recommend finding a little whole in the wall pho place in which the employees speak little-to-no English and trying their food. Skip this pretentious 'trendy' spot."
1,"The place is always packed, and for a good reason. The NZ Cafe offers some amazing sushi for a affordable price. You won't leave disappointed. I have tried the Philly roll and I loved it."
0,pretty busy at around 7 AM on a friday... i waited 20 minutes for my drink and they forgot my peppermint! :/  not the best starbucks experience i've had.  BUT they do have a drive-thru.  wonder if that line would have moved faster...
0,"I'm tired of this hotel. Almost everytime I come to Vegas, I end up staying here. I was here this past weekend and service was horrible. I was here with some friends and we asked for towels and an iron and it took at least one hour. We told them we need a room with 2 beds and we only got one the first night. Next night, they told us they will upgrade to a suite and we wind up with a one-bedroom suite. Better stay at Hilton!"
0,"First off let me say this TGIF is gonna get the brunt of a couple of other TGIF visits I've had around the Charlotte area. I'd say i've had a couple of other visits to TGIF's in Charlotte and I don't recall them being a good experience. I kinda forgot that until we headed there on a whim and right away i remembered, ohhhh yea, this place is soooo loud. I'm not talking a little loud, I'm talking scream to place an order or ask your wife sitting next to you what the waiter said. Yep, that loud. \nIt took us about 15 minutes to get seated was what they had advised. The waiter was good and provided really good service (Once we could hear each other). It took another 30-45 minutes to get our food and then another 10-15 to get bill and checked out. Almost 2 hours is way to long for a meal, especially when it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with the others in your party. \nSo I believe over the years i've tried TGIF's 3 times or so and I'm pretty sure this will be the last time. Fool me once shame on you, fool my twice shame on me, fool me three times......."
0,"I used to be a big fan of Nellos but they are really cheapskating these days.   Ordered 2 Extra large pizzas(supposed to be 14\"" but only measures 12\"") for take out.  I guess they measure the crust going up one inch on each side but its the smallest 14\"" pizza Ive ever seen and the pepperoni pizza had very sparse toppings like half of what anyplace else gives.   I still like the taste of the pizza but what a ripoff this place is these days.   Called to complain about my 12\"" pizza after ordering the 14\""s and they told me to order another on if its not enough.   Never again!"
0,"Absolutely the worst servers work here.  Not one person on the service staff is attentive, nor do they have any standards.  We have had repeated service issues, but since the food is generally good (even though you have to wait for a lifetime to get it)  we've put up with it, but after today's experience, we're done!!!!!\n\nMy girlfriend and I ate here for happy hour.  Including us, there were 3 customers in the restaurant.  The bartender who is usually one of the more rude servers sat next to the guy at the bar the entire time we were.  The bartender and this customer were looking things up on the internet.  All the liquor bottles still had the protective paper cones on them.....we didn't know if they were open when we came in cause they place looked closed.  When our food came, we were never asked how things tasted which was unfortunate since one of our entrees wasn't cooked correctly.  My girlfriend was never asked if she wanted another beer (which it was almost completely finished).  My water was refilled surprisingly, but without any ice, so it was room temperature water.\n  \nWe had to ask for our check from the server/bartender who was still on the computer with the one other customer.  Not one time were we asked how was the food, nor were we ever told \""thank you for coming.\""   \n\nI do not recommend this place to anyone if you want a good service experience.  Total joke!!"
1,"Mu Shu is an all time favorite of mine!  I have been going there for about 5 years now - the owner Gary and the staff are all so nice!   The place is like a Mongolian BBQ but 10x better than any one that I've ever been to - the bowls are twice as big, you don't have to touch the meat, it's cheaper and it just tastes fresher!\n\nThe food is delicious and you always have plenty to take home!  Seriously, I can put some food down but I always end up with a full take home box.  \n\nYou should definitely try this place if you haven't!!!"
1,"Reading the reviews below, I was a bit surprised.  I have gone to this same GC for my latest 2 instruments...an acoustic Yamaha guitar and a Fender bass, and in both instances, the help I was given was tremendous.  Both guys I spoke to were musicians, and both were willing to answer any question this relatively new guitar player had.  They guaranteed that their prices would beat anything out there, including on-line.  In fact, they have a computer hooked up there that you can search on to see if someone offers lower prices.  And as a full-time salesman myself, I really valued 2 parts of my experience: 1) both guys sold me guitars that were LESS expensive than the one I thought I wanted when I walked in and 2) they both called me a week after the purchase to see if I was happy with my purchase.  BOTH guys were enthusiastic when talking to me.  I absolutely love going to GC.  Yes, there are times when someone will be in there testing a guitar out, and they might actually be good! That doesn't scare me off...it inspires me to get better.  Man, it's a music store!  And I wouldn't consider myself a young kid...I'm 50 and I dig this place.  (they aren't asking me to write this review...I just know that it's not often when review sites get anything but negative experiences recapped.  Not saying the people below are wrong to express themselves...I'm just saying that it wasn't my experience and this location rocks."
0,"The service was definitely lacking here. I went to happy hour here this afternoon and the waitress, an older lady with dark curly hair was not very personable and rarely checked in on us. Then she made a stink about us wanting to split the check. The restaurant was dead btw so it's not like she has a bunch of other tables to tend to or anything. As we were dining we noticed that every server in the parking lot looked miserable coming in as well and while leaving we heard another guest complain about the bar service."
1,"I have been a fan of Village Inn all my life. This is comfort food at its best. I always love their french toast and pancakes. At this location, the service has been pretty consistent and speedy, even when they're super busy. And everyone is generally nice."
0,"Purchased few bags of potatoes but less than 2 weeks, started smelly and rejected when tried to returned 2 bags. Brought them back home, after tried to segregated to get the good part, at last nothing was left since all the potatoes were rotten and black spot inside even the outside skin looked good. What a rip off selling a very bad quality stuff to customer when all the purchased stuff end up in trash."
0,"I really did not like how the parties are partitioned off by scaffolding. Because there were so many parties going on at the same time AND open jump time the two toilets in there were clearly not enough for the amount of people there and they were hardly cleaned and resupplied. There was no transition from party area to shoe shelves to trampoline, so all the kids were walking all over the cement with their socks and tracking all the filth into the trampolines. Unlike pump it up, the staff was not as professional or helpful. There was not a thing about the place that was impressive, the kids had fun but any kid would have fun with any trampoline."
1,"We were able to enjoy  patio seating on a nice spring night here at Baby Kay's.  Tucked into a nice strip mall area near several other restaurants, boutique shops and Trader Joe's it can also make for a fun outing.   The food here was authentic and flavorful.  The food was spicy but not so much as to loose touch with the flavor of it all.  I could have made a meal out of the seafood gumbo alone but got the 2 item that came with red beans and rice ( I barely touched it I was so full).  My friend got a three item combo and while the portions looked meagar, they filled him up and he was quite pleased.  We didn't quite know what to expect with the green olive coleslaw when we saw it as an option but if you are a green olive fan you will enjoy the mix of tart briney sliced green pimento stuffed olives with the slaw.  I would have liked to try the oyster po' boy, I will have to go back just for that and the slaw."

1,"Coffee was delicious.  I got the light roast with a shot of french vanilla.  I saw another review about poor service but, we came in at 3:30 pm and the one employee I saw working was prompt and friendly.  My wife and I enjoyed it.  It is so nice to see a non-starbucks coffee shop.\n\nNone of those pretentious uber- enlightened unemployed hippies like you see at Starbucks."
0,I so want to like this place. I love their pizza that is naturally thin crust. We used to order it in north Phoenix and decided to do so a couple times since moving. I have noticed that there seems to be 2 franchises and you will only find half of the locations on one site and the other half  on a similar site.  For the myrosatis.com I have yet to have a great experience. We received the wrong order this time and I took us 2 hours to get what we ordered. My fianc\u00e9 keeps telling me to give up on this place. Let's just say we ate in silence tonight. Just noticed that the other rosatis of almost equal distance and different website has much better reviews. If my fianc\u00e9 ever let's us get pizza again from here we will be going to the other one. I still love the pizza and garlic bread. When it is hot.
1,My family and I have been seeing  Dr. Bazilus (Dr. B) for a few years now. He is a great denist and recommend him to all my family and friends. His office manager Deborah is very helpful and sincere.
0,"I hate to go against the grain, but as a true pizza connoisseur, it would be wrong to hold back on this one. For reference I've traveled to NYC many, many times, I lived in Chicago for awhile, I've spent a month in Italy and pizza is my favorite food on earth. If I know anything, it's pizza!! I have never been as disappointed in a slice as I was here. \n\nI do laugh when I read Vegas yelper complaints about brick oven places having \""burnt\"" pizza. In NYC, many order their pizza extra well done and relish in the beautiful black bubbles that a true NYC pizzeria coal fired oven delivers. The crust here was the most bland tasteless cardboard crust I've ever had. I like crust with flavor and this crust had none. It wasn't chewy, it wasn't crispy, it was just blah. \n\nI thought Metro had the greasiest cheese in town until I tried Biaggio's. I've attached a picture of the disgusting pool of orange that oozed out of every bite. I know some are way into the whole grease thing, but I am not. If you're the type that wants neon orange grease dripping down your arms, this is your place. \n\nIn fairness, I did order the lunch special (2 slices and drink for around 5 or 6 bucks), so perhaps the pizza just doesn't reheat well and I should have ordered a fresh pie? Definitely hands down the most tasteless greasy pizza I've ever had (yup, I'm including Sbarro and Little Caesar's in that!). This pizza may be appealing to some, but this isn't anything like the pizza served in NY."
0,"We came to this place for a birthday, the service was incompetent . My guests were disappointed in the food as so was I . Everything was bland. Tapas is small portions and not cheap. Save yourself the trouble and go to pintxo."
0,"Closed.  According to the other shops in the strip center, they had a hard time remembering that in order to stay in business you have to be open when you say you're going to be open."
1,"A solid dive bar. Cheap drinks, close proximity to greasy food, and bartenders with a heavy pour."
0,The last 2 out of 2 times I went here my order was messed up. The girl behind the counter didn't even acknowledge us for a few minutes when we walked in.  She was working on her schedule or something.  My famous star sandwich was just sad looking.  Not very appetizing. I don't think I'll be going back here again.
0,This place is as average of a buffet as it gets.   There are many different places where you can get better food for the same price.
0,"Came, ordered my food, as I was waiting to pay I see the girl making the food change out the trash and not change gloves before making the next persons food.\n\nThe managers at this location aren't worth their salary, they can care less about the location and how it's ran, they're just in it to collect a paycheck."
1,Friday night all you can eat fish fry....ask for it grilled if you prefer!  Be sure to leave room for the homemade pies.  Chicken pot pie is a must try as well!
1,"This pizza is BOMB, period. \n\nIMO, it's kinda cool that it's pretty much a hole in the wall and that they don't advertise it. One of those exclusive things where you have to know about it through word of mouth. Almost as if it were my own little secret.\n\nAs far as for you negative Nancys comparing this plave to NY. Get a grip, it's not New York, it's Las Vegas. You will never get NY pizza anywhere but NY. It's like going to NY to a casino (idk if they have them or not) and say well these arn't like Las Vegas...duuhhh."
1,"Abie's is one of two deli's I know of that still do things right.\n\nThat's to say, the brisket is properly seasoned and smoked, hand sliced. The service I've received while casual is always thorough and down-to-earth. \n\nI'm sorry for Mark G's experience but am also surprised, & wonder if he asked for medium smoked meat sandwich (best meat to fat ratio). I'm sure if he'd commented to the server the sandwich would have been replaced pronto."
0,New Paint doesn't help the food...\n\nI really wanted to like this place. It just moved to right near where I live and I was hoping the food got better with the move. I have twice now gone there and ordered a veggie omelette and asked them to add ham to it. Twice now they have just given me a Denver omelette. On top of that the food has no cooked in flavor it is pretty bland despite having all the ingredients that should make it tasty.
1,"Great, smoky barbecue. The BEST mac 'n' cheese. Good sweet potato fries. All-around good food! The service is a gamble. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it leaves something to be desired. Worth the chance for a great meal and good atmosphere!"
1,"Been eating here for a few years now and doesn't get old! Love this place it's great food. Their lunch specials are filling, cheap and delicious! Beats major chain pizza any day. \n\nPlus their TVs usually have sport on :) - I always get the number 3."
1,"An interesting museum with lots to see! I spent most of my time here browsing outside, in and out of each of the houses that were recreated to represent different times in history. A lot of old time artifacts from the early 1900s, even if you're not interested in specific NV history, its fascinating to take a look back in time. We spent probably about 2 hours here, without really checking out the inside. I would recommend DO NOT go here in the summer time. It will be waaaaay too hot to walk around. I went in January and it was pretty warm, even then! Good times."
1,"Best sullungtang(beef brisket soup) hands down, better than any places in LA. Korean pepper with their own ssamjang(sauce) is also superb. Kimchi is legit. Highly recommended."
1,"I love coming here! The owners are wonderful people who take the time to explain their products. Inta Juice uses the best quality ingredients and that makes all the difference. The smoothies can easily fill you up and keep you satisfied for several hours. Inta Juice also offers a variety of FREE, yes I said Free supplements to add to your drink. \n\nThey have something for every taste here and it's super healthy. My favorite is the Super C drink. Try the fresh wheatgrass juice!"
1,"oooh, so far my most favorite vietnamese restaurant in las vegas.  a friend of mine, who just moved here and is vietnamese, also feels that it's one of the better places here in vegas.  the big steaming hot bowls of pho are all good here.  remember when you eat pho, ask for the plate of vinegered onions.  then you smother them with hoisen sauce and the hot chili sriracha sauce.  so, take in some pho to the mouth and then take a fork full of onions.  ooooh yeahhhh.  also, i have to admit i love the wonton soup here.  you gotta order it with egg noodles.  so hearty with lots of wontons.  deelish!!!  it goes so good with those damn onions on the side too.   they do have a wide selection of sinh to (milkshakes)!  they have my favorite durian shake...it does stink, but it taste like vanilla when you drink it down...so when i'm looking for good vietnamese food, i am usually here if i'm not lazy.  i also always refer people to eat here.  so i do really think it's that good."
0,"This is a complaint we sent to Hilton after a recent stay.\n\nEvery year our charity organization holds a one week camping/whitewater rafting event in Charlotte for teenagers who've survived cancer.  The event was held last week and due to bad weather we were forced to stay in a hotel Friday evening (Aug 1).  We decided on the Hilton Garden Inn Charlotte/Ayrsley.  I felt it would be better to book the accommodations directly through Hilton's 1-800 line rather than using Hotels.com or some other agent.  On Friday morning I spoke to a Hilton agent explaining that I needed 10 rooms and needed to accommodate 4 adults in each room.  He said there was 10 rooms available each with two queen beds.  He proceeded with the reservation stating that we had till 4 pm to cancel.  On Friday evening our group (including 28 teenagers) arrived at the hotel expecting an easy check-in so they could go straight to their assigned rooms, get settled, and then head to the nearby movie theater.  I actually arrived a few minutes ahead of them to get the chick-in process started. Working the desk that evening was Patrick Weis and David Mecchum.  Everything appeared to be going smoothly until I was told that 4 of our 10 rooms only had a king size bed.  I explained to David and Patrick that I was told all the rooms had two queen size beds.  This began the next hour of my time trying to get the issue resolved.\n\nFirst problem, David and Patrick referred me back to Hilton since I made the reservations with them over the phone as if they were an entirely different company.  There was no offer to assist or at a minimum get them on the phone.  So at 8:14 PM I made my first call to Hilton while standing in the lobby of a Hilton hotel which seems absurd.  I reached a representative explained the dilemma and requested a Manager.  I was put on hold and after a frustrating 8 minutes was disconnected.  I then went back to the front desk to see if Patrick and David had an easier way to reach Hilton Customer Service and they said no and saying that I needed to call them myself.  So at 8:30 I started my second call.  After reaching a representative, requesting a Manager, and then waiting on hold I finally was put in touch with Nadia Steaks.  My request was that Hilton provide rooms free of charge to accommodate the 8 of us who did not have rooms and provide our group with free breakfast.  Nadia placed me on hold and called the front desk speaking to David.  It seemed absurd again that I was on hold while their phone call took place in front of me.  I had just gotten Hilton to call David instead of him offering to do it for me.  After quite a long hold time Nadia finally got back to me with a resolution.  She was providing us with 4 additional rooms for free, but she couldn't offer a free breakfast because it was David's decision to do so.  We ended the call and David was processing the additional four rooms.  I enquired about offering our group free breakfast and he said that Hilton had already exceeded their allowance for this issue. \n \nThe reason I'm writing is because this doesn't exactly fall into exceptional customer service.  A problem that was created by Hilton in the first place was resolved but meanwhile I had to spend nearly an hour plus of aggravation to get it done.  My time and effort has a value.  Plus I had a large group of teenagers miss their movie because of the delay.  For a company who prides itself on being in the category of other exceptional companies it left us very disappointed, especially when we had just spent ~$1300 to stay at the hotel.  Both David's and Patrick's  attitudes weren't that of helpful representatives.  They were more like taking a \""it's not my problem\"" stance which wasn't helpful.  Any, I'd like to give you an opportunity to make this right.  As the decision maker of which hotel we stay at next year's event I'd like to give you the opportunity to convince me that it should be a Hilton again.\n----------------------\n\nThis is the reply we received back from Hilton.\n\n\nThank you for the feedback about your recent stay.  We are very sorry your experience did not offer you the quality of service you deserve.  We strive to give exceptional service every day, for every guest; I sincerely apologize for falling short during your stay.  At Hilton Garden Inn, we promise to do whatever it takes to ensure you are satisfied. We hope you will consider staying with us in the future.  You Can Count On Us.  Guaranteed.\n\nSincerely,\n \nRory Pagdanganan\n Front Office Manager\n Hilton Worldwide\n rory.pagdanganan@hilton.com\n 7049705000\n----------------------\n\nObviously, they don't think their customer's time and effort is worth anything more than fixing a problem they created.  Hilton does not go above and beyond."

1,"I died and went to heaven the first day I ate there!  Please, be adventurous and try something different!  This place should be in every city in every state- in my opinion!  The menu is diverse as heck in regards to everything you can do with peanut butter!  I like how they specialize meals for kids and how they serve animal crackers as a side (whereas another place would give you fries or potato chips).  My heart seriously skips a beat when I see this place on the horizon!"
0,Don't Do It! My hubby and I decided to check this place out thinking it must be pretty chill considering they pass out wristbands to get in everywhere you walk around in the Monte Carlo..figured it would be fun with chill people looking to have fun without the vegas bullshit and thought it was free it get in.  We could not believe we were charged $20 each to get in and I was promised two free drinks and my hubby 1. As we ordered our drinks they gave me a pink glass and my hubby a regular and the bouncer would come over and tell my hubby he could not hold or drink from my cup..are you kidding?!?! You just charged us 40 bucks to get into this dive and you won't even let us drink what we want!!! We were SO out of there..what a waste of money and time..will never return and I would NOT recommend!
1,"If you like gelato, Angel Sweet is a go to place.\n\nThey offer several dozen different flavors of gelato that change on a regular basis."
1,"Caf\u00e9 Gourmand is the latest acquisition of the area, I presume. It's been here for the past 2 or 3 months. It's a little caf\u00e9 on Nicolson Street that offers a French menu, from breakfast to desserts, soup of the day, coffee and more. \n\nOne thing I love about the area (Newington) is its diversity, there's a bit of everything: Thai, Indian, Malaysian, Sudanese, Tex-Mex, Italian and now French. This may be ambitious for a tiny caf\u00e9 with a limited menu -among other established coffee places in the same block. However, I can see the potential of this caf\u00e9 and I do hope it becomes a serious contender in the area. And to do so, it already has one essential thing: it's real food! On top of that, it serves something different and, if that was not enough, it's French! \n\nThis coffee shop serves full breakfast ('til noon on weekdays and all day during the weekend), soups, sandwiches, hot sandwiches (like croque monsieur), cr\u00eapes and desserts and all sorts of beverages. The menu apparently changes every week or so (I've been twice in the past 5 days, need to go back in a week or so). In my two visits I've tried their onion soup, and potato, spinach and nutmeg soup. And both were delicious! I've had their spinach and mushroom cr\u00eape and the popular croque monsieur. Both really really good. Must say that I could easily stick to cr\u00eapes (because I love them and there are several savoury and sweet options) but I went for the croque monsieur with the intention of basing my review on two different dishes. There are also several options for dessert (croissants, cakes, muffins, all look quite tasty) but I've only had the macarons (pistachio and vanilla) and both were amazing! One of the staff girls said they bring them from France, so there you go... great stuff! \n\nI wish I could say more about its menu but as I said, I've only been twice. Yet, I'm thinking of a good excuse to go back again and try something new. I'm really looking forward to having breakfast here and, even though it's not good to have any expectations, I presume it'll be good. Will see... \n\nI can't give Caf\u00e9 Gourmand the highest mark just because it's quite new and some things can still be improved (the atmosphere of the place, for instance). Of course, this is totally comprehensible having opened quite recently. Yet, it's clear to me that their real bet is on the food they serve and this already speaks for the people running the caf\u00e9 and what truly matters, quality food. Bonne chance and... bon appetit!"
1,"We were in Scottsdale for a long weekend found this place via Yelp.  Indulge had good ratings and lived up to them.  Cool menu concept let's you fill out your own order from a menu they provide.  Top quality beef and ingredients are put together well. Food is very good.  Service was better, we were greeted immediately and the staff was all very attentive. The owner, Len, a former Chicagoan himself was there and very friendly. The prices were great.  We really liked Indulge and recommend it."
0,"I've eaten at a lot of fine dining establishments during my time living in Vegas, and Olives is by far the worst, and one of only two restaurants that I refuse to go back to (the other being Prime, located just up the mall from Olives).  \n\nWhere to begin? First, our party of three arrived for our 8:00pm reservation a few minutes early, and had to wait until about 8:30pm before we were seated -- strike 1.  We ventured to the bar to wait, where I decied I'd try one of their speciality cocktails they were offering for the night - except not, because they were out -- strike 2.  When we were finally seated, we were crammed into a crowded, loud, dark corner where we could barely move -- strike 3. \n\nTo expand, the atmosphere and ambiance of Olives is awful.  They have crammed way too many tables into their already cramped dining room, for no other reason than because they can, I would suppose.  The wait staff is constantly bumping into the backs of chairs and are forced to reach in front of you to accomplish even the simplest tasks.  A side effect of the crowded dining room is the noise.  Even at a small table, you can forget about conversation unless you feel like losing your voice from shouting by the end of your meal (I'm exaggerating, but this place is WAY too loud for a high-end restaurant).  The lighting is ineffective, and the tables are so dark that you can barely see what you're eating - this is not necessarily a bad thing, because the food was so overly complex, that it failed on just about every level.  Yet another restaurent that fails because of what I like to call 'Top Chef Syndrome' - leave the campy molecular gastronomy, overly complex sauces, and useless garnishes to the few professionals that do it well, and get back to the basics of just cooking your food well.\n\nEverything (with the exception of the osso buco, which was the only highlight of the meal) was just not up to par with a restaurant of this reputation and price.  Our meal for three was close to $600 - apparently we gambled, and lost, on this one.  I wouldn't go back here even if someone else was paying."
0,"This place is so unprofessional. They employees have no manners and talk about their personal business very loudly. One of the employees told another that she was going to \""stick her food up her a$$ if she didn't give her the right paper work\"", another talked about her boyfriend in prison. After signing in I waited 45 mins for them just to get my insurance information. After that I waited another 30 mins to get my blood work. I don't mind the wait, I understand they have a lot of paper work but there was only two people before me. I just find it very uncomfortable to hear yelling across the office and it's all personal conversations. Very disappointed with the staff. Will never come back here."
1,It's delicious food and great atmosphere. I prefer to sit at the bar than at the tables. It's definitely the perfect spot in Southern Highlands. I recommend asking about the secret menu. Pretty bomb dishes off there. And the cheesecake is amazing!!
1,The chicken comes in huge proportion compared to the price! please do check it out with an empty stomach.
1,"Food, juices and smoothies are always great! Today, my order wasn't what I expected and the young lady who brought my food was sincere and said she would bring out what I though I ordered. When my new order was ready, the lady who took my order came out to check on things and I apologized for the confusion. As she walked away she looked at me and said that she is sure I ordered wrong. Really...My friend and I each spent $20 with a small tip and that comment is acceptable how?"
1,"This is a partially covered street that feels like a movie from the 60s in a weird way. The half arches that stretch over the sidewalk are clear plastic and cast a strange light whether the sun shines through them or they are covered in snow. It's predominantly crammed with prom and wedding dresses of the $49.99 variety, plus some big second hand stores, and super inexpensive shoes and tops. And there are hidden nuggets of gold - CFC (formerly Zoobizarre) for late night cavernous dancing; Delices du Terroir for local beers and cheeses and yumminess, Oscars, some great coffee and smoked meat, Plaza St Hubert for cool live shows - lots to love if you take the time and keep an open mind."
1,Going bar hopping can lead to disasterous events...like a major hang-over or a 1500.00 tab...wonder which one is worst...luckily- the latter was comped off for 'mistakenly' ordering a 'bottle' of Cristal...a little too rico suave for me... and too many women with clandestine intentions....but hey if you're a rockstar- you'll be a big hit ;-)
0,"Went to enjoy a beer and some pub food.... great selection in beer but the food was terrible. Had, what I thought, traditional fish and chips. Terrible! Fries were over cooked and cold. Fish cold. Advised the waitress the issue .. she took the plate back and had it reheated. Stuffed the lemon wedge in the coleslaw so the lemon would not get hot!. Really pathetic. Did not replace the fries nor fish. Came back and really overdone now.  Will not go back again."
1,Just had the El Pastor Burro for lunch. Definitely worth the drive from North Scottsdale.
1,"Free wifi, cool atmosphere in a super artsy building, and the open mic is AMAZING if you want to see some entertainment in Vegas without all the feather and sequins. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)\n\nThe sandwich I had was, well, underwhelming. I ordered the \""Slap and Tickle\"" which is PB and J with jalapeno peppers and bacon. It was on special that day so maybe they were skimping on ingredients, because it wasn't as crazy as I was expecting. That being said, I got that and a beer for $4, and you can't go wrong.\n\nDon't miss this place!"
0,This rating is just for the $5.47 milk shakes. I was told by two people that they are really good and i was horribly disappointed. I kept my composure through half before it went in the trash. I cant remember the last time i threw food away until now.
0,"Dr. Powell is great. We have been going there for 7 years and now considering switching. It is taking a long time for any appointments. This office is near Intel and is one of the few accept Intel's insurance, making this a very popular office to stop by. In addition, Dr. Powell is on vacation quite frequent, so leaving limited space for appointment. My kid's glass broke, her prescription also expired and we were not able to make an eye exam in 2 weeks, so we had to go to Target. Later, it happened couple times with emergent issues where appointment goes beyond 3 weeks. It seems that they do not care about their patients and tell me either wait of go to other places. I am OK to wait on normal exams, but with sudden problems, they are not accommodating."
0,"Just visited today 05/31/14. The business has changed owners. The service is substandard. The staff is not friendly and they are not familiar with coney dogs at all.\n\nThe staff are the kids of the owner and it shows. They sigh if you ask for refills, sigh when you as for the bill and are not even familiar with their revised menu.\n\nI will NOT be returning there anymore. If you are the owner reading this, you have lost my business."
1,"Love this place! Seriously, the best raised donut ever. I wish my diet would allow me to indulge more often because I would be here every weekend."
0,"This is where there should be an option for a negative star review. I purchased some pizza for my family they got the order wrong and LATE BY AN HOUR, They sort of apologize for it and then gave me credit for free pizza next order. Few weeks later I went to use that free pizza offer and was given the third degree by the management, supposedly, they questioned me over and over to put me on hold for a while came back stating that they couldn't find any information on this in the time I sure and then they gave me what sounded like some sarcasm I let them know that I didn't need this BS and I'd be going elsewhere and it wasn't about the money. I've never felt like a low life trying to get something for free as I did when I contacted this establishment. I didn't even like the pizza before I ordered it, but the people in my group were raving about their crust and other specialties so I figured I'd give him another chance... Boy do they know how to blow off a second chance customer. Since then, it's been a few months, our pizzas have been ordered from other establishments regardless of what the people in the group want. To hell with our needs no more bad customer service for us no matter what the cost they may have the best pizza ever now but it's not worth being made to feel like they're doing us a favor."
1,"Madison, WI is not necessarily known as the epicenter of great Mexican food. However, Casa de Lara is a solid option if you are really craving some. While the service won't knock your socks off, everyone is nice and the food is pretty darn delicious. \n\nInsider tip: Try one of their margaritas. Then have another. Repeat this process until you leave with a smile on your face."
0,"The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is the guy taking my to go order was really nice & helpful. Otherwise it was a pretty expensive meal to feed the dogs although they seemed to enjoy it. Ordered 3 entrees, explained that i was vegan so NO animal products including fish sauce, egg or even honey. Listed exactly what I wanted for the pad Thai- noodles, scallions & bean sprouts only, pad see ew with vegetables and panning curry with veggies. It was wrapped up securely for the drive home so it wasn't til I got home & started plating the food that I saw that the noodle dishes both were full of veggies & scrambled egg. Plus I've never seen pad Thai sauce that is bright orange & really sticky. I didn't try the panang but SO didn't eat more than 2 bites & his description of the panning & pad Thai was \""horrible\"". I should have read more reviews, Xuankieu was so right."
1,"I love this place! Reminds me of SF! So happy to see the change in Las Vegas with new quality eats, serving quality food. Don't forget to try the ginger lemonade and prosciutto sandwich... They are delicious and reasonably priced (hard to find when eating healthy in LV) Easily one of my new favorite lunch spots in town!"
0,"This was possibly some of the worse food I have ever ATTEMPTED to eat.! OMG, for shame that the Sunday buffet was $19.95 for CRAP! There was nothing there that was tolerable. It was a complete waste of money.\n\nWe stopped @ the M buffet on Sunday morning but they stopped serving weekend breakfast buffet in March. So we dropped into the South Point because it was closest.\n\nThe selection was very limited for a $20 brunch  buffet. The regular fare for breakfast eggs, omelets, bacon, etc all of which were terrible. Eggs over medium was runny egg whites, eggs Benedict was cold & lacked any flavor, sausage was \""hockey puck\"" tough, all the steam table food was way way over cooked and lifeless.\n\nThere is SO much more but I think you get the picture. The thing that really makes me crazy is that I could have gone anywhere else and for the money had a superior product.\n\nMy advise is don't stop here, it will disappoint"
1,"This was a great mall! There was a great  combination of Extremely pricey stores and nice budget items!  The food court has many things to choose from and it was very well lit, clean and friendly atmosphere.  It seems like you could spend more than one day looking at everything there."
1,"This review is for the Xtreme Couture MMA camp.  Randy Couture hosts these camps about twice per year and they are limited to 40 people.  My significant other recently attended the camp and had nothing but positive things to say about the experience.  Not only did he receive instruction from top trainers, but Randy also provided the attendees with coaching and took the time to talk to every one in the class.  I watched a couple of the sessions and was amazed at how large and clean the gym area is.  I have been inside several MMA gyms and most are much smaller and don't always smell so great.  Not only is the gym extremely nice, but Randy Couture seems to be a class act.   He definitely wants to go back for another session.\n\nAdditional note--the gym also sells punch cards that allow people who are just visiting the area to drop in and train."
0,"\""Eek! Methinks not\"" is RIGHT! (one star because we couldn't go lower)\nI'm writing this as my family and I are cracking up in horror, disbelief, and embarrassment.  We saw the show an hour ago and can't stop making fun.  We were so NOT entertained, the only way to make it worth our money is to laugh our asses off at how incredibly stupid and awkward this show was.  We had a party of 12 people and here's what each said:\n9 year old boy #1:  I thought it would be more magical.  Is the fiance from Hooters?\n9 year old boy #2:  My teenage cousin is better at magic in our living room. Laaaa--        aaaaaame!\n10 year old girl: The show was more about HIM than him doing magic. I wanted to                     put a paper bag over my head.  Not that the person himself stinks, he just stinks at magic...\n11 year old girl: Are we at the right show? \n12 year old girl:  I'm ashamed of/for the mother (aka DJ M-O-M also dressed like Hooters girl).\n12 year old boy: The mom looks like a hooker and the fiance IS a hooker (and we didn't even know he knew the word hooker)\n14 year old boy: It was good huhuhuhuhuhuh\n16 year old boy:  Mom, if you EVER wore that...\nmom #1: Why in God's good name would we want to see him lip sync an Elvis song while waltzing down the aisle shaking hands like an actual performer? Or play the drums with his one-tune dad?  He was AVOIDING magic.  \nmom#2: The finger snapping is awkward and creeping me out.  The stage manager looks mortified and MUST be a cousin working to earn his keep.  I was uncomfortable.\ndad#1: Tommy Wind is magic's answer to the Wolf of Wall Street. Goooooooooong\ndad #2: no comment (in fear of bad karma...)\n\nWe simply could not make eye contact at the end.  Meet and greet--me thinks NOT. We're too ashamed. \n\nOn a serious note, the positive reviews either have to be from friends and family, or we saw an extremely OFF night...For some constructive criticism--Tommy Wind's passion for show business is nice.  Hopefully, he will perfect some tricks (we could see some of the tricks we shouldn't have seen) and focus more on magic than the music portion.  We paid less for the Nathan Burton show last year and it was very good, so we expected some good illusions and slight of hand. Also, It's nice to work with family, but maybe he can work on integrating the family stories more smoothly."
0,Service was awful. I tried Tuesday special Pastie; it was horrible and way overpriced. Not a true northern Michigan pastie. Very small portion with roast beef and celery which are not ingredients in a traditional pastie.\n\nSkip this place for lunch .
0,"First: The food tastes all right, albeit very salty. However, after eating here for some time I had to stop. Unsure if it's the salt content or the amount of processed ingredients, but I feel terrible after eating here. \nWhich is sad, because I have a soft spot for the po'boy.\n\nSum up: if you don't mind indulging in junk food that's still vegan, this is a good place. It's convenient, it's fast, and it's pretty relaxed. \nBut if you're looking for something nutritious and clean, there are other places."
0,"Have you ever been wrongly judged by a retail salesperson who is just standing around in the show room doing absolutely nothing other than waiting to take a turn in their up system rotation???\n\nThis review is for Sean.\n\nI walked in to look at a Hublot watch and not only did Sean reluctantly take the watch out of the case (after sizing me up and wrongly determining that I was not able to buy a Hublot watch), but he had the audacity to ask me if I was really going to come back when I asked him for his card!!! Similarly to the Pretty Woman principle, I walked out of that store and thank God I got my Rolex elsewhere, O Yeah Sean, it's because I CAN afford a good watch."
0,I enjoyed playing there. Staff was friendly. We played the first tee time out so we where able to play fast but when we where finished the course was packed. I will go back because its economical to play.
0,"Another all you can eat sushi place here in Henderson.  I love sushi especially all you can eat sushi.  I've been here a couple times, but I haven't really liked the food that much.  They give each sushi with too much rice, the little secrets to help fill a person up.  There's a descent amount of selections to choose from here though which is cool, but the fish didn't quite taste as fresh as some other places.  I wish the service was just a bit better, but a couple times were busy, so I understand.  However, one time one of the chefs did give a bit of an attitude when my friend ordered a second helping of ice cream since that's all you can eat too.  He asked, \""Does anyone ELSE want ice cream too before I have to go back and scoop it up again?\""  Weird.  It's just not my favorite place to go for all you can eat sushi."
0,"Garbage. This airline sucks so bad. Didn't read the reviews of this place until after I had already dealt with them. The reviews are true. Spirit airlines is terrible. Sitting here waiting for my flight that has been delayed due to \""maintenance.\"" Oh god.. Not the best thing to hear before you get on a plane."
1,"6/8/12\n\nAll that we tried from here were simply terrific!  If our next visit is just as great as our first, I'm sure I wouldn't have a problem bumping my rating up to five stars.  :)  So, why not give five stars outright?  I'd have to say it was due to my slight disappointment in the atmosphere...\n\nWe came in and were immediately greeted by the cashier at the counter, which was situated right in front of the entrance and to the right of the pastry display cases.  The coffee preparation area is behind and to the right of the cashier.  All of this served to show just how busy the staff members were: the pastry chefs working in the back, who would come out to deliver fresh-baked goodies and refill the cases, the cashier taking orders at the counter, a couple of people manning the coffee area (preparing espressos, lattes, mochas, and French presses, just to name a few), and a few more going in and out of the kitchen preparing sandwiches and other items.  This gave the place a bistro feel.  I suppose I was expecting a little more laid-back and romantic cafe, with an in-house bakery in the back- I quickly got over it.  Amelie's is a patisserie with a cafe attached to it.  We sat ourselves at the set of love seat, chairs, and coffee table across from the cashier and the bakery's entrance, so for the most part of our meal, my views of the pastry cases and the rest of the cafe were blocked by lines of people ordering and paying at the cashier-- not conducive to a relaxing breakfast/brunch.  I kept wishing there was a wood panel screen between our table and the traffic of people to give us some privacy.  \n\nSince Mom and sis had no idea of what to order, I decided to start us out with some coffee and chocolate croissants.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA#HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA  Everyone wanted coffee, including me, but I also wanted to try AFB's mocha, so I ordered a large French press (serves 3 or 4) and a mocha latte.  I expected traditional style croissants, so AFB's slightly disappointed me presentation-wise, but as long as the pastries taste delicious, I don't mind, and these croissants were terrific, and they also kept well for the next two days through our vacay in FL.  Among the boxed pastries we took to go http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw#9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw, I really loved the eclairs, which also kept well.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bite through the outer bread layers to find the chocolate filling; It was amazingly creamy and light, yet not fluffy (I don't do fluffy), and the eclairs stayed fresh through numerous times of refrigeration and thaws.  My sis enjoyed her bites of one salted caramel brownie, but interestingly enough, didn't eat the rest of it, nor touch the second one.  They seemed very rich...  I also enjoyed the Napoleon's crunch and buttercream-textured custard filling, but for fear of clogged arteries, I think I'll stay away from now on.  :)\n\nAs for the savory selections, sister and Mom absolutely LOVED the chicken salad sandwich!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw#TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw  Mom and  I really enjoyed the ham and gruyere tartine-- I loved the crunch of the toasted baguette and thought the saltiness of the cheese and ham paired well with the sweet-goodness of my mocha and croissant.\n\nYes, we've all decided to make AFB our first stop from the airport on our trips back to the Queen City!\n\np.s.  Amelie's is open 24/7!"
0,I take back what I said about II Vinao being mismanaged.  I guess they where just having an off day.  The owner contacted me wanting details so that all problems could be fixed.  How great is that?  We will definitely be dropping by again sometime soon.  This place has what it takes to get a 5 star review from me I'm sure of it...I'll make sure to keep everyone posted.
0,"This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to.\n\nYes, there ARE better McD's out there. Like the one on Boulder Highway by Joker's Wild, right before you hit Warm Springs.\n\nI have visited the last two nights here....Because I was picking up a friend of mine who got off from work, and we had a sweet tooth.....along with my family members at the house.\n\nYesterday, we pull up and ask for hot fudge sundaes. \nIce cream machine is out.\n\nInstead, we get two large sweet teas.....Which were overly sweet. Almost...gave off a syrup feel after I swallowed.\n\nTonight, the ice cream machine IS working, so I get two sundaes, and of course, two large sweet teas.\n\nSundaes look sad, because they are not in their proper clear plastic cup...they are instead in mini McFlurry cups....(not even filled completely, might I add.)\n\nMy friend and I take one sip of our sweet teas....and they taste like dirty water.\nIt's almost like they were trying to trick us.....Like, they didn't have enough tea, so they filled 3/4 of the cup with water.... Seriously, if I wanted the taste of unfiltered water, I would just pick up a hose out of someone's back yard. \n\nThe women who work here, hate their lives. I mean, they are just wretched.\nOne of the cars parked by the drive thru was.....vandalized with shaving cream, and what appeared to be eggs... Can't say I blame the perpitrator when these ladies can't even pour a glass of tea. .....I don't condone it, but hey, some people are crazy about their food."
1,"My wife and I have now visited Flora on several occasions.  We have tried several different types of coffee, sandwiches, breakfast and desserts.  This is my go to spot before the movies so I can smuggle in some treats.  The owners are extremely nice here and we strongly believe in support for local business.  We hope to see Flora here for years to come.  We'll take Flora over Starbucks any day!"
1,"Following in the cirque due solei tradition. \""O\"" managed to captivate the audience with its amazing acrobatics with the aquatic twist. Storyline lacked but then again, it was in French. Balcony seating easy okay, just make sure you don't sit immediately by the isle (view may be obstructed). If youve already seen Le R\u00e8ve (non cirque), dont bother to see this unless you want to complete your cirque du solei show checklist."
1,"I stayed here with family visiting from Europe so it was important to be close to Times Square and the metro and I was impressed with the cleanliness and space available to us. The bathrooms were clean and he room service was pretty prompt bringing extra towels and soap, etc. The store had already closed by time we returned to the hotel but one at the concierge went out of his way to find me a bottle of water for the evening. He was extremely polite and did not have to go out of his way so late. I would recommend this hotel for the staff, the beautiful lobby, and location."
1,"The coffee was fine but not spectacular, and pricey although obviously you'll suck it up because you must have something to sip on alongside your yummy treats. I'd say the cardamom bun is reason alone to make it over here, but there's also plenty of nice dense rye breads and crisp crackerbread, fresh sandwiches, and lots of other enticing goodies. The space is bright and glassy, and there are a few comfy couches and a long communal table to sit and read. During the day you might like to stay a while, they even have a basket of blankets to keep yourself warm."
0,"I really shouldn't have expected much, but here is my review anyway.  Coming from SF, where there are creperies everywhere, I guess that I've just been spoiled by good crepes- and Crazy Crepes just didn't cut it.\n\nThe crepe was soggy, the fillings were meager, and overall, just \""meh.\""  I had the strawberry custard with chocolate and it did not satisfy my dessert craving.  At just about $6, it's not really a deal either.\n\nNotes:\n-They serve milk tea also."
1,"Though the food is slow to come out of the kitchen, it is definitely worth the wait.\nStarted with the fried chicken appetizer. Bite sized dark meat marinated in ginger and soy and then deep fried.\n\ni had the Kiki burger which was cooked perfectly and the combo of the onion marmalade, gruyere cheese and bacon were wonderful. The garlic aioli is to die for. \n\nMy wife had the blue green burger protein style (no bun) which though pricey was grass fed beef. She really liked it!!! We also shared salt and pepper fries but to me they were pedestrian at best.\n\ndon't look at the menus on the whiteboards as they don't change it frequently and they didn't have most of the items that were listed. Stick to the menus the servers bring you.\n\nwith an Asian Flair, this makes for a different burger place. Definitely worth going back too."
1,I loved the salmon and my bf liked it also .
0,"Absolutely, without a doubt, THE GROSSEST excuse for sushi I have ever attempted to consume...\nPlease, God, remind me the next time that I'm in a hurry and craving sushi, to head to the freakin grocery store!\nThe rice was oddly wet and smooshed down (I could barely detect that it was rice), the seaweed was mushy, wet and stringy, and my tempura shrimp roll was the size of a woman's fist. \nThe whole experience (if one could call it that) was deplorable...\nThe woman did give me my money back after I took the slop up to the counter, but oh, my God, I can't get that foul taste out of my mouth....\nWhat was I thinking?"
1,"Delicious unlimited freshly baked rolls with honey cinnamon butter!!!  \n\nThat is all the reason you need to go to this restaurant.  Just for the rolls and butter.\n\nPlus you can peel peanuts and throw the shells on the floor, how fun is that!?\n\nThe service is good and the entrees are consistently pretty tasty.  The entrees are not culinary works of art, but this is a good place for a quick, casual steak."
1,"Great place for breakfast in Verdun. You can't really go wrong with a $5 breakfast that includes two eggs, toast, fruits, beans, and coffee. It's not fancy, but the food is great for the price. The waitresses are always super nice."
1,"Somehow my windshield got cracked in March, and I took it to a Safelite location in Chicago to be repaired.  Three months later, the \""repaired\"" 3-inch crack hatched a new crack that extended about two feet across the passenger side of my car.  I was a bit miffed, and put off replacing it because my view from the driver's seat wasn't obstructed and I didn't feel like spending money on my car.  I finally caved in and made an appointment with the Safelite on Neil.  The online appointment system was easy to use, and I got a call from an insurance claim adjustor within an hour of making the appointment.  I got a second call from the Champaign Safelite shortly after that to confirm my appointment. \n\nOn the day of my appointment, I was told I could bring my car in early and they could start working on it.  When I dropped my car off, I asked the technician (I can't remember his name) to scrape off the city sticker from my old windshield so that I could take it to my town's city hall to request a replacement.  When I came back a few hours later, my car was parked out front, all of the windows were clean, the interior was vacuumed, and my old city sticker was stuck to my new windshield (I don't know how he got it off in one piece!).  I paid the price that I was quoted on the website and drove away happy. \n\nI hope that the new windshield will stay crack-free and that I won't have any reason to go back here anytime soon.  However, I had a very positive experience and I highly recommend this Safelite location."
0,"Uh, i guess froyo hasn't caught on in the Great White North yet b/c this place was so crowded and the yogurt was just ok. But that is b/c i've experienced much better in the US. \n\nI would say this is just your regular fro-yo joint and the reason for the low stars is b/c the yogurt machines were pretty dirty. Lots of spillage and some litter on the floor. The staff needs to do a better job with the cleaning."
0,"$53 for Sunday dinner. I've been wanting to eat here and my family finally took me on my birthday. The only thing worth talking about was the lamb. It was amazing. Everything else was mediocre. No ones been posting recent photos of the food and I think after it was dubbed the #1 buffet in Vegas, it let go of itself. What happened to the French macaroons, crazy gelato flavors, fresh honey from the honeycomb and all the other goodies ppl have been boasting about? I feel hella cheated. As for the the chefs, I feel bad for them. Some ppl just don't have common sense. Idk how many times the chefs have told ppl to stop eating on the line and to take the plates with the food they literally transferred onto their personal plate via their hands. Smh* ppl!"
1,"What a great new addition! This place carries all the fine things in life: art, coffee, and sweets! It's a brand new gallery on Selwyn that caters to the caffeine and sweet tooth crowds.\n\nThey have a few tables outside or lots of spaces to choose from inside. I think the chairs on the inside are so fun and creative! Each sitting area offers ample seating and they are all sectioned off really well. The work is done by local artists (e.g., paintings, jewelry, and pottery). They also offer free WiFi...add this place to your list of \""places to do work.\"" \n\nThe employees are very friendly, which adds to the overall warm atmosphere. Tizzerts provides the yummy desserts...the carrot cake is delicious!\n\nCome check this new art gallery/coffee shop out and support the local artists!"
1,Nice views of the waterfall and golf course. We were there for brunch and the food was up to par. It wasn't super busy when we went so the atmosphere was relaxing and just over all a great time. Almost made me think that I wasn't in Vegas while at the restaurant.
0,"I have been to this place twice. The first experience was not that bad so I decided to go back with a different group of friends on a wednesday. Not only their martinis are PURE JUICE but the service is horrendous! Besides the fact that there is only ONE bar attendant on their SPECIAL NIGHT, the \""so called\"" owner (i hope he really is not because someone who have the minimum experience on how to run a place cannot treat their customers like this) made us wait for ever for a table and yelled at us because we sat down at a table that was not cleaned just yet from the last customers that (mind you) left more than 30 mins ago... terrible place to have a chill night...or any night."
1,Honestly as a former chef. This places is one of the hidden gems in Vegas. The food is some of the best I've had. And the prices are really affordable.
1,Trend Vape Is without a doubt the best vape shop around. They have such a wide selection of e-juice! The staff is also so very helpful. I will def be back!
1,"Yun Nan is a wonderful Sichuan restaurant.  Great selection of flavorful and spicy dishes...more delicious and authentic than any Chinese restaurant on the strip, and inexpensive too!\n\nThe best dishes we ordered at Yun Nan:\n\nMapo Tofu\nDan Dan Mien\nSalt and Pepper Shrimp\n\nThe mapo tofu was one of the best I've ever had, great flavor, perfectly spicy and just great dish here.  The Dan Dan Mien was also delicious with sesame paste, pork, and noodles.  The salt and pepper shrimp was very addicting...we ordered two plates of all three dishes.\n\nThis place is great for large groups, service is friendly, and is one of the best cheap eats in Vegas."
1,"Not sure what to rate this so I'll give it a 4.  Mandalay Bay is terrific - pool is amazing, one of the best on the strip.  The restaurants are good - Rum Jungle always a good bet (check out the fire pit).  \n\nThis time we stayed at \""The Hotel\"" which is Mandalay Bays newest addition.  Its very similar to the W hotels - somewhat trendy & meant for upscale business travelers.  Problem is that its such a far cry from the rest of Mandalay Bay (and Vegas) that we had a bit of culture shock every time we went to our room.  It was definitely cold and unfriendly compared to the other resorts around.  The rooms are all suites, which seem to be a growing trend in Vegas (according to our numerous cab drivers.)  Lighting in the rooms were terrible - ladies, good luck applying makeup - men, best of luck shaving!  \n\nI'd give Mandalay Bay a 5 but \""The Hotel\"" just a 2."
1,"Glass of wine with a trio of bruchetta: Salami & Manchego with Pesto, Fresh Mozzarella & Vine-Ripened Tomatoes with Basil, Warm Brie & Apples... what a lovely way to start the afternoon.  We decided to sit inside there was still a bit of chill in the air. Service was great and very friendly. Our sommelier \""accidentally\"" poured us an extra glass of wine (Susana Balbo Crios, Torrontes). I was not about to complain. Great flavors were making me smile. \n\nMy sister had a panini, and seemed to thoroughly enjoy it. (POOF! the panini was gone.) Definitely coming back again."
0,"We went here for dinner around 6. It was kind of confusing where to go and how to order until I asked someone. I feel that all of these restaurants (Joe's BBQ, Joe's Farm grill and here) are a little unorganized until you get the hand of it. We waited in line for about 15-20 minutes.\nI had ordered their burger of the week which was a Philly cheese steak burger with the garlic smashed potatoes, and my husband ordered the 6 alarm burger with fries.\nThe Cheese Steak Burger was very yummy, although it lacked the cheese steak flavor I was looking for. The potatoes were to die for!!!! I love some garlic mashed potatoes, but these were probably one of the best I've ever had.\nMy husband love hot food. He is the guy you see adding hot sauce to everything!!! Well he said that this was almost too hot for him! He took his first few bites and his eyes went wide with delight, then after letting the heat settle in, he realized how hot it truly was. His fries were not that good. He had said he would rather have fast food fries. I tried them and I was disappointed as well. They were cold and didn't have much flavor to them.\nBy the time we left we were both super full. We usually share a meal, but wanted to try  the things we wanted for our first time there. \nThe one thing I will say is that we had to run to the bathroom when we got home.... Im not sure why, but the food didn't settle well. But boy did it taste good!!\n\nA day later, I'm regretting every delicious bite. My husband and I had been sick all day =("
1,"Came here on a Sunday morning for brunch with a friend.  I've been wanting to try this place since I saw it featured on Phoenix Mag.  \n\nEVERYTHING looked and sounded incredible. I probably took 30 mins to finally decide what to get.  Ended up getting the tofu scramble served with summer veggies, vegan chedder cheese, fruit and buttered toast.  Devoured the whole dish! So tasty!!!!! Large portions, very healthy and all homemade.  Can't get any better than that. The food was so fresh and tasted amazing--great seasoning!  The best part is that Pomegranate Cafe is a daughter/mother/grandma team. How cute is that?! I can't wait to go back and try their lunch menu.  The dessert case also left me drooling.\n\n** In regards to complaints on here about the service, I did not experience any problems.  Food did not take too long and came out hot and steamy.\n\nDefinitely try this place. You will not be disappointed!"
1,"The first time I walked into this place I noticed the anthropomorphic hot dog wearing tennis shoes and maniacally squirting ketchup on himself.  I was already in love with the place.\n\nThis is not food for skinny chicks who lament on how much of \""x, yz, z\"" they ate and expect me, a voluptuous woman who loves food, to sympathize with them. Pffft!\n\nTheir sandwiches are huge and juicy. Pastrami? To die for! The hot dogs are immense and will fill you up. And the gyros are, surprisingly, amazing. They are loaded with onions, however, so make sure you have an altoid before going back to work. \n\nAlas, their fries are so-so and I have to dock them a star for this. \n\nBesides the insane hot dog statue, the walls are covered with images from Chicago. Da Bears! Da Cubs! I found the service to be very friendly - but they do get slammed at lunch time. However, if you plan ahead, you can call in your order and take it back to work with you."
0,I haven't got my food yet but all I can say is that in order from this place multiple times. One thing I am sure about is there delivery is supppppppppper slow. Like you will die if you order delivery from this place
1,"Great environment for a hang out, grab a few beers and wide selection of burgers. Workers are friendly and helpful."
0,The walls and the one dolalr bill thing is cool. but when i asked about it they said its a long story and walked away... WHAT? Also i checked in on yelp and got free fries... well was supposed to.. the cashier even marked it as used on my phone then we never got the fries. I order a chicken cheesesteak.. Literally chicken and cheese. Wow even being intoxicated it was bad. My brother also ordered a ROAST beef.. and they have gave him regular beef and cheese.. thats a hell of a difference. This place is literally to sober up at... not enjoy.
1,"This is a tiny place that is almost lost amidst the great selection of restaurants on Rue St. Denis, but it is a real find.\n\nThere's nothing special about the decor or the service, but the sushi is amazing.  If you want to try something new in sushi, come here.  Try the dragon eye roll or the geisha roll.  They use fruit and rice paper in some of their rolls and their seafood is very fresh.  Got a chance to speak with the owner and he clearly takes pride in what he produces in this humble place.\n\nOh, and bring a bottle of wine from the SAQ a block away.  He will bring you glasses and an ice bucket for free.\n\nGreat place for kids too because there is a great selection for them to try."
0,"I have no idea why everyone's so crazy about this place.  I was craving sushi and happened to spot the sign while driving down Bell so I dropped in for takeout.  Prices were average for sushi.  The restaurant looked nice, but while I stood in a corner waiting for my food, I noticed the area I was standing in had a very sticky floor.  Not very pleasant.\n\nI got a lunch special with chef's selection of nigiri and a spicy tuna roll.  I got home and opened the container to see my spicy tuna roll smothered with sauce.  I was kinda grossed out, but it turns out the sauce was necessary because the roll itself was the blandest I've ever hard.\n\nThe nigiri were also terribly bland.  It was a chore to eat them, which is really sad considering I love sushi.  One of the nigiri pieces had fish on it that tasted extremely earthy, like dirt.  Ugh!"
1,"I've gone to Las Vegas and stayed at this hotel twice. It's casino is beautiful, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the swimming pool is huge and amazing with a waterfall. Also, the erupting volcano is really neat. It's in a great location too."
1,The oxtail soup is what keeps us from coming back to this place everytime we visit las vegas.
0,"Maybe it's my fault for not doing my research before choosing a place to spend New Year's, but my experience last night has guaranteed that American Junkie will not get any more of my business. \n\nLike almost everyone else who showed up early, I assumed their flyer advertising free cover before 11 and a free champagne toast at midnight was legitimate. What I found instead, was that the management lied, (they even admitted it to our faces), and guys were now $20 to get in. (girls would be $10 after 10)\n\nHalf our group (mainly the girls) had already gone inside when we discovered that the guys we were with had to go hunt down ATMs, coming back to a line that was poorly-managed and about 2 hours long. \n\nAm I stupid for planning around a NYE flyer? Maybe. I'm new to Scottsdale and apparently not savvy enough to realize that some clubs in Old Town will just flat out lie to their patrons. They know they'll get hordes of rude douchebags knocking down their doors to come inside anyway. WHY?? Why was I even there and why did I give them my business? Never again.\n\nOh, and the inside was packed like sardines. They let in so many people that fights were breaking out left and right, getting a drink was hopeless, and bathroom lines were a half hour long. People were hopping the fence to get in, sick and tired of the line outside. But those in our party who had to wait so long to get in were disappointed anyway.\n\nWe stayed till midnight, thinking JUST MAYBE the bar would keep one promise they'd advertised all over their website, and pass out flutes of champagne. Nope.\n\nThis would have never happened in Downtown Phoenix. I know it's just a bar, but honestly people, we need to hold places accountable for deception. My friends and I planned a night out that got ruined... and half our party left, fed up with the situation.\n\nDon't go to American Junkie... it is just that, junk."
0,"Yuck!  the pizza we got was terrible. I read all these good reviews and was excited to try it.  The pizza was just gross, and tasted slightly undercooked.  I was super disappointed.   And to top it off, it wasn't cheap.  I would have been MUCH happier ordering Papa Johns for cheaper and better pizza.  \n\nAvoid this place."
0,"What in the hell were we thinking by going here?\n\nThis place would be at home on the street with Pink Cadillac, Manny's, etc. in Rocky Point. This bar was dirty, cheaply made, had sticky floors, and when I was there had nothing going for it other than a very friendly staff. The doorman made conversation with my girl and the waitresses made conversation with me. We both felt welcomed, but it was like being welcomed to the projects in Bronx, it was just super ghetto."
0,I know I'm in the minority here but I just didn't get it. The sushi was not bad but it was nothing to write home about. I didn't think the conveyer added anything to the experience. But I can see coming here if I worked nearby and had a sushi itch but not a lot of time for lunch.\n\nIf I could I'd go 2.5 stars but not quite a 3 for me. Not bad enough to say avoid at all costs. But just not somewhere I'd go back to except with friends if they wanted to go.
1,"This was an outstanding find in Madison!  Nice drinks, creative and delicious food and terrific service.  Points off for a fatty lamb dish, but the presentation and combinations would make me try it again.\n\nBest lobster bisque I've ever had!"
0,"i have stayed at mandalay bay, the venetian, caesars palace, ballys,  bellagio, even the rio! maybe even more vegas hotels but i have never had a hotel or motel experience that has been as off putting as this place.\n\nthe day before check in, i called to confirm our reservation of non smoking 2 queen bed and the reservation staff said that was correct and made no mention of no guarantees.  We checked in the next day  and got a king bed with a roll away.  \n\nThis is probably the most shocking part of this review.  I checked the sheets and found not only hair but stains that resembled bodily fluids and it wasn't just a stain- it was the real thing. the sheets had not even been changed but the bed just re-made.  I also found hair in the shower. Secondary to that the furniture was dusty and the carpet looked like it needed to be vacuumed.  i called house keeping and they came to change the sheets and were very apologetic and very nice.\n\ni called the front desk to let them know what was going on but no exageration ,was on hold for 15 minutes before an a front desk staff was available.  The front desk staff was told what had happened and she said that a queen room was now available if we wanted.  i told her i wasn't sure because the other guest in my room had already left for the evening and i didn't know if she wanted to pack her stuff up and move.  In response she said, your refusing a queen bed and thats what you wanted?  i asked to speak with management and they said they could not speak with me now but would call me back.  6 hours later still no call...\n\nAnyways, there's more but i hope  you're all getting the idea of what type of experience we had at the Aria.  I don't think i would ever stay at this hotel again unless they offered me something special to give it another chance and even then i'm a bit hesitant.  To be fair, some of the staff were very professional but some were just awful.  The pastries on the casino floor were really yummy especially the chocolate croissants.  They comped our room and gave us extra room service credit in the end because we practically forced them to address our problems but truly it wasn't enough to offset our yucky experience."
0,"Walked out ! Never in my life have I ever done that. The staff, especially the head maitre d' where extremely rude.  We brought a very nice bottle of wine with us and were informed we could not open it. Mind you we were seated with water poured. They did not allow it and no one did on the strip.......um we paid corkage the past three nights at high end places no problem. We had a show to go to and did not have enough time to take the bottle back to our hotel. The lack of costumer service and extreme arrogance for such a high respected place was astonishing. On the web site nothing was stated that you could not bring wine in. Went over to the Old Homestead Steakhouse and they were more than happy to open our wine, had the best prime rib there!\n\nWould have given 0 stars but program would not allow."
1,"When you are hungry at an airport - I find myself looking at the lines. Instead of going to the popular perhaps best place - I find myself going to the place with the shortest line and most of the time it isn't because they are the quickest servers.\n\nHowever, this place was actually different. It had a short line - it was quick on service and the food was exceptionally good for what it was. I wouldn't want to live off the food, but those fries - how do they do that - they were GREAT!\n\nThe value wasn't there though - and that's the problem with some of these food places at the airport. It isn't a 5 star restaurant, but they charge as if they were and that's a big turn off. However, if you are hungry and want something good and fast - check this place out for sure!"
1,"This is definitely a must-see when visiting Montreal. There's a five dollar entrance fee unless you're there to actually attend Mass, but it is worth it.\n\nFree 20-minute tours are held every 30 minutes in French and English, which are definitely worth staying for to get the history of not just the Basilica itself, but also how it ties into the history of the city of Montreal. One is also afforded the opportunity to gain perspective/meaning on the different features of the Basilica (the significance of the stained glass windows, the meaning of the bronze sculpture at the front of the chapel (which is behind the main church), the purpose of the single spiral staircase on the left side of the main church, what \""Notre-Dame\"" even means, etc etc etc...).\n\nIn three words: Just do it.\n\np.s. The Notre-Dame Basilica is a French parish, so for those non-Francophone Catholics that are visiting and considering attending Mass, be aware that all Masses are conducted in French."
0,"Grabbed a reservation early to eat before the Elton John show. While this was a great idea in theory, it still took 40 minutes to get our food and we ended up eating quickly and dashing out to make the show. It seems the food for other tables came out within 10 minutes of ordering before and after ours hit the table, so maybe ours got caught up in a rush...\n\nFood was average. Had the chicken salad sandwich and fries. There wasn't a lot of chicken salad and it was just okay. The fries were better. The other thing we got was the pub sliders and a side Caesar salad. Each of those were solid but not mind-blowing.\n\nService was friendly. Seems like it could be a cool place, but just didn't hit all the marks for me."
0,"The food was decent. The servers and waitstaff were very friendly to my service dog and I. Just as we were gathering to leave, our food and drinks in to to go containers, the manager plows around the counter: brusquely demanding, \""Is that a service dog?\""  \nI politely replied, \""yes.\""\nHe bellowed, \""Well, is it a he or she; it needs to be under the table.\""\nI responded, \""We're actually just leaving, she laid to the right of me out of the walkway.  She doesn't fit under table because of her size, and the rungs under the table.\""\nHe pointed, commanding: \""Next time, under the table.\""\nI apologized, \""I'm sorry, none of the servers asked us to move.\""\n\n\nA lady next to us said, \""Leave them alone, they're fine.\""\n\nDuring our meal, the waitstaff complimented my dog's courteous behavior and training."
1,"I used to eat at Mamma Mia's in Morristown, NJ and could not believe my ears when I heard they picked up and moved out here! I haven't had such a great calzone or slice of pizza in years! If you love pizza, you're gonna want to try this place."
1,"The food is reasonably priced and the atmosphere amazing. It felt like I was transported to another country. The host was very engaging and welcoming. The host announced a special performance for the guest by one of their dancers who danced within view of our table.\n\nThe food was tasty and affordable. The medium spice pad thai noodles was more like a mild to me. I could've went to a 5 or 6 in the 1-10 heat scale. Other than that, I really enjoyed and would come again."
0,"Pizza is ok, sauce is kinda bland,  but these wings are not good.  Wings have the taste of old or burnt oil"
1,"Lovely atmosphere, and creative dishes, located in the lobby of the Marriott. \n\nI was impressed by this restaurant, from the quiet setting with an uncrowded dining room to the casual friendliness of the waiters. And of course the beautiful and delicious food! The menu had a lot of options for a fancier place, and the dishes seemed to be quite unique - filet of elk, seafood, interesting complementing sauces and combinations. \n\nTwo types of complimentary cornbread (sweet and additionally peach & bourbon served with sweet kudzu butter) - yum! We started off with an appetizer, the ahi tuna with white chocolate foam and microgreens. it was very tasty, and was a decent sized portion for sure! I also enjoyed the warm lobster salad which was truly a piece of art to look at (a little awkward to eat) and very tasty - the flavors of everything blended well, I wish there were more greens though. For my entree I ordered a special - Yellow Fin Tuna with a grain of some sort and asparagus - I had it cooked medium, and it was great. There was just enough seasoning, but not too much to over power. The grains were mild and complimented the tuna. I would order it again. The people with me had the elk filet and were very pleased with their choice. \n\nOf course we had dessert. I opted for a dish with strawberries and kiwis with a marscapone ice cream. It was light, and maybe a little too sweet - but summery and fruity. The ice cream was great. The others ordered the crispy creme makers mark bread pudding and could not stop raving about it - so I would say go for it if that's your thing. \n\nOverall, I would go back. The bill was around 70 bucks a person, the service was great, and the food was very good.\n\nNote: their menu is out of date online"
0,"Rip off !!!! All I can say.  I went there on Tuesday morning 7/16/13 because I needed a tune-up for my car. Walked in and welcomed by a mechanic there. After he looked up my information in the system and said I need to change the valves cover gasket too because it's leaking. I asked for the total price of both tune up and change the gasket. He said the total would be around $700 something so I said I don't have enough money so I will come back the other day ( reason for saying that because I only needed the tune up now I need another gasket change and the price is too high!!!!) but he didn't let me walk out that easily and he asked me if I want to register for the card at their shop so I could pay with the car like a credit car that has $1200. I said ok and after 10 minus I got approve but I tried to walked out and he said you have $1200 in your card right now and 10% off why don't you just do it right now, do it when you can. I still tried to avoid it and said I'll come back and he raised his voice. At the point, I can't stay anymore and walked out. These people are trained to rip off people. So I searched on Yelp for another place and it showed that one place call \"" Busy Buggy \"" so I went there, got my car back at 1:30 for tuning up and valves cover gasket changes plus put on the rotor and brake pads which I had the parts and brought it there for them to installed it plus rotation. Surprisingly, $510 for everything and I got $25 off because now they are offering buy $50 for a deal of $75. Clean office and free sodas, cookies and ice cream for the hot days plus free ride home if you have to leave your car there."
0,Slow poor service.made us wait 20 mins for drinks. \nAnd wait for food was like 45 mins. \nStay away.
0,"I have been chef for 20 years and I only write reviews if a place is really good or really bad. This was both. Decor and waitstaff were good, but I can not get past the food poisoning we all got. It was the only meal we all shared upon arriving in Arizona on different flights, times, and airlines. We all had dinner together and the next day were were all extremely ill from top to bottom. Called the restaurant and was given the run around... as if I don't work in the industry and know how food poisoning occurs. We all had the same symptoms, sick at the same time, and were layed up for an entire day of my vacation. I would expect more from a four seasons...no compensation made and a memorable experience."
0,"Food was okay. Service, however, did not impress me. I stood waiting to order as several employees passed me by and didn't even make eye contact with me, as if they were pretending not to notice me. Like what the hell? Can't they even mutter a simple \""hello\""? Or \""someone will be with you shortly\""? Food wasn't too great, I won't be going back. I don't know why Chipotle has such good reviews, it's pretty mediocre.\n\nI'd rather go to Taco Bell."
0,"I've been to the Attic twice--the first time right before I moved to Vegas, and then again at their new location a couple days ago. All I can say is: Meh. I could be mistaken, but the old location seemed better--like they had a better selection of vintage at a better price. They seemed to have downsized at the new location, and only took the most expensive merchandise--I was hard-pressed to find any non-polyester dresses for under $100, and I noticed a few non-vintage pieces among the merchandise. If I wanted that, I would have gone to Buffalo Exchange. It's really not worth the trip, as far as I'm concerned, although if you're in the neighborhood it's worth a look. I'll save my money for the Midwest vintage shops, thank you."
0,"An update.  We went back to Blue Hound for dinner instead of just getting appetizers.  When we went it was in September (yes I'm behind in my reviews).  As I'm writing this review, I went to re-check the menu to remember the specific name of the dish I got, and the whole menu has changed.  So take that in mind, maybe the food will be better if you go now, vs. the menu selection we had in September. \n\nFrom what I remember, I was just generally unimpressed with what options we had to choose from and the food wasn't amazing.  That is why I decreased my rating.  The experience just made us cross this off the list of \""great places to eat\"" in phx.  I don't think we'll be doing a whole trip down here for the food.  \n\nI am curious to see if the new menu would be more promising though...."
1,Awesome people and yummy food. I always get the fish potato burrito! If I'm ever craving for Mexican food this is the place to come NO MATTER HOW FAR THE DRIVE! :]
0,"yuk! Find someplace else, the food and service here are punk, or thug just creepy.\n\nThe service staff are rude and condescending.  Maybe during the games this is a good place, I doubt it but any other time it's just a joke.\n\nI honestly thought the runner was goinging to knife us at one point.  \n\nCrowd of 20something punks.  \n\nDuring college playoff season, pro football ending weeks, college and pro basketball kicking up, and they have on baseball recruiting unbelievable. Asked our waitress and she informed me that usually they have on soccer at lunch.  \n\nWent to place some bets, no one to take them."
1,"Best bagel place I have ever been to.  I wish they had a cinnamon and sugar bagel.  But their hot bagels or croissants are delicious. Can't complain,  so fresh and great service. They'll need a bigger place eventually."
1,Best meal we've ever had. Got the jack Daniels ribs and the hibachi chicken skewers. Mark was our waiter and he was absolutely awesome. Would come back to this Fridays any day !
1,"I am ashamed I have lived here nearly 4 years and have just discovered this gem.  I read all the other reviews and HK Star really deserves to be a 4-5 star IMO.\n\nThe food is phenomenal.  I enjoyed going to KJ Kitchen and Joyful House but I will be coming here for now on.  We ordered at least 15 dishes for Chinese New Year.\n\nWe got most of the items listed in all these other reviews so I won't spout it off.  My suggestion is to bring a good orderer, someone who can order in cantonese/mandarin.   If you don't have any asian friends who can order, then PM me.    \n\nAnd I tend to say this in most of my Chinese restaruant reviews.... you can't rank Chinese restaurants on Service and Timeliness.  Asian restaurants get a pass, unfortunately.  Generally speaking, Asian people are rude.  \n\nGo walk in SF or NYC Chinatown and see how many people bump into you, cut you in line, spit on you, and deliver bad service.   Look we're kind of misunderstood.  Yah we're rude but alot of it has to do with culture, social upbringing, etc.   Just rank us for our food and nothing else"
0,"I used to like Anna's but the last time I went there, they did an absolutely awful job.  2 pair of yoga pants had one pant leg longer than the other and they shortened my sweat pants so short I donated them to Goodwill."
1,"in town for a conference and craving 'real food'/a substantial breakfast to start the day - breakfast club, walking distance to our hotel, completely delivered.  our server was super friendly, though we were sleepy and indecisive; she recommended the french toast side we ordered to be made ala bananas foster - YUM.  more like dessert but nothing wrong with dessert for breakfast...  otherwise we had fairly standard egg dishes but they were yummy, fresh, served quickly, and exactly what we needed.\n\nthe *only* complaint i have is wayfinding - perhaps, since they were setting up for an event downstairs, it was moved - but there were ZERO signs on ground level, and while we could smell bacon/coffee/breakfast, we had to lap the block a few times and only found it because we figured we may as well try the escalator...  a few signs would go far."
0,"Horrible customer service.  Seeing as how many of the floor employees are college-aged or somewhere thereabouts, their social skills are about as sharp as a high school student listening to an iPod at full volume while looking at the ground.  There are obviously employees who know all the right techno-jargon (I could hear them talking amongst each other), but not once did ANY employee offer to help me.  They all just seemed to be paired off in conversation with other floor workers without a care in the world, and far be it from me to interrupt them.  There was a general atmosphere of \""don't bother us, we can tell you're not a techie.\""   I was prepared to spend a fair amount of money on a new computer, and associated software, but due to the fact that they did nothing to help me, I took my business elsewhere.   Of course there are plenty of stores that have employees asking if you need help every two seconds, which can be annoying, but at least you feel valued as a potential customer.  At Best Buy Arrowhead, they can really take or leave you it seems.  I am a college kid myself, and I needed this equipment for school.  I was frankly angered by their obvious ignoring of myself and my brother. \n\nThe one redeeming thing:  although I was bothered, and subsequently left the store, the woman at the door said \""have a nice day.\""  At least one person gives a damn."
1,Incredible!  Very friendly service and wonderful food.  My husband and I tried the brown stew chicken and the oxtail.  Both excellent!  Prices were very inexpensive for the quality and quantity of food.  A must try!
0,Bad. Need to improve on customer satisfaction and hospitality . food and option are good but the other one makes me not go to same place again. But I still love the option what they have for lunch buffet.
1,"Lisa is a goddess among women. She really got to know me in order to find out the style that would work for me. She did not rush me whatsoever nor did she pressure me into buying the gown. \n\nShe even found a gown that was under my budget that was exactly what I was looking for. She let me sit down, take pictures, do whatever I wanted in the dresses to see if which was right for me. \n\nLater that day I went to two other salons and didn't receive even CLOSE to the service I received at Destiny's Bride, so I went back in the afternoon and ordered the dress."
1,"I went here recently with my mom for lunch. We had driven past it numerous times and finally bit the bullet and stopped. \n\nIt is a perfect spot for a downtown lunch. Cute, quaint, and quick service. Both my mother and I had the soup and 1/2 sandwich and while I wish there was more flavor in the soup, the sandwich was good and tasty. We topped off our lunch with a warm chocolate chip cookie- which was the highlight of my afternoon. If anything I will need to go back for a cookie, or two."
0,"They have the fitbit aria scale here!   So it's $129.99.  The fitbit flex in slate or violet is $99.99.  Yeesh!\nI don't shop here routinely but this is one of the stores I come to purchase cd's when they're on sale.  For whatever reason they have a much better selection than Mall Wart and they usually have a new release, that I might like, at a low price every couple of months.\nWhat I don't like about Target is their cheezy baskets of seasonal items on display near the entrance.  Lots of poor quality, Made in China items, sold for next to nothing.  I see most of this stuff as waste that frequently winds up at Goodwill and/or landfills.\nThe store is generally clean and shelves stocked.  The staff is pleasant enough.\nNot sure how much profit they've generated now that all employees walk around attached to walkie talkies (you remember those right?  I mean you're old enough to remember those, right?), but wish they could turn the volume down on the things and possibly refrain from following me while talking on them.  I always turn around to see if they're talking to me because like I said, I don't shop here regularly."
1,"Eat. Here.  There is a vast menu, food is reasonably priced. The food is well prepared.  I can keep going on  and on, but I am making myself hungry thinking about this place.  Yummo!"
0,"They're ok. The steak isn't tender so that means it's not my first nor second choice. But I do stop in when I specifically just want chicken tamales, rice and beans. Not as attentive sometimes, I have to ask for every detail and one time the waiter got frustrated. I may not know everything they have, excuse me. Maybe he didn't understand me. I wanted mole sauce for my tamale."
1,Food was excellent and fast lots of great choices Service was very friendly and on top of things
1,"Food was amazing. The concierge at the Four Seasons recommended it to us, and we are happy he did. To start The doughnut muffins were scrumptious! The Spanish omelette was light, creamy and melted in your mouth good. Service was friendly and knowledgeable. We look forward to\nComing back soon! The steak was well made and the burrata was very good. The homemade potato chips and dipping sauces went very well together and tasted very good."
0,"WARNING:  Don't order the veal.\n\nMy brother heard about Gilbert Pizza from a co-worker, who happens to live in the area.  The guy gave it high praises and said it was the best Italian food he has eaten in Arizona, so we decided to check it out.  There were three of us, my brother, his wife, and myself, and we all had different entrees.  The chicken Marsala, chicken Parmigiana, and the veal Parmigiana   I thought it was nice that they bring a dish of garlic knots to the table to start you off.  My brother and his wife were happy with the chicken dishes.  They thought the sauce was decent, the sides of pasta was done well, and the portions of chicken was ample.\n\nI figured I would try the veal since most Italian places don't offer it and I haven't had any veal in years.  I did ask the waitress before ordering if it was real veal and not a veal patty.  She said it wasn't a patty, which it wasn't.  What she failed to say was that it was a sheet of paper.  If it was any thinner,  it would've been invisible.  For $16.99, I got mostly breading and cheese.  I'll stick to my favorite Arizona Italian restaurant for an authentic Italian dinner, Va Bene's.   As for Gilbert Pizza, it's not so va bene."
0,this place is a dump.  half the menu from the website is not actually being served anymore and they are NEVER OPEN during business hours.  having a restaurant is a business not a hobby.  if you're going to sell food then be consistently open otherwise nobody is going to waste their time driving over to be greeted by a locked door and inaccurate hours of operation posted outside.  buncha amateurs running this place into the ground.
1,"Excellent 60 minutes of laughter.  He spent a good 20 minutes on me alone.  It's good clean dirty humor.   Of your sensitive stay away.  You have to be able to laugh at yourself   6th time seeing it, laughter heals all and this is good clean fun.  It's a must see"
0,"I would not rent from Dollar again.  We were quoted a price of $870 which included taxes and fees, but were charged $1200.  We waived add'l coverage, but clerk added it anyway and tacked on other fees."
0,"I was really excited to try this place but left with a bad taste in my mouth. Hubby and I ordered the Di Fara Special and small thin crust NY Big Apple Pizza. Both came out burned,  we are talking black pepperoni and crust on the Di Fara and even the thin crust had black spots on the edges.  The waiter was very friendly and knowledgable, but I was puzzled when I asked him if this is how they normally serve their pizza, burned to a crisp. He laughed and said no, then said he would have them remake us a new one \""lightly cooked\"".  The 2 nd attempt was much better but I would not go back again to eat there."
0,"We decided to give Snooze a try this past Saturday.  I went prepared for an hour plus wait and was pleasantly surprised to find out the wait was only 15 to 20 minutes. We put our name in and they texted us about 15 minutes later.  On time...great!  We immediately go to the hostess stand and were told our table was being bused and to wait off to the side.  Um...ok...  Ten more minutes go by so I went back up to the hostess stand to see what was going on.  She said that I was going to be seated any minute.  I look at my phone and they had texted me again despite me standing in the exact same place the entire time.  Weird.  Anyway, we are finally seated.  \n\nI order a diet coke and the waitress brings me a coke.  No big deal.  I tell her and she brings me a new drink and takes our order.  In the meantime, apparently Snooze VIPs are seated next to us as the manager spent several minutes talking to them and they were even given a free pancake.  Nice.  Good for them.  Not so nice is when they get their food before us even though we were seated ten minutes earlier.  A half hour goes by....still no food. Our waitress says it will be out \""any minute\"".  More people that were seated after us are getting food and some of them are even done eating by the time ours finally comes out.  I ordered the French toast, which was good but not great.  It was two slices of wonder bread with a strawberry or two on top.  My fianc\u00e9 got a bowl of hash browns with some cheese on top.  I can't remember what they called it on the menu.  I guess the food was good enough that I would go back if the experience was better.  At this point it's not worth it for me.  We live less than a mile from Snooze and love to go out to breakfast.  Despite the convenient location, I don't think we will be back."
1,"I hired Wave to clean up a rental house, 3 beds, 2 baths, not a huge place. Initially I was a little unsatisfied, but I had left the cleaner unattended and couldn't review the work immediately. But I called them the next day and expressed my dissatisfaction, and they sent a second cleaner to redo the job at no charge. The final result was good! Wish I hadn't had to go through it twice but they made it right."
0,I am not a big fan of sushi. There food is okay here I will only go if my friends are going but the service is so so bad. If it weren't for my friends I would never go there again.
0,"Hello, Pendelton. Remember me? I'm the one that you were indifferent to today, Christmas Eve, when I was shopping for a blanket for my husband. Yes, I'm not a blue-haired, blazer sporting, pearl-wearing WASP.  Yes, I walked into your store wearing black lace cuffs, with a glittery purple moon on the cleavage poking out of my heavy metal-esque shirt and my silver pentacle shining in the bright lights of your store. No, I may not have been your typical customer, but I had money to spend, and I wanted to do it in your store on one of your high-end blankets. You know, the ones over $200.  Well, guess what. The indifferent treatment that bordered on rude made me realize that I wasn't appreciated by you. When I asked your clerk to help me find a blanket in the size I needed he pointed me in a direction and flitted away like I was going to eat him, even though I put on my friendliest, most gentile persona and thanked him sincerely for what little assistance he offered.  And, I was the ONLY one in the store during the whole episode.  You can be sure that I will get my blanket for my husband, but it will not be in your store."
0,"Okay Resturant, everything was marginal, chicken was dry, what they stand for is great but if you want good food this is not the place."
1,"This place was a really good surprise, the Clam chowder was delicious, the staff attentive and the ambient is beautiful.  A good place  if you like sea food. If you are at Courtyard Downtown Montreal do not think twice, it is above the entrance of the parking."
1,"The classic \""sticks in your gut\"", \""makes you want to take an afternoon nap\"", guilt inducing pizza that everyone should indulge in every now and again.  \n\nAlso, great value."
0,"It takes a lot to seriously make me hate any dining experience. This place did just about everything it could think of to make me wish I never used an iphone app to find it. \n\nI went to Vegas this weekend to enjoy UFC 106 with some close friends. After Forrest Griffin made me happy I decided to top off the evening with something like The boiling Crab or the Crab hut. I used my friend's iPhone to find the nearest spot for us to indulge in some Cajun goodness. We got in a cab and hurried over to Cajun Crawfish. We arrived to find the place almost empty. We were sat and the waiter returned with our drinks. We ordered our usual and waited for about 15 minutes only to have the waiter return to our table to tell us they were out of corn on the cob....whaaaat?? ok ok ok...I can deal with that. But then we waited about another 30 minutes only to be confronted with the most flavorless crawfish and shrimp I have ever tasted in my life! Our potatoes come and they have no seasoning anywhere and are waaay undercooked. We sent the potatoes back to be cooked longer and they were still under cooked when the waiter brought them back. We ordered some steamed white rice and even that was horrible....how do you screw up rice? The sausage was undercooked, the crawfish was over cooked and lacked any flavor except spice. the shrimp was ok at best...a tad over cooked but still...ok. We tried to tell the female waitress about the potatoes and the rice only to find she doesn't speak English, so we were then stuck playing charades with the girl. After we were finished with our disaster of a dinner...we asked for wet naps. The lemon scented ones tend to cut the fishy smell out of your hands. Guess what?? No wet naps. \n\nWe agreed to call it quits for the evening and head back to the hotel. We asked the waiter to call a cab.....after asking every employee in the joint \""Do we have cab number?\"" we decided to make use of the iphone once again and called our own cab. \n\nWe waited outside for our cab and noticed the sign for Cajun Crawfish stated \""Grand Opening\"". Well, I don't know about \""grand\"" but I guess the place is new. So here is my advice to the owners....shut down for a week and visit The Boiling Crab in LA area. Notice the flavor, the decor, the hospitable service, the flavor and the flavor or their food. Then come back to Vegas and regroup. There is no point in owning a below average establishment like this. When you have visitors that know what their food is supposed to taste like and visit your restaurant with certain expectations....they are just going to leave seriously unhappy and are going to tell all their friends about their piss poor experience. Not trying to be mean...but Cajun Crawfish is way under par. \n\nCajun Crawfish failed to deliver...in EVERY way possible. I will not go back and I will make sure that no one I care about makes the same mistake I did by going here. Waste of time, waste of money and there was a risk of food poisoning with the whole undercooked sausage thing. It's clear this place doesn't care about the quality of their food....looks like they are just happy enough to be open and have anyone walk through their doors. \n\n2 lb shrimp (1 mild and 1 medium) FAIL \n2 lb Crawfish (medium) FAIL \n12 practically raw potatoes FAIL \nno corn on the cob MAJOR FAIL \n24 undercooked sausage FAIL \n3 orders of slice bread GOOD \n2 order rice FAIL \n\nI would have been happier with Popeye's Chicken and Biscuits"
0,"I was very hungry during my lunch break and this was nearby so I wondered inside.\nI found myself ordering the a chicken sandwich. I asked the young lady how was chicken on the sandwich cut, she explained that it was chopped. When I was given my sandwich chopped was not the word. The chicken breast was chopped into big huge pieces which kept falling out of the sandwich. I believe it would have tasted better if they would chopped the mean up into bite size pieces if not shredded or a maybe even a chicken breast patty would have been better option. The sandwich ended up satisfying me for lunch. I would like to go back and try other menu items."
1,"Shhh, its a speakeasy lounge so whisper and remember the entrance is at the rear of the building!\n\nNot a huge selection of wine for a wine bar, but by all means very adequate.  You can get wine by glass, bottle, or flight.  Glass prices are $9+ and flights start at $15.  \n\nThis place also offers a variety of small plates and unique cheeses, as well as, a good selection of vodka, tequila, and after dinner liqueurs.\n\nThe service definitely left more to be desired so don't expect much in this area.\n\nIn terms of the comfort, the place is a decent size (much bigger than speakeasy places you'll find in NYC) and has several couches and small tables.\n\nOverall, great place for a date or to chill out with friends, as long as you are patient.\n\nCheck it out!"
0,"I hadn't been to Manuel's in years and remembered it as being decent.  I went recently and the service was poor, the food was cold and bland.  I will not go back."
0,"My family arrived to celebrate my moms birthday! The hosting staff did a great job of seating us in a minimal amount of time. We had an emergency change in plans and they accommodated us quickly. They also accommodated the temperature of the room for our easily cooled friends. Everyone enjoyed their food. And the server was great UNTIL......two spiders crawled up onto our table right between me and my son. When I complained, I got some half assed excuse that they had just sprayed the night before from the manager. My husband, not wanting to look douchey and not like we were just trying to get a free meal, told them not to worry about it. But personally, I think they still should have done something about it. When you pay for a $500 meal, you don't want to deal with bugs. I was in the service industry for nearly 10 years, I understand the prejudice that goes on behind closed doors. I understand that they probably thought I was lying, but frankly, I couldn't care less. That's gross. I don't want to pay for a meal with bugs."
1,Just moved from Indiana and wanted to find out what all this hub-ub was about with this burger joint called in-n-out. DIDN'T know what I was missing. Best burger that wasn't $30 that I have ever had!

0,This is NOT the best brunch in Charlotte. It's a small chain located in a shopping plaza full of families with their 2 strollers and screaming children. The food was decent but I'm sad I made a drive this way for brunch.
1,"I visited Veneto Trattoria for the first time at lunch today.  What a pleasant surprise!  I love the cozy atmosphere of this quaint restaurant and the attentiveness of the wait staff.  Of course, the food was divine!  I highly recommend the salmon salad, if you're looking for lighter fare.  It was delicious - flavorful, moist and sized just right.  My co-worker was also impressed with his pasta dish.  I will definitely keep Veneto Trattoria in my Scottsdale rotation!"
0,Kind of a hassle. Stayed here for my buddy's bachelor party and when we checked in we got a single king bed instead of a double bed room which is what we really wanted. \n\nIt's a beautiful place to look at and the tech in the room is cool.
0,"My husband and I recently moved to the Valley and were super excited when we passed by Dickey's. We lived in TX for many years and visited various locations where we always has good service and good food.  The girl who served us was warm & friendly. Once we received our good, the experience went downhill quickly. I had chopped brisket and only ate two bites because it was insanely greasy. My husband had pulled pork, sausage and jalape\u00f1o beans. All of the food was room temp and simply gross. What a disappointment. We won't be back."
0,"My group went to Nobhill Tavern for the late night happy hour, expecting to have one of the best meals of our Vegas trip.  We were nothing but disappointed. \n\nService:  We had one of those servers who think nothing is more impressive than not writing down our orders.  I told him three times I wanted the little wedge salad with NO BACON.  When the salad came, it had bacon.  Of course.  Everything else we ordered arrived, and he came to check on us after we had finished.  We told him we never got our flatbread.  Obviously, he forgot to put it in, but instead of fessing up he told us it takes a long time because they make each one fresh.  So...does that mean everything else we got was just sitting around?  When the flatbread came a few minutes later, it wasn't even warm.  There was nothing about it that would have taken any longer than the rest of our order.\n\nFood:  We ordered the beer battered shrimp, two lobster rolls, the little gem wedge salad, flatbread, and house made chips and dip.  The chips and dip came first, and were the best I've ever had - ah, we had such high hopes for Nobhill!  However, the shrimp were nothing special, and $8 for four pieces of shrimp is nuts if there is nothing special about them.  The lobster rolls had a weird fake-lemon taste, in a bad way.  The wedge salad came with four halves of grape tomatoes (so only two tomatoes total), three small pieces of bacon (that I didn't want), and three chunks of iceberg lettuce with a flavorless blue cheese dressing.  The flatbread was basically a cracker with a spinach/tomato topping.  It was all mediocre, the lobster rolls were actually on the bad side.  Everything was $8 for the late night menu, but the chips and dip were $5.\n\nOverall, my expectations were not met, and I will not be back."
0,"Oh you gotta be fucking kidding me.  \n\nIf you live in a dorm, topper's is like your idea of heaven.  There's something about being that age that makes you want to order cheese covered bread that's so greasy that it soaks through the box and then dip it in ranch dressing.  \n\nYou know what that something is called?\n\nIt's called weed."
0,"My experience likely would have been different if it wasn't for the server. Nothing is worse than someone making you feel stupid for asking a question.\n\nAs an example, my girlfriend asked for a better knife to cut into her chicken (she only had a butter knife). Our server gave us a look that made us feel dumb for asking and he answered back something along the lines of, \""That knife should work fine.\"" He eventually did get a better knife for her, but that isn't really something he should be arguing. Get a better knife - it's a simple request. \n\nHe was also rude when she asked a simple question about having gluten free bread. It wasn't a judgement, just a question. We weren't expecting them to have gluten free buns or bread, but making us feel dumb for asking isn't what we're looking for. \n\nThe food was spot-on, can't deny that. The rest of the staff seemed quite nice, too. First impressions go a long way, and our server simply didn't do his job. \n\nBeyond that, it's a bit small but those are the only negatives. Not the best barbecue I've ever had, but certainly top 5. \n\nI hope you have a better server if you try this place."
0,"So I hate to write a bad review but I'm all for giving any place a review if it was anything below or above average. Honestly, this was way below average. The pizza was literally the worst pizza I have ever had, ever.. it seemed as if it was left out all day, it was hard and very dry & they forgot my ranch :( the only reason I gave two stars was because my cheesecake was really good & the delivery guy was bad ass, I liked his attitude & just all around good vibes. The guy on the phone whom I ordered from was also very polite and nice. Just really bad pizza. If you guys can fix that, then you would be grade A."
0,"My daughter got a good haircut but the staff wasn't very friendly. We walked into an empty store and stood there for almost a minute before the two girls behind the counter would even acknowledge our presence while they chatted away. Then the first words out of their mouth were \""can I get a phone number?\"" Not very inviting for a place who's marketing message is fun and cool."
1,"I just love Reynas!  Their tortillas are so amazing. Margaritas: to die for!  We had shrimp enchiladas, fish tacos and chile rellenos.   All great!  My only diss was that I was to wussy for their chipotle salsa, and that's on me, not them. I'll adjust my palate to live up to it. They give the consumer a choice of 6 different salsas. (We sampled the tomatillo and the aforementioned chipotle. ). Love the Reynas!"

1,"So happy to have found this restaurant, it was the complete package for night out. \n\nFirst, the decor welcomes you in and sets the mood... \nBeautiful lighting, check\nMiro artwork, check\nBeautiful bar area and classy place settings, checkity check.\n\nNext up, the food and drink. I ordered the Paella de Pollo and a number of Tapas. Everything was delicious and came out hot and fresh from kitchen. No overwhelming spices and heat in these dishes--the flavors are more subtle and carefully prepared. Pre-dinner rolls were not the best, but I did not want to fill up on that anyway.  There was a decent wine selection and full bar for drinks.  Drinks have nice flavor but are not made strong, so if you are a booze hound, you've been warned.  The prices are medium-high, not outrageous for a restaurant in this area.\n\nFinally the entertainment. This is just an added bonus that takes the restaurant to the next level.  You can enjoy Spanish guitar and Flamenco while dining? Yes. And it is fantastic.  Be aware, some people come just to enjoy the music, so there will be people hovering about the tables during the performance. It can get a bit crowded near stage (bordering on claustrophobic).  And while I enjoyed the atmosphere-some people might not. But if you love live music and the energy that comes with it, you wont be disappointed.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit or three. Muy bien!!"
0,"I really like the ambiance here for breakfast but the service is TERRIBLE and they are always out of staple items, like English Breakfast tea. \n\nI had a morning business meeting breakfast here, paid the bill and tipped 20%. I asked for more tea and got charged again, okay, fair enough. I paid the additional bill but did not tip again on the $2.50, the waiter followed me outside and confronted me about why I didn't tip again on the second bill as I was standing with my client. Tacky.  Also, they need to step up the menu.  The menu is limited and not prepared very well, which is a shame, because it has a great Euro Cafe type of environment."
0,"Not the best first experience. I was excited about the menu but disappointed with the execution. I ordered a steak salad and a juice. The salad was a handful of greens and four small chunks of beef that was nearly impossible to chew or cut (with the butter knife provied) also asked for olive oil instead of balsamic and i got an oil but not olive,  the antiox juice was heavy beet greens flavor and one quarter foam...all for $20+ . Not great food...not great service."
0,"After reading all the good reviews of the other Mesa Crackers and Co, I went to this one because it's closer to my house. \n\nI don't know what all the hype is about. I found it to be just about the blandest, most boring, overpriced breakfast I've had in a long time. I got the Vatican which is a skillet with eggs cooked to order, hash browns, red and green bell pepper, onion, mushrooms, and bits of bacon along with sausage and cheese all mixed together. I got the cheese on the side and ended up not putting much on. It was about $8.50.\n\nFirst, the sausage wasn't breakfast sausage, or perhaps it's like no breakfast sausage I've seen. It appeared to be Italian sausage or some rendition. The pieces were big and not my cup of tea at all. I'd have much rather had traditional breakfast sausage. It's clearly the standard, why mess with it? Maybe becuase it's called \""The Vatican\"" but still, I wished it was marked on the menu that the sausage was different. I pulled all of them off my plate, I disliked them so much. \n\nThe skillet had no seasoning whatsoever. I'm not a big fan of salt but it tasted like they didn't put any salt on anything, or any seasoning for that matter. I had to salt my food which I never do. Usually I think things are too salty eating out. \n\nThe hashbrowns were pretty good but it's hard to mess that up. Nothing else was tasty. I ended up dumping Cholula over the whole thing which made it more edible. It was relatively greasy for how unflavorful it was. Even the english muffin that came on the side was flat and not very doughy. Most of the wait staff seemed pretty nice but our waitress wasn't all that great and only checked on us once even though she passed every 2 minutes to get to other tables. \n\nI would not try this place again. Their desserts did look good if you're into that thing."
0,"Other reviewers have mentioned the sub-par seats. I concur. Serviceable at best, but not going out of their way to make me comfortable much less enhance my experience.\n\nWhat really makes this place the target of my ire is the so-called \""IMAX Experience\"" theater. I drove a long long way and paid through the nose to see Star Trek. Turns out I would've gotten a comparable experience for less money and without the drive had I been warned that this is NOT an IMAX theater.\n\nDon't tell me the sound is better or the film is better. I'm not having it. The differences are marginal and not worth the extra expense. I wanted big, soaring, engrossing, enveloping. What I got was ripped off.\n\nI realize that much of the blame here goes to IMAX themselves who have decided to market this \""product\"" in an effort to capitalize on their brand identity, but the theater is still the purveyor and is responsible for seeing to my satisfaction."
1,"Without a doubt, one of the best in Vegas! We had the Filet with Merlot Butter, Scallops, Trout Almondine, awesome, awesome, awesome! You really can't beat the view (patio view of the Bellagio fountains), food, price for the quality of food on the strip, and romantic to boot!"
0,"\""MY God, what have I done to deserve this\"", were the words I spoke when eating here. Being in Las Vegas, Nevada, a.k.a. Sin City, I knew that I had to atone for my sins, but I do not know what sin I could have committed to deserve this place! I can not tell you how many times I've been disappointed by restaurants that tout their great service and even better food, then come away feeling despondent.\n\nHowever, this restaurant takes the proverbial cake, and a crap one at that!\n\nWhere to begin? After having been sitting at a table with my guest for 15 minutes, the waitress finally decided it was time to work. Realizing that she was indifferent, my guest and I ordered some red wine to numb the pain we knew lay ahead. When the wine came, it was as warm as the desert outside the hotel. Enduring this bit of pain, we decided to press our luck further.\n\nI ordered the Kobe steak which after about 40 minutes of wondering when my food would show up, came most disappointingly. Kobe beef, the most rarified and king of all steaks, prepared properly medium rare, came out well done. Well done! I was horrified to see such splendor squandered. I decided to take a bite and tasted charcoal. I was livid. I found my nonexistent, indifferent waitress and demanded to see the manager.\n\nA manager came round and apologized and brought me another Kobe steak, this time thankfully, faster than the last. When it finally arrived, it too suffered a cruel fate reserved only for witches in Salem. I spoke with the manager who brought out his manager. This new bloke apologized some more and took my meal off my bill. My bill? Yes, it seems I still had to pay for my guest whose food was only average. I feel that if one person's meal is ruined, everyone's is. Therefore everything should be taken care of. Sadly, Strip Steak doesn't think this way. Strip Steak simply doesn't think or cook for that matter. They can apologize well though."
0,"This afternoon, I begged my husband to get me out of Scottsdale.  I, based on there website, checked out The Clarendon Hotel in D-Town - It was so horrible - that is all I will say.  I felt like I was in a bad John Waters flick - if Sid and Nancy were alive (and traveling) here is the place they would be!  Yikes!  I will say that the front desk guy was very nice and the decor was cool (although they need to repair whatever is going on with there front entrance).  Perhaps, I am just too mainstream.  Sorry Clarendon."
1,"This 2 story restaurant was pretty busy for a Monday evening, but we were quickly seated. The menu is very diverse and includes many funky dishes, but we went conservative by ordering Szechuan eggplant hot pot that came out sizzling and a lamb stir fry with green onions. Both dishes were executed to perfection and delicious.\nAdding to our pleasure, we found the wait staff to be very hospitable and professional so this restaurant will remain on my To Do list."
0,"Located in the MGM Grand outside by the pool, we figured we'd eat this before going into the pool.  I know you're not supposed to go into the pool right after you eat, but hey, it's Vegas.\n\nI had the chicken strips which came with 4 big pieces of chicken and a bucket of seasoned crisscut fries.  Tasted good and there was a lot of it.\n\nThe grilled cheese sandwiches were a different story.  Two sandwiches came out with the cheese barely melted.  Thats not grilled cheese in my book.   Also one sandwich was missing the fries it was supposed to come with.  So it took a while to get that straightened out.\n\nThe frozen drinks were not that great either and kind of expensive, $20 dollars each. Considering that the service wasn't very good, it was annoying that the bill had already added in the tip for a group of 4 people."
0,"We used to regularly go to Kennedy's, mostly to see a couple of nice bartenders before heading to Jack's. These two, Justin and the bubbly one with curly brown hair (sorry, I cannot remember her name), are very nice, thorough, and always remember our names/drinks. However, god forbid that you ever have a server other than these two at Kennedy's. \n\nThere's been at least four different occasions where I or my friends have been given the wrong check, corrected the check, and then charged for the first check with an entirely different order. The waitresses can't seem to get it together there."
0,"Worst flight ever. Booked a flight for $300 from Las Vegas to Chicago, when I went online to check in, I was confused by having to pay for my seat? What the? So I picked the cheapest $10, when I arrived at the airport I then learned that it was $40 to check my bag, I questioned the agent and she told me that it is cheaper to check the bag online, why didn't they say this on the website? So now I'm infuriated. I get on the plane and notice how dirty the headrests on the seats were, they were black. Then one of the stewardess' came over the speaker and announced \""if you have a device that has an on/off button, it needs to be turned off, it's not that hard people\"" I'm sorry, what? Is that how you speak to the customers? The seats were so uncomfortable and then we took off and there was a loud unsettling noise I thought the wings were going to fall off. Needless to say, between the poor customer service, uncomfortable ride, and the extra $100 I had to pay in extra fees, there is no way I will fly this airline again."
0,"Okay I'm definitely not a fan and would not go out of my way to eat here. \nI had this place bookmarked for my Christmas trip and was initially excited to go. \nTurns out the only thing enjoyable was the snow crab legs which were actually sweet ( as compared to one's at the Caesar's buffet from the previous day, but at least the food at Caesar's was actually decent).\nThe clams and the mussels in the cute little buckets were dried out from sitting out and full of sand. The chorizo ( at least i think it was chorizo) tastes like what armpits smells like, hence \""armpit clams\"". The layout was rather strange since all the seafood were next to each other in one section so the line for that was long and insane ( plus you have the crazy asian ladies jumping in and out because they think they are special and for them to have to stand in line like the rest of us is absurd- i want to trip them).\nThe prime rib was overcooked, even when i asked for the rarest piece. \nOysters were pretty decent although it had quite a bit of shell fragments, but i know these gluttonous folks had those shuckers madly working away.\nThe shrimp cocktail were huge but don't let that fool you. They were tasteless.\nOh yeah, not macarons. What the heck. Had they had that I would have upped my review to three stars.\n\nthe good:\nlines to get in where long and confusing and at first we didn't realize it was only a line leading towards the kiosk. so you use the kiosk to put down your reservation and it'll print out what time you should return to check in. that way you are free to do anything else rather than stand in line for 3 hours.I\""m not sure if they only have that when it's a holiday and crazy crowded because from what i heard they didn't do it via that system before."
1,"We stopped in on a whim and we were glad we did. This is no ordinary taco shop! We ordered two smashed jack potato/marinated spinach & mushroom enchiladas, covered in spicy green sauce with just a touch of homemade guacamole and two orders of tortilla soup. I went with the corn tortillas, which are thick and did not get soggy and disintegrate as soon as the sauce touched them. The flavor of everything was outstanding and the portions were just right. I have no need for a burrito that weighs as much as a bowling ball although I realize that for some people, more food = more value. I will take more flavor anytime. For the meat eaters, I noticed that they have short rib, bison, chicken, and I am sure some type of beef but I wasn't pay that close of attention to that. The menu is simple but there is a wide variety of toppings and fillings to customize your order. The prices are reasonable, too. The enchiladas, soups, and three drinks came to a grand total of $20.13 and we were more than satisfied. We will be back!"
1,"Do you love pizza? Well if you do,then LGO is the perfect place to go. LGO has many toppings and flavors. Such as margarita, Mother earth (veggie) and spicy sausage. Really excellent. The pizzeria has fast service. It also serves homemade gelato. LGO is the perfect place to go to dinner and be with friends."
1,Love this place! It is one of the few restaurants opened 24/7 so whenever you are ready to eat this is the place to go! The desserts are great and so is the food. They recently re-did their menu from when they first opened it and its still great. The one thing that I miss is the ability to order breakfast 24/7. What is awesome about this restaurant are the variety of drinks you can order. My favorite is the jolly rancher martini. It tastes exactly like a cherry jolly rancher! The only downside to the drinks are the prices. The large goblet drinks are $36 and most of their martinis are $16. Since this is Vegas the prices are what you would think but it would be nice if it was a little cheaper. As far as food goes their burgers are great! Their pasta bolognese is also very good as well. If you are in the mood for desserts I would recommend their fondue. They have a variety of things to dip in their different chocolates. My favorite is dipping strawberries into milk chocolate! If you are a tourist I would say you should go here. If not for dinner at least for a drink or two. Try to sit outside because you have a great view of the Belliago fountains!
0,"Slow slow slow slow slow. Found this place looking for a dannys car wash, for an oil change.  Oils been done cars been washed, can't even pay, it's been over half hour wtf is happening 0.0 come on ppl. Not coming back. Plus this place is more expensive ..."
0,"Worst place ever... Customer service it's sucks... I bought 2 coffees, they were cold... I ask IMARI to make fresh coffee... She ask me to heat them up on the microwave... I said no... I want fresh one... She said that's the only one they got... She did not said sorry or nothing... I trash the coffee... She didn't ask me to if I want my money back or nothing... On my way out she was laughing very hard that mad me very mad...  She was lazy to make new coffee... I will call her  supervisor... And I will not go ever back their...."
1,"Great food, really good prices! Cream cheese potato soup yes yes!!!!!\n\nI like this location because it has a ton of seating. Usually at other locations it is nearly impossible to find a table, at this location I always find one.\n\nMy only complaint is that every time I have come here they only have one cashier working, and usually the line is super long to order."
1,"The brunch was divine: mouth-watering pork, fried sweet potatoes, and bread that could have been manna sent from Heaven. If I could, I'd be here every weekend. The waiter who was from Peru told my fianc\u00e9 and me all sorts of stories about his homeland, its traditions and its food. Definitely one of the best brunch experiences I've had in Phoenix!"
0,Worst service I have ever encountered.. After an hour of sitting at the table with my main entree still in the kitchen somewhere .. I got up and left.. The manager decided to give me the meal for free.. In which I drive home and went to bed... Ruined my evening plans.. Missed my movie I was planning on seeing with my girlfriend... NEVER will I go here again!!!
0,"My husband and I, along with another couple, visited the Golden Phoenix a few weeks ago; we shared the Mandarin Dinner.  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere was awesome.  Food - not so good.  One thing we noticed - just about every item of food was fried!  Certain items are expected to be fried, such as the chicken wings & the egg rolls on the Pu Pu platter (btw - very bland!).  But the Beef on skewers?  Fried to the point of toughness that I couldn't even chew it.  Worst of all, they do not put knives out as part of the place setting, so you cannot even cut the tough meat they expect you to eat.  The one saving grace to the entire meal was the Mu Shu Pork, which was very tasty with the condiment of dark, rich plum sauce.  The entire dinner was quite plentiful, and we had a lot of food left over, but no one wanted to take it home.  Sad, as this restaurant has been around for 35 years; we probably will not be back.  Two stars for the great atmosphere & service."
0,"Not impressed.  It seemed mainly like a corridor of bars and restaurants for 20 somethings to hang out and get toasty. \n\nI thought with all the hype it would be something new, fun and exciting, but I think I'll avoid it at all costs.  It just isn't worth the hassle of dealing with the craziness on the Strip.  \n\nThe Visitors to Vegas can have The Linq, but as a local, I'm going to stick with The District, Town Square and Tivoli Village, all of which I much prefer."
1,"LOVE BEACH HUT!!!!! The Santa Cruz and the Malibu are my favorites, both great pastrami sandwiches. They've got great microbrews on tap for really cheap ($7 for a liter of microbrew is a steal!!!). Great friendly, laid back atmosphere. Steven and Courtney are great hosts."
1,"My family loves this place, Expect it to me crowded though and the service isn't always super but the food is good and the salsa is nice and spicy. We love eating here, they are not open on Sundays though!"
0,Two words. Smoke everywhere. . The rooms smell like smoke. They leave ash trays everywhere for anyone to smoke.  Everyone smokes outside their rooms. My son who has asthma could hardly play in the pool because everyone smoked right in the pool. . It was  disgusting!
1,"It's a decent Target. The people were friendly and the layout was commonsensical. No wine for sale in Nevada though, really? Ugh. I miss California."
0,"Overrated.  I don't recommend this buffet.  We went for Thursday dinner, which costs around $40/ person.  I was excited because I've heard so many good things about it.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  Variety was limited.  Street taco station was not done setting up.  Pasta was bland, bread was not fresh, ahi poke only had like 2 pieces on a plate. I would look crazy holding 5 small plates just to get a serving of ahi poke.  \n\nThe best thing I ate was the cookie in a dish and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nMirage buffet is so much better."
1,"Clean fun casino with a hearty buffet. Well-priced and good food. Recommended as a dependable buffet, especially for a casual lunch."
1,"Once again I love selecting great places for dining. Mr. Lucky's @ the Hard Rock Hotel was a winner. Too full to take pictures, this was a great hangover remedy spot. Our server was attentive and on point. We all enjoyed the variety of breakfast dishes we ordered. Sure, some of the items are a lil over priced for a diner type of restaurant, but hull-oh you're in Las Vegas, enjoy and get over it! We sure did!! Another to mark on our return list."
1,Pretty chill relaxed bar. Although I have seen first hand what happens when you piss off the bartender Robin.(Wouldn't recommend it) Great wings for Monday night football. Good specials.
0,"This place was horrible.  The waiters were decent, but they brought us the wrong items and gave us a hard time when we wanted the right ones.  The pasta was also inedible and when we tried to send it back, after they had taken it away, they told us if we wanted a replacement dish we would have to pay for both dishes.  We asked to talk to the manager, who is also the owner.  He refused 2 times to talk to us, until we relayed that we would be posting a review on Yelp.  Then he came over and agreed not to charge us for the wrong meals, which had already been removed.  Horrible customer service.  And we still had to pay for our drinks and they never offered to send us the right food."
0,"My jerk chicken was not as flavorful as it should be, and I prefer heavy gravy, and this was dry. It seemed as if it weren't marinated and all the flavor was right at the surface, just from the spice rub. The breast meat was fairly dry. The peas and rice, despite asking for extra gravy, were almost completely dry as well. They didn't have any braised cabbage, which I would consider to be a staple at a Jamaican place.\n\nI guess I would go again and try the oxtails, but only if I were already in the neighborhood. I'm forever spoiled by Caribbean Citchen in Detroit."
0,"Yeah, this wasn't the highlight of my recent outings with my kids.  There was so much wrong that I'll just try to sum it up.  \n\nFirstly, I came here with my neighbor and husband and all our collective kids.  We arrived as they opened and we parked in the parking area right in front of the SkyPark.   And despite that when we left we discovered that we got a warning in the form of a parking map on our car window implying that we weren't supposed to park there if we were attending the church next door; what the heck?? \n\n We went in and I had to sign a waiver that basically said that if my kids kill themselves here on a broken spring, torn fabric, etc. even if it's clearly the fault or failure of SkyPark, that I won't hold them liable for anything, ever, period.  In fact, I'm fairly sure that if one of their employees had snapped and whipped out a machine gun and killed everyone I would have also signed away my rights to legal recourse for that event too.   It definitely not a litigious type, but when the establishment is going out of their way to say no matter how badly screwed up our equipment is, if something happens with our haphazard, poorly maintained equipment it's not on them I get very suspicious and it makes me hyper vigilant about everything.  Indeed I saw reason to be hyper vigilant too.  There was evidence that this place is poorly maintained and struggling, badly.  I saw torn spring guards, ripped trampolines, AC units dripping condensation into 55 gallon trash cans, caution tape draped across whole sections that were off limits, and evidence of general deferred maintenance everywhere.  \n\nI directed my kids to the least threating looking area: a foam pit in the back corner, and made a mental note not to come back here.  Then the kids announced they were hungry so I ventured to the almost bare concession stand in the back and asked about the pizza for $14 they advertised on the marquee above the concession stand.  The bored employee texting on his cell phone looked up long enough to tell me that I needed to just call Mama Mia Pizza in the shopping center and order one since that's where they order their pizzas from anyway.  Confused, I confirmed with him that the process to order a pizza for my family though the SkyPark concession stand was just to call Mamma Mia Pizza and order it myself?  Yep.  That's correct.   Okay, so I'll call Mamma Mia Pizza....  (Review continued at Mamma Mia Pizza)"
0,"Thai Chili was a bit of a disappointment for us... It seems like we might have had an isolated incident given the positive reviews others have given it.  The drunken noodles seemed tasteless, and the spiciness was all over the place, (mine was supposed to be the spiciest, but wasn't spicy at all).  The BBQ Chicken was great, just hard to eat. \n\nThe service lacked a little bit, one waiter for all the tables doesn't seem sufficient... but at least there was a cute hostess ;-)"
1,"My new favorite place for my morning shake in Scottsdale. My 2nd time walking through the door they remembered me by name. That is very impressive. Great shakes, and friendly people! A must go to place."
0,"Typically Vegas!\nIt tries to be a high end restaurant but doesn't follow the rules nor the etiquette of what one would expect in a fine dining establishment.  I would suggest table cloths and a dress code.  I didn't need to see all of the notches in the tables neither did I need to see young men dressed in Hurley t-shirts, plaid shorts, and flippy-floppys.  \""Dude, are you sure it's ok to eat steak, it hasn't been forty-five minutes since we've been out of the pool?\""  Oh the future of America,  sometimes I'm glad I'll be dead.\nBack to the restaurant.\nI ordered the wild game trio with a side of foie gras.  I received dry meat and no goose liver.  Oh well.  My partner had the bison ribeye and said that it was pretty good and well cooked.  Good for her, since we used her MyVegas points to get $75 off.  We also had the creamed spinach and the truffle mac and cheese.  I thought they were ok, my partner gave them two thumbs up.  If she wasn't lying here next to me I'd tell her to get her own yelp account.  But she had the coupon and she also has the \""Hey-nanu-nanu\""  and if I want to keep dipping my meat into her sauce I'd best behave.\nAnyway back to the restaurant.\nWe also had the soup trio: lobster bisque, onion and leek, and wagyu chili.  Chili was nice and spicy, the lobster bisque was more bisque than lobster, and the onion leek soup was not as smooth as anticipated.  We also had the short rib ravioli, they were good, but we just wished that they were warmer.\nFor dessert we had the trio.  Chocolate cake (souffle), cheesecake, and creme brulee.  The creme brulee was excellent and came with a flaky buttery cookie that would make a Dane weep!\nMy recommendation if you have a MyVegas coupon go and try it out.  I would suggest other options if one had to pay full price."
0,"Ummm, can I have a little Mexican food with my salt? \n\nHoly crap! This food is over salted and waaaaaay over seasoned. I went here and ordered a veggie bowl thingy and I did not like it at all. The peppers and onions (fajitas) were way over cooked and tasted like they were sitting there all day. The guac was bland and over salted, and the lettuce wasn't crunchy. The food was luke warm and really not impressive at all. \n\nI will say, their chips are really good. Maybe get nachos or something?"
1,By far the best Indian cuisine I've had in Charlotte.  Far better than Woodlands or Saffron.  The lunch buffet is fine (and a good deal for the price) but their dinners are quite a bit better.
1,"Do Swiss Army Knives have a fondue fork that folds\naway into the knife? They should. While nobody yodelled\nfor us this definitely is the place for lovers of cheese\nand chocolates. Everybody kept asking what was being \ncelebrated. For the price of the meal it sure seems like\nyou need a reason to splurge to even walk through the\ndoor. We all had a pretty good time regardless. I'm not\nsure if all locations are like this but you probably \nwant to make a reservation if you are coming in on a weekend.\n  So the most popular way of enjoying a meal at The Melting\nPot is the four course deal. You get cheese fondue, salad,\nan Entree and dessert (chocolate fondue). I must say that\nfor a lot of people by the time the third course is done, \nthat is pretty much it. You can tone down the amount of food\nto fit the actual amount your group can handle eating. Even\nif you have four people in your group, you can order the salads\nfor 2 or the entrees for 3. That helps a lot in terms of\nportion control. When I was there, even the final dessert which \nwe ordered for one seemed to be a lot. \n   So you start off with a cheese fondue - you can choose from\nSpinach Artichoke (Fontina and Butterkase with spinach and\nartichoke hearts), Fiesta Cheese (aged cheddar with lager beer, \njapaleno peppers and salsa), Cheddar Cheese (aged cheddar and\nEmmenthaler Swiss with lager beer, garlic, and seasonings),\nWisconsin Trio Cheese (Fontina and Butterkase with buttermilk\nbleu cheese, white wine, scallions, and sherry), Traditional\nSwiss Cheese (Gruyere and Emmenthaler Swiss with white wine, \ngarlic, nutmeg, lemon and Kirschwasser) and finally the Big\nNight Out Seasonal Cheese. The waiter comes and sets up a fondue\npot and mixes the cheese and all the ingredients which you can\nthen dip breads, fresh vegetables and apples into. This is sort\nof like an appetizer so there's only one plate for everyone to \nget items to dip from. \n   Then you have a choice of salads for the second course - The\nMelting Pot House Salad, Spinach Mushroom Salad, Caesar Salad,\nCalifornia Salad, and Big Night Out Salad. These are rather big\nportions for a salad so if you have a small capacity you might\nwant to share rather than have each person getting their own salad.\n   Then we get to the entrees. This is the fun part because you\ndo your own cooking. First, you have to choose a cooking style.\nPretty much one for the whole group. You can choose from Coq au\nVin (Burgundy wine with fresh herbs, spices, and mushrooms), Court\nBouillon (vegetable broth with herbs and spices), Bourguignonne\n(cholestrol-free canola oil), and Mojo (bouillon with fresh garlic\nand citrus). For the entrees themselves, you have all sorts of \ncombinations of filet mignon, shrimp, salmon, chicken, sirloin,\npork tenderloin, duck, potstickers, ravioli, asparagus, tofu, \nedamame, artichoke hearts, Andouille sausage, onion rings, lobster\ntail, and Portobello mushrooms.\n   The cooking times were given for each type of food:\nPoultry, Pork: 2 1/2 minutes\nSeafood: 2 minutes\nBeef: 1 1/2 minutes\nEverything else: 1 minute\n   I used my iPhone's timer and used both fondue forks at a time\nto try and get the cooking down to a science. A little silly and\nfun at the same time. But by the end of it, I was stuffed. Our\ngroup decided we'd have only one person's portion of the final\ncourse - dessert. \n   For the final course, chocolate fondue (dessert) you get a \nchoice of Big Night Out Seasonal Chocolate, The Original (milk\nchocolate, peanut butter), Yin & Yang (dark and white chocolate),\nCookies 'n Cream Marshmallow Dream (dark chocolate topped with\nmarshmallow cream flambeed and topped with Oreo cookies), Flaming\nTurtle (milk chocolate, caramel and candied pecans flamb\u00e9ed), Pure\nChocolate (dark, white, or milk), Bananas Foster (Bananas and a \nhint of cinnamon swirled in white chocolate), and Chocolate S'mores\n(milk chocolate with marshmallow cream, flamb\u00e9ed and topped with \nbits of graham crackers). We opted for the Cookies 'n Cream Marshmallow\nDream. They brought a plate of strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, Rice \nKrispies Treats, marshmallows, pound cake and brownies to dip in.\nIt was definitely decadent and filled us all to the brim.\n   Parking is easy to find. It's in the same mall as Zendejas Grill and \nNext Coffee. The restaurant itself is right across from Sylvan."
1,"I highly recommend this cleaners. I brought in a very soiled prom dress and it turned out INREDIBLE. !! Looks brand-new, The people who run this cleaners are the nicest and gave such great service. They acted like they truley cared., what a pleasant surprise these days.  And the prices are so resonable.."
0,"Let me start with the positive: Original Picasso paintings adorn the walls, the decor is very elegant, fresh flowers fill the tables, and we got the best table in the house -- with a great view of the Bellagio fountains, which made it all the more romantic. \n\nNow, moving on to the mediocre: the food just wasn't out of this world. I think Picasso relies on the paintings to keep people coming. However, they need to up the ante on their food because I was not impressed. \n\nI was also irked by how people were taking pictures of the paintings. NOT cool. Have some class, please?!"
0,Slowest drive thru in the world. \n\nWorst customer service and people who do not care. Go to another
0,"After one of the people from this store walked around our furniture showroom and passed out her business cards to my clients, I DEFINITELY will not be shopping here. That was low. Not sure why this posted 18 days ago, this happened about a year ago."
1,"I can't believe I never knew about this place! It was a pharmacy back in the 1920's and now is a soda and ice cream place. The soda counter and everything is original, it's almost like stepping back in time!!! There are even the old phone booths ,and ask about the water line from when it was flooded long long ago! The hubby had a peppermint soda with a scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream that was really good, and we had a panini and chili that were also tasty. I hope to go back for more food soon!"
1,"Good food. Very knowledgeable staff. Great drinks. Cool ambiance. Atmosphere was a little muted, especially for a Saturday night. Not that many people there and the tables are spread far apart. Overall though, a great restaurant for Scottsdale."
1,"Exceptional restaurant in Charlotte and much better than a lot of the locally owned ones.  Service was outstanding, as was the food.  Here's a rundown of our order.\n\nStarters\nSteamed Littleneck Clams--These are fantastic and are bathing in a garlic/herb cream sauce that you will hang onto to sop your bread up with.  Very fresh clams and a decent portion for a starter--about 15 clams.\nRaw Oysters--I had a tasting menu of 3 varieties and found the Canadian oysters the best.  My favorite was the Beau Rivage.  Some of the oysters were very undersized and some were oversized.  It would be nice if they evened out the sizes for sharing reasons.\n\nMains\nBlackened Mahi-Mahi...the fish in the dish was fantastic.  The sauce was a bit too much I felt and dominated the fish.  It was a spicy tomato sauce.  Would not order again.  The rice side was also dismal.\nSea Bass-Perfect.  This is the opposite of the mahi mahi because in this dish the fish is the star and not the sauce...although the gremolata butter is subtle and fantastic.  Sides of mash and asparagus and carrots were great.  Truly a great plate of food.\n\nDessert\nApple Upside Down Pie....fantastic.  Will disappear in less than 5 minutes guaranteed.\n\nThis is a really nice restaurant that does most things right.  I look forward to going back and trying more of the menu.  All the ingredients are super fresh and I think I would recommend ordering something that is light on the sauce and stars the fresh seafood."
1,"I thought the Pizzeria @ the Cosmo was a pretty plain name for a restaurant like \""Nail Shop\"" or \""Tattoo\"", and I usually hate that sort of thing but there is nothing plain or ordinary about this pizza on the third floor. It's located right near Marquee and is a neighbor to the upscale Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill. \n\nAlthough on it's yelp page it says business hours begin at 9am, this place didn't have it's doors open at 10:50 AM and so we had to wait about 10-15 minutes for the place to open. The security guard commented on the fact that this place usually opens late, especially on Sunday so you might want to consider that before fully nursing that hangover to come here on time if the employees aren't going to be here. \n\nIt has a long hallway of records in picture frames and it's almost anti-climatic because when you reach the end of the hallway you enter this small space with no seating area. The service was friendly for the most part, except the female cashier who definitely seems to hate her job. \n\nAs far as I could see they don't go out of their way to explain their selection, you just sidle up to the register and area and look at their pizza options. There was cheese / pepperoni / the ricotta & garlic / sausage & bell pepper. It's about $4 a slice, not the cheapest but nothing in Vegas comes for free. \n\nThe ricotta & garlic was AMAZING. It had an extra crisp to it that the bell pepper & sausage seemed to lack, I'm hoping it wasn't because the pepper and sausage was not as fresh. Regardless I'm not usually a big fan of ricotta but blended with the garlic and crisp crust I found a new flavor combination to admire. The bell pepper & sausage didn't blow me away as much and I probably wouldn't get it again. \n\n\nSo to quickly sum it up \n- Don't expect a fine dining experience\n- approx $4 a slice\n- Ricotta pizza is the one to get."
1,"Best fish joint in town. Worth every penny. Here is what I ate tonight:\n\nKettle One Martini Shaken on the Rocks - Great start\n\nSashimi Platter - BEST ahi tuna in the Valley, great poke, amazing marlin\n\nShrimp Cocktail - Perfect HUGE shrimp\n\nShrimp and Crab Chopped Salad - One of the best salads I've had in a while.

1,"I'm currently here at the City Center, walking around and thought it would be a good idea to review this city inside the city on the blackberry. \n\nWe entered through the back valet at the Aria building, the valets just let you park and take your keys. Quick and easy. The first thing you will see after the entrance is, quite possibly, the best and most creative display of modern America. If you're tired of the same old European influenced deco, you'll like how the City Center is done up. It's very dark, however the floors are appropriately lit. \n\nThe 2nd thing you will see is Jean Philippe's Patisserie. The bakery is outstanding. A huge plethora of different sorbets and cakes and chocoloates. I'll upload the impressive chocolate statue display in a bit. \n\nThe sports bar is outstanding, it's comfortably spacious; located nezt to the floors. Walking around, you'll notice the unique styling that the MGM guys were after. Completely apart from everywhere else. Should be fun watching the Vikings/Bears game tonight. Vikings are -8 instead of 7 now :(\n\nOnce outside there's an awesome waterfall on a wall decoration that extends to the upper tram area that can take you to the Crystal building and the Bellagio. We took it to the Crystal building. Inside this complex is where all the shopping is done at. The shops here are pretty much what you would see at SCP, Gucci, LV, Tiffanys, etc... For the most part it's all jewelry. The mall is about 90 percent complete with the 10 percent visible from certain areas. The Tiffanys here has excellent service, however a smaller selection than south coast. \n\nRight now we're walking around the Mandarin Orient; not much here as it's strictly a place you either live at or are staying at, BUT downstairs you will see a lovely bakery called Amore. I ate a few macarons and a caramel gelato. \n\nThe macarons are fanfreakintastic and are better than paulette. Yeah! That's right, I said that. \n\nWalking back to Aria now to get something to eat. Brb\n\nBtw this place is huge but after walking around it for an hour and a half it's not THAT big"
1,"I was meeting my mother in Vegas and wanted to find a hotel that was convenient and not intimidating.  The Aria is a good option for people who want to check in, enjoy the perks of the hotel, pick from the many restaurants on the premies, and not be overwhelmed by all the beautiful people and 20-year-olds you'd find at, say The Palms.  Very comfortable, good service, nice pool.  Love \""Liquid,\"" the poolside bar with a great DJ.  Not crazy about the scented air (vanilla in the lobby, musk en route to the pool).  Cool fountains out front.  Rooms very very comfortable with amazing views.  I didn't find any of the automated things (curtains, lights, tv) confusing, as some other posters have.  As with all plush hotels, you can't use the mini 'fridge because it's completely full of honor bar snacks (if you could call it an \""honor bar\"" when it's actually booby-trapped to bill your room when you remove a snack--even if you put it right back).  Great bathroom, lighting, beds.  Everything is brand new and squeaky clean.  I'm not a big casino person, but the casino seemed kind of dead.  Good restaurants of various stripes, but no good bar other than Liquid at the pool.  No good night club.  Free valet parking."
0,"Please explain to me the rationale behind having a happy hour that is limited to the bar or outside patio when there are only three (count them on one hand) three customers in the entire place?  The entire restaurant is small and I could hold the hand of the person sitting at the bar while I sit in the restaurant section,  yet, I am not allowed to benefit from the happy hour menu for my drink. If you want to split hairs over this one, you can do it with someone else.  I will not be spending my money on a place that is petty."
0,"Went for the first time today after constantly driving by.  First impression was that it was too dark, I had to shine my phone onto the menu to be able to read it.  Then the real issues started with the service being the biggest one.  Took a good twenty minutes to order and then an eternity to get my tacos.  They were okay, nothing great though.  Server came by one to all if o wanted a refill however never brought it out.  Between the mediocre food and terrible service I don't think I'll go back."
1,First you are greeted and made to feel very much at home when you arrive. Then you partake in the most flavorful and delicious food! Fresh ingredients make the food so amazing! The Brie and pesto fries and the brussel sprouts with arugula pesto are my favorites! The crepes are delicate and flavorful and just superb. We tried the ham and gruyere and spinach and mushroom crepes.  I can't wait to return and try some other delicious meals here!!
0,Store puts labels incorrectly and do not stand by the label price.
0,"I am just appalled, just appalled....\nI am here for the just for laughs comedy festival as a guest. So yes we got the room for free and a corporate rate for the extra night we added, so I should not complain. But I am going to.  Apparently the workers are on strike. I understand your situation,and I am sorry for your predicament. Should I pay the consequence for your dispute? Isn't this called \""the hospitality business\""?No bed service, no towel service, no pool, the wall paper is peeling off of the wall,the coffee maker of the cheapest kind,(I've been to less prestigious places in the US and they had  Koering espresso machines in their room), plush bedding is advertised, no 400 counts here and a hole in my top sheet... I could continue with how horrendous checking in was but I will not...I just want to remind you what Hospitality, hospitalite, in French, just in case, means. It means to go above and beyond the guests' needs. \nI will make sure to ask for a refund as soon as I get home."
0,"Wish I had read the reviews here before going to this lousy restaurant. Most of the things we didn't like about our visit other reviewers have already mentioned in recent reviews: our table was all sticky even though we were among the first customers for the day; the hard chairs were uncomfortable, if you're not tall your feet will be dangling when you sit; our nachos were good but my friend said his chicken fajitas were really lacking in flavour and my beef chimichanga was not even the way it was described in the menu -no cheese, no sour cream, only a tiny bit of sauce underneath and inside half the filling was the same red rice that was served as a side order on my plate. Why would somebody want so much rice? This was a very poorly composed entr\u00e9e. How about getting rid of some of that rice and instead have some retried beans, cheese, sour cream, salsa, salad or something instead of all that rice? \nAnd you better like that bright red sauce they use because they seem to use it on everything; the nachos, the rice, the sauce on a stuffed tortilla. \nAfter I asked for my missing sour cream it didn't get brought to our table until we had both given up on wanting to eat this overpriced, bland meal. \nOh yeah, the tall Margarita slush drinks tasted weak, too. If you want a good one with lots of Tequila at a good price try the Circus Circus casino. \nWe were kicking ourselves thinking that we could of had a pretty good steak dinner somewhere else for what we paid at this joint, and we had a Groupon too. Never again; you've been warned."
1,"I do love me some chicken shack. \n\nThis place has some really great fried chicken, but what sets them apart is their expansive sauce selection. My personal favorite being the honey bbq and hot bbq. Their fries are also just amazing. \n\nMy only one complaint is that the chicken isnt always consistent. At times their chicken can be very chewy, and not so easy to eat. I would say I experience this about  one out every three or four visits. Thus why I have not been dining there as much lately. \n\nWhen their chicken is good its a 5 star place, but with the inconsistency I can only give them 4."
0,"***WATCH OUT***\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I recently adopted a 2 month old lab/mix puppy. We adopted her Saturday and were  told we were not able to pick her up until the following Monday because she had to be spayed. The day we met her she had several ticks and we were told she had a Frontline treatment. 3 days after having her we found more ticks... ONE BEING LESS THAN AN INCH AWAY FROM HER SURGICAL AREA. I find it disgusting how this facility keeps their pets. The facility told us they would not bathe her before her surgery when she was filthy and covered in ticks. \n\nWe took her to our vet and she now has kennel cough. \n\nPlease be prepared for kennel cough, ticks and vet bills when you adopt from the county animal shelter."
0,Jose Andres is always a name you associate with good and original food but this time was not what we expected \nActually not fusion is Chinese or Mexican and ok food \nGuacamole was good and very limited menu for someone allergic to shellfish so that alone is not to Mexican
0,"Yuck. A long wait. The place seemed dirty and smelled bad. Nice staff, but understaffed. And the food was bad in Japan! How do you mess up edamame? We left hungry because the first three dishes ranged from icky to so-so. The beer was cheap."
0,"I would highly warn against renting any of this company's units.  After 5 years of renting with them, the service went from bad to worse. The rentals are affordable but their service is ridiculous.  From no air conditioning for days on end, to roof leaks in a childs room that went ignored in monsoon season.  I would not wish them on anyone. Renters beware."
0,"Eh. This place is \""fine\"". I'm not terribly impressed with it. I could probably get better breakfast somewhere else. Plus its ALWAYS so so so busy in there. I like that they have a ton of vegetarian options. Which is rare for breakfast places. But meh. Its not amazing food."
0,Not really good Italian food but it's a great place to pick up a date if your 80 years old.
0,"I came here with my family just a few hours ago. Even though we only eat halal, I expected a lot more out of this place. My mom had a voucher from restaurant.com for 25$ and we had to buy a minimum of 37.5$ to use it which was no big deal for the 4 of us. But when we went to go order our food, the owner told my mom and I that in order for us to use the voucher, we had to each buy our own drink or water ($8.00 total) and then added another 15% gratuity tax. I looked at the receipt after I read some other post just a few moments ago, and the cashier did charge us 8.99$ for a gyro that is listed as 5.99$ on the menu. Even after eliminating the voucher, we handed another 36$.\n\nAs for the food, it was okay. Nothing spectacular to make me go running back in there again...ever. If you are looking for better priced and AMAZING food, I highly recommend Kabob Express (Eastern & Tropicana) and Kabob Korner (downtown LV). The service is amazing, the food is even better and it's all worth it for the price!  \n\nNo offense to the owner, but you are running a BUSINESS. Do not tell me that you opened up your restaurant in front of the university so that students such as myself who are looking for halal food will have a place to eat. If you aren't willing to work at keeping your customers happy, we will find another place to eat."
1,"First visit to an eye doctor in a couple of years and I was a little apprehensive.  First impression was \""Wow\"" the place is immaculate and the staff was very friendly.  My time with Dr. Mumford was very thorough and she was awesome, very nice, very knowledgeable and very patient with all of my questions and concerns.  I'm currently trying a new pair of contacts and can't wait to go back and pick out some super cute glasses too.  Great experience, I definitely recommend Innovative Eye Care to anyone looking for an upgraded eye care experience!"
1,"Chef Michael Miller prepared our menu for the night. He chose all if his best dishes for us to try. Every dish was truly a delightful surprise. We had no idea what was coming next...which made it so fun! We started off with a crispy shrimp ball, followed by ahi tuna. Next was the Kobe beef ravioli, which was out of this world! We ended with NY strip steak served with truffle Mac & Cheese and broccoli served on cute skillets. It was the best Mac and cheese I have ever had! Of course we ended with some dosants (aka cronuts), and a variety of rich desserts. I can not thank you enough for the amazing service and food. Thank you, Joe, for the excellent service!"
0,"Use the bathroom BEFORE you eat. I guarantee you will never eat there again! It's disgusting and looks like it's never cleaned. This goes for other areas of the restaurant as well. If you're unfortunately seated near the front blinds, don't look at the greasy filth on them. I'll never eat here again and have turned all my chinese buffet friends off to it. I'm told you about your bathrooms several times ... CLEAN UP YOUR ACT Hunan VIII."
0,"I am writing this review for the benefit of vegeterians.I have been to this place twice.The menu card says stir fry egg plant and the item comes with minced pork.Second time, I repeatedly told them not to add egg/meat/pork/chicken/shrimp.half way through eating it, I had meat piece on my spoon.The food might taste well, but this is not the place for vegeterians. I will never go back to this place."
1,"While the toddler play area is definitely not clean, I bring my 21 month old here for swimming lessons. We have been impressed so far! We have been at least 15 times and Nicole has been the instructor. All of the instructors seem well-liked. The registration desk is a little unorganized and you DEFINITELY need to pay attention to your bill. Overall we really enjoy water wings!"
0,"bought a restaurant.com coupon for this place . \nordered the chicken lula & kebob  9.95 $  and \nbeef lula & chicken kabob  10.95 $\nthe portion was really big and the food looked good , but unfortunately it was completely tasteless ."
0,"I'm afraid the use of the word 5-star is thrown around here willy-nilly.  The word 5-star invokes opulence, star-treatment, flawless customer service and impeccable rooms and grounds.  Perhaps, at one point in time the Venetian ruled along the strip as the epitome of 5-star, but I don't think that's the case here anymore.  \n\nThe city has suffered at the hands of this economic downturn, and hotels have responded, primarily by reducing their staff.  Venetian was clearly understaffed, from front desk, to bell-hops and luggage staff and especially the Concierge desk, they were always ill-equipped to deal with the crowds during high traffic times.\n\nAs other reviews have mentioned, the atmosphere is ruined by the perfumed scent that is pumped into the facility. It is positively nauseating and the smell is so strong and so empowering that you don't want to enter the reception area. Also, another atmosphere annoyance: management insists on playing the Phantom of the Opera soundtrack on a loop in the elevators - (that marketing scheme will only hurt you, who wants to see that musical after it's been blasting in your ears for the last four days?)\n\nRestaurants on site are better than average to awful (i.e. its food court), with the best one being Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bistro located in the Venezia Tower. Their complimentary breakfast is served in a tiny two floor room. Their continental breakfast offers pastries and croissants with some sorry looking bananas and apples, along with self-serve coffee and juice. \n\nThe little food that is offered is okay but not sufficient for a place that bills itself as a 5-star establishment. The space itself is cramped and cavernous with only a few tables where you can sit and see the view. Here, they are also understaffed with very few tending to replenishing the food and drink and cleaning/turning over the tables.\n\nTheir pool area is also not terribly impressive. Between the Venetian and the Palazzo, the area offers four pool areas. There is visible ugly construction obscuring the sky. Their towel service is nice, offering both a chair towel and a swimming towel. There are far too few hot-tubs that are either over-run with children or filled to annoying capacity. If you want to relax, sit far away from the Tao Beach Club that plays club music at the maximum volume level. \n\nThough the lounge chairs aren't as nice in the Palazzo pool area, the mood and atmosphere is decidedly calmer. With no food service to speak of, drink service was sporadic, we ended up mostly going up to the bar to fill our orders. Cocktails $10 a pop, beer $7, wine $8.\n\nAs I'm sure you've figured out by now, there is nothing reminiscent of Venice at the Venetian. The Grand Canal Shoppes, along with the indoor/outdoor Canal along with St-Mark's square is bordering on Disney-cheesy (but it's Vegas, so it's to be expected?)\n\nThe rooms, their size is what saves this place. We stayed in the Bella Suites and these rooms were big. Two flat screen t.v.s, one in the bedroom and then the other in the living room suite. Sizeable bathrooms, separate toilets.  Plenty of room to pre-game most importantly and to get ready for a night out on the town. Complimentary toiletries weren't anything special - bitter orange. Nice shower pressure, but both towels and robes were overly starch-y and old. \n\nThe furniture has seen better days, and there were a few items that needed tending (i.e. towel rack was loose, some light bulbs were burned out and needed replacing, fleece blanket had a huge hole in it) Maid service always came early in the morning - and they were seemingly thorough, except for one day when a cleaning glove was left behind on top of our bathroom sink.\n\nWith all the new hotels (Westin, Hilton) offering plush bedding and \""heavenly\"" beds, you think the nicer hotels in Vegas would follow suit. Not so. The mattresses were lumpy, some dipping in the middle (clearly needing an overhaul) The pillows were flat and not plush. I would have preferred at the very least, a duvet. Most of us slept badly.\n\nYour value for the money was decent, but only when the total cost of the stay was split seven ways. If I would do it again, I'd spend extra money and stay somewhere fancier or more modern (Think Bellagio, Wynn, or newer properties). I would not return here.\n\nThe added charge of a daily $18 resort fee for access to the gym and a daily newspaper that you must obtain yourself (both items which we never took advantage of) was ridiculous and unnecessary.  Not to mention when I elected to do a quickie checkout (to avoid an hour long wait) by filling out a form, I never received an itemized bill of my charges."
1,"Ok, so I'm being slightly generous.  This should actually be a 3.5 stars, and not 4.\n\nThe Gyros was decent, the tzatziki sauce was good, my problem was that the tomatoes were cut too big and hard to eat, being big chunks in there.  The fries were ok.  I guess I should explore the menu more next time around, if there is a next time around.\n\nIt's relatively cheap, and a decent break from all the buffet in vegas."
0,"This place has gone down hill, this was my 3rd visit and my last.  I have nicer towels for my car and a little bleach wouldn't hurt.  The receptionist Heather was the least helpful person I've come across.  The saving grace was Bryce, nice guy, super helpful."
1,"Hands down my favourite Fishmonger in Edinburgh. Why?\n\n1. The fish are fresh and there is a wide variety. \n\n2.The value for money is great, mostly because you can taste the difference from supermarket fish BY FAR\n\n3. The staff are helpful. You tell them what you're making and they tell you what to do always with a smile! \n\n4. Location. I pick up my fish and then go next door and pick out my veg to go with it. How ideal! \n\nThats all. \n\nRead the earlier reviews, gotta try out this sushi on saturday mornings!"
1,Amazing!!!! I could spend hours here sampling the produce and looking at all of the gorgeous foods. There is nothing like this in the U.S. (that I know of)
0,Breakfast was cold and coffee was old.  Eggs tasted like they came from a powder. Not what we expected at $30 per person. Enough said. Yuck!
0,"Worst post office ever. I've never seen more than two people working the counter, and I've never seen fewer than a dozen people waiting in line (this is not an exaggeration). The employees give incorrect information, and they are rude while doing it! Go to Paper Crazy on 12th Street if you need to send something."
0,"Being Peruvian, I wanted to find good authentic Peruvian food. We ordered the Jaela, a seafood platter and the Lomo Saltado, a steak and rice dish. The lomo saltado had an overwhelming taste of wine which is in all my life of eating Peruvian food, I have never had lomo saltado cooked in wine. Highly uncharacteristc. The jaela had pieces of octopus that were uncooked. In fact, half of the pieces of seafood I got in the platter were uncooked or chewy in texture but not in a good way. Not saying that the restaurant was awful, but if someone is expecting TRUE authentic Peruvian food, this is not the place I would go too."
0,"Only reason we stayed here was because a friend got comped room from gambling. I repeat, this is the only reason you should ever be here. \n\nWe arrived at 7am and were told we could not check in until 9am, which is understandable. There were 7 of us, so we tried to book an additional room for the day until we were told it would be $160 for the room, and could not check in until 4pm. This was ridiculous considering the quality of the hotel, and the fact  that it was a tuesday morning. (I called circus-circus and got a rate of $80). We ended up upgrading our comped room for the penthouse for $140. The interior decorations are cheesy and dated, with a tacky \""asian\"" theme.  \n\nFor some reason, I did not get the usual  feeling of excited anticipation you get when you press the PH elevator button in a las vegas hotel. When we got off on our floor, they were undergoing renovations and there were tiles hanging off the ceiling, debris on the carpets, etc. The room itself was okay. Spacious, with 2 bedrooms, a bar area, living room, and slept 7 comfortably. However, I've seen better bathrooms in a motel 6. Just a toilet and a tiny stall shower in each one. The balcony was a joke! it was made of concrete, quite dirty and overlooked the parking lot. \n\nIn the end, the service is what bothered me the most. The staff was very lazy; we went  to the concierge to ask them to send some things to our room but she was too lazy to do it so she asked us to go to our room and call down! In addition, we wanted some hot water to make instant noodles and they wanted to charge us $6. Thats right, $6 for a thermos of hot water! \n\nStay clear away from this place, unless you get a comped room. If that's the case then just stick it out and spend most your time at the other hotels like we did."
1,"I really am a fan. I stayed here for a week and it was a pleasure. \n\nThis is not a \""I'm gonna party\"" hotel but caters more to business travellers such as conference attendees. I have seen some honeymooners. Room is clean and pretty. And spacious enough to work though the table has an odd shape. I love the stand up shower and the tub just outside it. You can soak day's work in peace. And when you need to go, the toilet has its own \""room\"" with doors. Bonus. \n\nUnlike some hotels on the strip, cardio room is free. Zip. No charge. You need to pay more though if you need to use the weight room. \n\nInternet speed is decent. \n\nThe restaurants inside the hotel are superb - I tried four of them. Buffet is decent but not great. \n\nWhat I like most about this hotel is that it is not chaotic. The elevator is far enough from the casino and far enough from the Vegas crowd. You are not greeted by gamblers in the morning and drunk teenagers at night. Or children. \n\nChildren are fun except when they're rowdy. And the noise of slot machines make them rowdy. \n\nI will recommend this to anyone who will go to Vegas for work. But not to vacationers - too far from the center of the strip. From Caesar Palace - cab ride was $15. \n\nI am giving it a four for service, cleanliness, room aesthetics,  staff's attentiveness (generally) and somewhat peacefulness (Vegas-style).\n\nDid I mention that there's a wave pool?"
0,"I had the very bland fish tacos and my husband had the fried chicken. The service was friendly but the food is was very disappointing, because it didn't have much favor. We asked our server for various sauces trying to add taste to our meal but it didn't improve much. We won't be back."
0,"Went there for a date night.  We did the call ahead seating which worked out great!!  We got seated at our table and the drink host was fast and efficient.  Our waiter however was not.  We ordered the hot sour soup bowl.  When it came, one of the plastic spoons had a noodle of some kind dried up in it.  I pointed it out to our server and he took the spoon (which was in the bowl).  I asked if we could have another complete set.  No apology what so ever.  I had to ask twice for a refill of my soda.  My wife asked how long for a couple spring rolls.  He said 5 min.  15 min later he asks if we were ready for desert.  No egg rolls had arrived yet!  He went to get them.  We waited another 15 min for the check.  Keep in mind all our dishes were picked up.  Finally it came and again no apology for any part of the poor service.  I placed my cc'd down and waited..... And waited..... And then some more.  My wife and I gave up and came up with the cash between both of us.  I did have to go to the bar and ask for change.  That part was fast and efficient!  The bartender even picked up I was a little upset.  He asked if I wanted to speak to a mgr but I declined as we just wanted out.  Well a mgr did find us.  She apologized for everything and did a great job.  I just don't think we'll be going back to that location anytime soon."
1,"First time here. Had crispy chicken for lunch. $8.99 gets you soup, rice, pancit, 2 shanghai lumpia, and half a chicken!!! Did I mention HALF A CHICKEN??!! Needless to say, lunch was quite filling. The chicken skin was ultra crispy and meat was moist. The dipping sauce was similar to what you'd get from a Chinese restaurant when ordering roast duck. Will definitely be back to try other dishes. Coworker has bistek Tagalog and she said it was good as well as my other coworkers pork adobo. Will update once I try more dishes."
1,"This burger bar, a place I usually want to come visit when I visit Charlotte, offers up a pretty tasty burger, though not the best I've ever had. The reason I like it so much isn't because the actual burgers are that amazing, but because of the huge variety of stuff you can get on top of said burgers. It's amazing, and most turn out more deliciously than you can imagine. My favorite is the Frenchie, which is brie, apples, bacon, and garlic aioli on a turkey burger - which I almost always switch out for beef. There aren't many places you can get brie and apples on a burger, and I'm pretty obsessed with it. There are a billion other choices like that, or you can construct your own weird burger (the last time we went, a friend got grilled pineapple, queso, and bacon on a turkey burger... and she loved it). \n\nThe sides are also tasty, but not really the main draw for me. Everyone seems to like the sweet potato fries here, which I actually think are really bland without the sauce, and I like a good sweet potato fry that stands up without sauce. These don't. The regular fries are good, similar to Five Guys, as are the tater tots, which are pretty standard, but nice and crispy, which I appreciate. Ask for some sauces (chipotle ranch? yes.) to improve your potato-based experience.\n\nOK, now for a few cons -- it's always so crowded, and loud inside. Expect to wait in the parking lot for a parking space, and inside for a table unless you're incredibly lucky or come at like 11 am on a Tuesday. Because it's always so busy, the wait staff can be hit and miss too. Most of my experiences have been pretty good, once you actually sit down.\n\nWith regards to the actual meat, I feel they could improve in this area. They obviously don't grind their own sirloin, which is pretty surprising AND disappointing for a so-called burger bar. Because of this, you can't get a burger cooked less than medium. No favorite burger of mine is ever going to be more than medium-rare, so this is very sad for me. I do have to say that the beef burger was remarkably juicy for being cooked medium and not being fresh-ground. \n\nIn conclusion, if you're a burger purist seeking out the best burger on the planet, this place isn't going to have it. But if you're a burger adventurist and want to put all kinds of weird stuff on your burger, then you'll love it here. Worth a try for anyone."
1,"Amazing place! Where has it been all my life? I was visiting Vegas this past week for my cousin's wedding and my boyfriend and I couldn't find a place open past ten with reasonable food! So, we went to Margaritaville around the corner, which was only serving apps, and were told to check out the new places nearby The LinQ.\n\nWow, this place was brand new (only open three days at the time), had outrageously delicious food, had an amazing view of the gigantic Ferris wheel from the patio...I could really just go on and on. \n\nIf you go, sit on the upstairs patio. \n\nIf you like cider, try the pineapple!\n\nMy bf had a great steak and I ordered the Thai Noodle Salad. It was amazing and I wish the nearest Yard House was closer than Orlando (I live in Tampa, FL). I'd probably go once a week for sure."
1,"Cool setting, friendly staff, locally owned and supports local brews. \nDifferent nightly specials, like \""Moonshine Mondays.\"" and daily happy hours. \nFood is tasty and has a unique spin on traditional items like burgers, wings, etc. \nWill be a welcome addition to Gilbert."
1,"We came here after having Ramsay's Steak at Paris. That might have been our first mistake. We walked in on a Tuesday night at around 9:00 and they told us it would be 45 minutes. So we moseyed on over to Ramsay Pub and Grill and had a beer. We went back for our table and were seating in about 5 minutes. The first thing I noticed was that the waiters- all of them- were men in their 40's or 50's. Seriously. Such a lack of diversity is bizarre. Doesn't seem like a coincidence. Our server was nice, but not very helpful. We got the usual that everyone else on Yelp orders: tuna nachos, shrimp tamale and pork tenderloin. The food was all delicious, but not \""spectacular\"" and I wanted it to knock my socks off. Maybe since we had Ramsay's the night before, my expectations were too high? Hubby had a margarita, that was probably the most exciting part of the meal. I would like to come back and try lunch or brunch, as I saw some interesting items on the menu, plus not too many celebrity chef's restaurants do lunch."
1,"The fried mozzarella was awesome, I had the open faced turkey which was pretty good and my boyfriend loved the mac & cheese. Good beer and an excellent place to go to watch football."
1,"This really is foodie heaven for both shopping to cook at home but also to eat in.\n\nThe vegetables and fruit are fresh as they come and it is this produce that makes the delicious soups, salads and sandwiches they have in the cafe. You can also peruse a selection of recipe books which will inspire you to get cooking with all the hundreds of tasty products on sale in the shop. Anywhere else I would say it was cynical marketing but having met the owners and many of the staff it's clear that they are just really passionate about good quality food and want you to enjoy it too. \n\nAs well as food they also have a wide range of organic and natural toiletries and household products. \n\nOutside they have on sale plants and flowers that brighten up what would otherwise be some decking in a parking lot! So if it's nice enough to sit outside you should- it's great escapism from the city despite being next to a main road."
0,"We had 7pm reservations. Sat out on the balcony. Nice view of the area. The service started off very well. Had the 2010 Jordan Cabernet Sauvignon. It was a nice wine. Had the scallops as a starter. Very nicely done. Had the tomohawk rib eye and lobster surf-n-turf.  Very nice presentation. Lobster was excellent. Rib eye tasted kind of bland for what I paid.  Than they forgot about us. Requested support from other staff members but because we weren't their customer, they didn't care. \nIn order to get a 5 they need to finish what they started with good service and improve the taste of the steak. This dinner was too expensive for what I paid for."
1,"This was our first time here, even though my kids have been here once each with friends.  We were doing teppanyaki, since the kids love it.  Waitress, Lisa, was very nice and attentive.  The place was very slow, we were there at 6:00 on a Tuesday.  We ordered a California Roll and a salmon roll, for HH.  The rolls were tasty, but the rice wasn't sticky enough to hold the rolls together.  \n\nBut, our chef for our dinner was so entertaining!  The kids had a blast and the food was DELISH!  We had some special requests and he definitely adhered to them. My only negative was that most of our food was quite salty, but that's common with this type of food.  I need to remember to ask him to chill on the sauces next time.  With that being said, the prices were reasonable, compared to Benihana and the food really was delicious! I would definitely go back for some more Teppanayaki. I'm not the sushi pro at all."
0,"Came with a party of 8 waiting in their lounge area to be seated when all of a sudden I realize our orders were being taken and silverware being placed at waiting area. Ordered ceviche good but nothing at all special small for the price. Husband ordered 2 tacos and bowl of noodles which was tasty. I was left not full I asked waiter if we could have salsa &chips, which was brought out after asking for them you would expect automatic especially for a high priced restaurant. Salsa was not special. Food is Pricey for such a small amount of food. Was hungry after an hour and a half later."
0,"Friends and I decided to try out an Indian restaurant closer to our place rather than trek up to the reliably tasty Bombay Mahal. Big mistake. The waiter seemed annoyed at our requests (e.g., an order of channa with our samosas) and got a few things wrong, even though we clarified in both English and Hindi. The sauces were bland and overly oily, the paneer was dry (almost hard, really) and strangely sweet, and most of the dishes tasted the same. The best thing was actually the plain basmati rice. Next time we'll be going back up to Jean-Talon, even in a snowstorm."

1,"The restaurant was really nice and the waiters came around frequently asking how everything was. When you sit down, an iPad is delivered to your table where you can make meal/drink choices, awesome! My husband and I ordered the beef wellington for two and it was mouth watering delicious! We are going to have trouble finding one to top this, if it's even possible! Definitely recommend this restaurant if you have a couple hundred dollars to spare :)"
0,"I took my car in to get my brakes fixed because they were squeaking. The guy told me I didn't need new brake pads but I just needed them \""deglazed\"" well that was 100$ and they squeak worse than ever!!!! I took it back and he said he would re do it but if it still doesn't work I would have to buy new brake pads! So that original 100 I spent just went down the drain! My boyfriend told me what deglazing meant and it's like spraying a coat on there. And I got worked! They were just taking advantage of me because I'm female like most audio places do!"
0,"Horrible food (the most dry taco I have ever eaten and the enchilada was very chewy) and awful service, not to mention a giant cockroach walked right past us  to nibble on a piece of meat on the floor.  They didnt get our order right and we ended up having to eat it anyway because the waiter never came back to the table, then we had to look for him to pay the bill and then again to get our credit card back.  When we showed the manager the giant cockroach he just picked it up with a napkin and didnt even offer an apology.  I give them 6 months at most and then they will be out of business."
0,"I wish I could give this hotel ZERO stars.\n\nThe good:\n- Cool looking waterfall thing in the valet/entrance area\n- The king sized bed was really comfortable\n- Spa was good\n- Pool was cool\n- We walked right in to Haze\n- They discounted our room after acknowledging some of their general crapiness.\n- Cafe was pretty good... a little pricey though\n\nThe Bad:\n- It smelled like a 50 year old woman's perfume every time you walked in.\n- The design of the hotel SUCKED. You had to walk forever to get anywhere. \n-  Hotel room bathroom was horrible. Separate toilet room, but you could see through the glass, so it served NO purpose, no counter space, the bath was inside the shower, the shower was slippery, and water pressure was weak sauce.\n- Had to stay in a single King bed room after repeatedly requesting two queens and even calling the night before we arrived, and they never sent us a promised rollaway bed on the first night.\n- Calling downstairs was impossible. Nobody answered half the time and when they did, we had to wait for up to 45 minutes.\n- Concierge closes at 9pm.\n- We waited around 45 minutes for our car to come back from the valet\n- They had a \""multimedia center\"" that had tons of different types of plugs (including USB), but was NOT iPod compatible. When we called the concierge, they blamed Apple and conveniently suggested that we purchase a special plug from their technology store downstairs. When we were transferred to the store, the clerk couldn't tell us how much it cost and hung up on us.\n- The self-parking lot was the biggest waste of space ever.\n- The whole place just felt half-assed and cheap. It didn't have the feel of a hotel like the Wynn, Encore, Palazzo, or Bellagio.\n\nBottom Line:\nEven after a significant discount, I would have rather stayed at almost ANY other hotel. It was very disappointing."
0,"Don't expect a whole lot while construction is going on. Musky rooms, AC didn't work in our room, couldn't cover up at night without sweating. Front desk was NO HELP! Came here on our honeymoon and as a Vegas first timer-I'm not so sure we'll ever come back, and if we do we won't step foot in this hotel! Spend a little more and go elsewhere, heck spend a little less and get a nicer room somewhere else! Don't count on housekeeping here either-our room wasn't cleaned for 2 days! We even called and told them several times and still didn't have anyone come clean! Not to mention every morning we've been here they've been tinting windows at 7:30! Ridiculous! I read good reviews and was very excited to stay here but I've never been so dissatisfied.\n\nUpdate: We finally spoke to the \""right\"" person about our troubles and he had us moved to a different room. Only problem is the room (though slightly larger with a slightly better view and no more musky smell) had a horribly stained bath/shower and... Was 78 degrees when it was set on 60, just kept blowing hot air! We thought it might be the hotel so we gave it about 30 minutes before calling back. We were again moved, this time to a room they told us is called an \""island suite\"" just down the hall from our 2nd room. View isn't great, but the AC works! There's no tub, which is slightly disappointing, but with 1 night left it doesn't really matter. Even with the upgraded room, the experience was still unpleasant. I guess it's comforting to know they will put a small effort in to keeping guests comfortable after they complain.\n\nOh and don't bother with Savmore Car Rental-we had a coupon for 20% off (that came from the Tropicana coupon booklet!) and were told we can't use it. $250 for a small chevy cobalt for 3 days with 150 miles/day limit, would have been cheaper to taxi where we needed to go.\n\nI will say the bell boy that came to help us move to our second room was very pleasant, I didn't catch his name though. Also, the 2nd time we had to move, after waiting 20 minutes for the new keys, we received a call asking if we'd been given them yet and had a chance to view the new room. That was nice, the keys arrived shortly after the call.\n\nCheck out update:We were given $40 to use at Nikki Cafe when we checked out and our resort fee was removed. Though the experience started pretty bad and it took a few days to get it right, they did try to repair the damages once we complained a few times."
1,"Opulent is defined as luxurious or ostentatiously magnificent and I can think of no better single word to describe Joel Robuchon.  From you moment you first step into foyer, you know this meal is going to be ridiculous.  Even all seating, walls, and decorations are in diffuse shades of purple, the majestic royal color.  Most of the starred michelin restaurants are french restaurants with not-too-dissimilar sounding menus, so you may as well go all the way to the sole 3-star restaurant because it's worth the trip.\n\nWe did not do the 16-course degustation menu (I have a reason to come back...).  Instead we opted for the \""pick 2 main courses option\"" and all the extra courses surrounding that.  Here's what I got:\n\n1.  First off, the bread cart comes around and there are literally probably 25-30 different kinds of bread on it.  You can pick as many as you want, all fresh and wonderful.  They take your selections away to heat them, and bring them back promptly.  I went with the milk bread, bacon bread, and rosemary ciabatta.\n\n2. The amuse bouche was osetra caviar layered on top of a crab gelee with fennel cream.  Probably the most ridiculous amuse bouche I've ever heard of.\n\n3.  Appetizer: King Crab in Avocado on Romaine Heart, with olive oil.\n\n4.  Soup: Chestnut cream soup over chestnuts, foie gras, with bacon foam.  (Read that again... BACON FOAM!)\n\n5.  Main Course #1: Duck Breast with seared foie gras.  This is easily the finest cut of duck breast I've ever had, and perfectly prepared.  Duck is so hard to get right, and even in NYC there are only 2 places where I really like it (Porterhouse and La Sirene), and this blew both of those out of the water.  Succulent, tender, flavorful.\n\n6.  Main Course #2: Kobe Ribeye with wasabi spinach and malibu bell peppers.  Also, they served it up with a side of Robuchon's specialty whipped creamy potatoes.  They're like mashed potatoes, but your grandma never made mashed potatoes this creamy before.  I wonder if he patented some special machine to do this.\n\n7.  Then the cheese cart comes out, and it is as full of choices as the bread cart was.  Remember, everything here is about luxury and extravagance, so you can take as many different cheeses as you want to try!  I posted a photo of it if you want to see what it looks like.\n\n8.  Dessert: Pineapple Compote with Peanut ice cream.  What a unique flavor combination, but it worked really well.  The ice cream was as thick and creamy as you'd expect it to be.\n\n9.  The crowning end to the night is the cart of Mignardises.  There are numerous pictures posted of this, and you pretty much have to see it to believe it.  If I thought the bread and cheese carts were awesome, then this set of sweets is absolutely incredible.  Save room because you don't want to miss this part of the evening!"
1,"Prices are decent, they don't try to upsell you on every little thing. I've had a living social deal and a groupon here so far and services have been up to par on both. I upgraded to a full exterior detail last year as the car was due for a wax and they did a great job. Last time I was here they found my Armani sunglasses I thought I'd lost and made sure to tell me. I thought that was pretty nice of them since they could have easily just swiped them."
0,"Remind me why I revisited this place again after many years?\n\nOh yeah! It must be so that I can briefly say, \""Meh. I've experienced better\"""
0,"I'll just put it upfront.  Given all the hype about Hakkasan and how it was going to be the Vegas club to shut down all other Vegas clubs (you can Google the story about the bitter rich guy that got shut down for a table and vowed to destroy everyone else), Hakkasan just doesn't meet the hype.\n\nGetting in itself is a pain in the ass for a multitude of reasons.  First off, Hakkasan's in that \""we're the new hot new club, let's gouge everyone to death\"" cover mode.  $100 for guys on a big weekend is borderline obscene.  But hey, they know can get away with it with suckers like me, so until some other new badass club comes around, that's just how it's going to be.  Second, if you don't actually have a ticket beforehand, good luck getting in.  Third, even you have your ticket or your name on a guest list, have fun with that wait.  Luckily for me, I have all angles covered so this usually isn't a problem for me.\n\nOnce you're in, layout is fairly simplistic.  Third floor is the hip-hop floor.  Fourth floor is the main/EDM floor.  Fifth floor is just a balcony floor overlooking the main floor.  The outside area is located...oh wait, there's no outside area here?  You spent $200 million on the alleged \""best\"" club in Las Vegas and you don't even have an outside area?  What kinda fail is this?\n\nAnd this leads to the biggest issue of Hakkasan: it's just way overcrowded.  Obviously they need to make their money back because they spent a ridiculous amount to build the place, then an even more obscene amount to get the top DJs to establish residency.  But that's the problem, Hakkasan was clearly built to cater to those that get a table.  You look around the entire dance floor, it's filled up with tables.  You look at the fifth floor, the best (and realistically, only) views of the stage are if you have a table.  \n\nFor us mere mortals that go there every other week and aren't hood rich, you can't even move.  Being on the dance floor for Hardwell, I swear the most valuable commodity available is space.  Can't even really call it dancing at that point, it's just straight up being packed like sardines and MAYBE move around listlessly if you're lucky.  No wonder all these people are getting their phones and wallets jacked, you're pretty much a sitting duck.  Don't even get me start with the fact that the stairs leading down to the dance floor are just a hot mess once the main event act shows up.\n\nFor my beating house music heart, the only reason I'd ever come here is because Ti\u00ebsto, Hardwell, or Calvin Harris is playing.  I suppose the good thing about residency is that you know they're going to play here regularly, but heyyyy the costs get passed down to us.  And seriously, the light wall holds no candle to Marquee or Light, if you can even call it a light wall.\n\nI'm not gonna declare that I'd never come here again because I'm too much of a fanboy for Hardwell and Calvin Harris.  But I'd much rather go to Marquee, XS, or Light, unless someone I really have to see is playing.  All the other stuff isn't worth the crap I have to go through for the entire night to see one of my favorite artists playing."
0,"The overall spa experience was excellent.  The facilities were standard from what I've experienced from other high-end spas.  However, I had an extremely disturbing experience from their greeter, Trudy.  She needs to be retrained on customer service skills especially for an establishment that boasts a high-end clientele."
1,The Forum Shops at Caesars! Yay! It is so wonderful! These are shops that I thought I would never have seen unless I went to New York or Las Angeles but they have them here in Vegas! The prices for this very high end mall are steep but the awe of being in such a mall with all these stores and labels under one roof is amazing! For those of you who want more moderate prices there is still the strip that awaits you and the Fashion Place Mall which is nestled in between the hotels on the strip. There is also a very impressive mall in downtown Las Vegas too! But you gotta say there is nothing else like walking into a Versache store!
0,"What a freak show.  Waited for a pizza order and watched the counter guy getting his neck and cheeks rubbed by another guy who was wearing a grey coat and was obviously not working there at the time.  Another employee start laughing and a fight broke out behind the counter.  They carried the guy in the grey coat out the door and he was swearing up a storm.  The guy he punched eventually waited on me.  I don't know who owns this place but they need to know what happened and what a bunch of misfits are working there.  Great food.  Creepy employees.  Keep the recipe, get new help.  Others witnessed this crap.  Happened on Thursday around 7:30 pm.  Never again."
0,"Meh. Two stars for arriving on time, initial friendliness, and speedy job. Minus 3 stars for the lack of bothering to screw the vents back in thoroughly, the hard upsell, and the short temperament after I declined more services. Yes, there is more dust beyond the reach of your vacuum (which is why I hired someone to clean them in the first place). Yes, I know the dryer vent is dirty... And the groupon says for an extra fee, you will unclog it, but apparently not because the vent exits the house on the roof. Sigh... Like so many dryer vents! \n\nLol. Had I paid more, I wouldn't be LOLing, but he told me my house was probably 30 years old (not even since it was built in 1995) and had never ever had the AC filter changed. It was not even as dirty as the filter in my apartment gets in a month. He vacuumed out my vents at least from a strong van mounted system. Idk what more I expected for the price of the Groupon... But I'll pass on that next time."
0,"Don't waste your money on establishments that hire people with no respect for its customers.\n\nWhile the decor is nice the security personnel is rude and unprofessional. I was there Saturday with friends, we got hand stamps but when we left for the restroom, they made us stand in line to get back in and was quite rude and disrespectful. They were picking and choosing who to let in - which were all scantly clad women and their friends.\n\nI have sent letters to the Light Group about the Security staff behavior and treatment. Hopefully they will fire them all or send them to training classes."
0,"This should be a 2 1/2 stars. Wish I could give it more.The pasties are good but not traditional. I found them a little over-spiced but the pastry was rich and flaky. Wish they offered a plain meat, chicken and pork gravy as the reductions and sauces just aren't complimentary to all flavors of pasties and pies. Husband got a chix pot pie, gravy tasted like there was vinegar in it although it was supposed to be \""thyme chix gravy\"". He has an ulcer and it made him feel ill. In all fairness, I would eat there again as I feel they deserve another try. Service is excellent. Friendly, helpful and fast. For this alone, give them a try."
1,"Bollywood Bites is one of my favorite kind of restaurants, limited menu, but what they serve is delicious.  It's tucked away in a very nondescript building, there is no accidentally finding it, you have to be on a mission.\n\nHalf of their menu is street food, little bites of hot, flavorful goodies. The other half are curries, lentils, breads and rice dishes.  You can order lots of food because it is so inexpensive, I ordered, rice, bread, a chick pea patty appetizer and a lentil dish to the tune of $15.  It makes me want to dance like a Bollywood movie, big smiles with dramatic hand gestures.  \n\nTo get there turn on the road at Arby's on Polk Street (South Blvd near Pineville) go to the end of the road, turn left and it's on the end.  Driving up today, I thought it was closed, then I saw the magical OPEN sign! \n\nThere are a couple of picnic tables or you can take it to the food court at the mall.  Well worth the journey!"
1,"Have been here a couple times once with a large family group, and once just two of us. Both times the experience has been very pleasant. Both times we ate outside,  the atmosphere was relaxed, and the wait staff was great. The food was also very good-- a good tight menu with a broad selection (something for everyone) that wasn't too overwhelming (each dish seems to have been well thought out). I think everyone really enjoyed themselves."
1,"I ended up staying at the Palazzo completely by random, using Expedia's option where you can select a \""5 Star hotel,\"" general strip location, and it reveals the hotel name once it's paid for. \n\nThis method felt like a gamble, but hey, this IS Vegas! \n\nAs it turns out, I saved about $50 a night vs. booking it \""known\"" through the same travel site. And either way, I was more than satisfied with The Palazzo. \n\nI've spent a fair bit of time in Vegas, having worked there for a while. I've tried many of the higher end hotels (and some dogs), but after this stay, I will definitely repeat. \n\nMy room had a great view, overlooking the pool, the strip, and TI. \n\nThe suite was plenty spacious -- the sunken living room a nice touch. \n\nHigh end accompaniments, including the office space with all-in-one printer were welcomed. \n\n3 TV's in the room, including one facing the large soaker tub, keep you well entertained during any Vegas \""down time.\"" \n\nOverall, everything felt new, clean, and elegantly designed. \n\nLoved the pool area as well -- multiple pools, including topless. Sigh."
0,"I was at an event where they brought in Sprinkles cupcakes. So I can't write about the experience of going into the store. But I do know a good cupcake when I taste one and the one I had was not good. It was a chocolate cake and I think a white frosting with chocolate sprinkles. The cake was very dry. So much so that it was difficult to eat because it crumbled every time I took a bite. Also the frosting left a funny aftertaste in my mouth. I know it's possible that it was just an off batch, but for my cupcake fix I'll continue to support the local Scottsdale Bakery and Cupcake Company for now."
0,"Way to geared towards families. Try and go for a nice dinner with your date and they sit you beside a table of 10 screaming kids. The food is okay. Typical franchise type food. Nothing local. Nothing fresh. Terrible place to watch hockey. They don't play the game with sound considering how big and amazing the bar is, I find that pretty stupid. The waiters are usually great. The hostesses are terrible. Zero customer service from them. Its more about a fashion show and talking with their friends than caring about people coming in. I rather go to Boston pizza than jacks."
0,"the burgers were adequate. i'm undecided about this place since i just moved here. as far as impressions go, and our take-out order......wow........um........my girlfriend must have had the smallest salad in the world in her to go box. come on, for $8.50 you need more than something that couldn't fill up a rabbit........not going back. there ar ebetter deals in town."
1,So many cool things to see. it definately takes more than 2 days to see everything. 2008 was the first year i've attended and i could see why people would go ever year. there is so much to see and play with. \n\njust make sure to wear comfy shoes.. i was in heels and my feet were hurtinggggggggg...
0,"Good stuff first - The room was amazing! I want to give it 5 stars just for the room. My husband and I stayed here the night of our wedding and we loved the panoramic windows, soaking tub, and rainfall shower. The hotel also left us a nice fruit and cheese tray in our room for when we arrived. \n\nNot so great items - While we were waiting to check in and I was still in my wedding gown with our luggage in hand we had trouble at the front desk because my father was the one who booked it for us and the clerk was explain to us how he should be with us because it was his card.... Really I'm standing in my large wedding gown on my wedding night and you want to explain to us that there is difficult letting us have a key because the cards under my dad's name even though the room is under mine. That was finally settled after about 15 minutes. Then we ordered breakfast in the morning which detailed an order of 1 pancake and coffee with a side of sausage. They handed us a bill for $60! Afterwards when we left we had to pay for parking so we did so on our card and they still billed my father $25-30 for parking anyway. I had to go back and forth with the manager to get the charge reversed finally. \n\nWould I stay again- Sure because it'll be on my card but I would make sure to go out to eat."
1,I love.this place it bring back.to my childhood back east I would have never thought I would find a family run place with a great bread n pastries I can't wait to go back
1,"I am equaly surprised at a 2 star review.  I am fairly new to the Phoenix area and was introduced to the store by a friend.  I cannot begin to tell you how great this store is.  The service I have received here is outstanding!  No question!  I had a special holiday dinner and needed a product customized.  The staff went out of their way to \""get it right\"" for me.  Not only once!  Their prices are unbeatable.  I can gratefully overlook any minor inconveniences, I just do it another way.  It is a little out of my way to go there, but I go as much as I can.  Keep up the great work."
0,"The music, and only the music, saved this bar from a one star rating. A country bar shouldn't be trendy, it shouldn't have a 15 minute line out the front, it shouldn't be easy to spot idiots in RVCA gear, and it DAMN sure shouldn't cost more than $10 for a Jim Beam on the rocks. \n\nThis place sucks. Go somewhere else."
0,Fancy and mexican restaurant should never be in a statement together. Save yourself a few bucks and go to Zapata's instead. The food leaves you wanting more in seasoning and wondering why you spent so much for a subpar plate.
0,"I give this place two stars because I reserve one star reviews for absolute shit places. So, I guess you could say this place is just a step above shit. I ordered sweet and sour pork for 17.99 and it was the worst I'd ever had. If you had placed that dish in front of me and asked me to guess how much it cost, I would've guessed maybe 2.99, but no, it was close to 20 bucks. It was advertised as \""crispy pork\"" with a sweet and sour glaze but the dish I was served was soggy, and was clearly not cooked on site. My guess is that it was probably microwaved or perhaps had been sitting out for a while. The waitstaff was neither personable nor warm. Our waiter took his time with refilling our waters, and we had to ask for pretty much all our silverware. Do NOT eat here!! The staff clearly does not care about you, your dining experience, or the fact that you are paying triple the price for the quality of food you're receiving. You're better off eating at Burgr!"
0,"First off, I want to say, I loved the concept.\nThe detailing in our experience was really something else.\n\nThat being said, the food itself was just OK, considering it was a bowl of ramen for fifteen bucks. Seriously. I could have gotten the same thing at GaNaDaRa in the West End for a fraction of the price.\n\nAs for the service, while I agree that they do try their best, I'm pretty sure they switched our waitress halfway through because the first one we had didn't speak English.  This was a bit strange, since as a result we waited around to order for some time. They also placed us (a couple on a date) at the bar, nearly a meter away from each other, which made for holding hands at the table quite awkward.\n\nI'd maybe suggest just going to this place as a late-night joint? As a dinner date venue, it was something of a let-down."
0,"Let me preface this by saying that I have eaten at SEVERAL of the Grand Cafes in the Stations Chains (the worst by far to this point has been the one at Red Rock) over the years. I used to eat in them back when they existed the first time, then when they became Denny's and Coco's, and again when they were brought back again as Grand Cafes. I have to say that with the exception of Kim, Wayne, Charles and Joey on the Graveyard Shift (and they are the reason I raised the overall to 2 stars instead of 1 or 0 stars), I have pretty much had nothing but horrible experiences at the one at the Santa Fe Station.\n\nThe most recent issues have occured over the last 2 days (12-29 and 12-30-12). For starters, they have decided that you can only have one slice of toast (cut in half to \""2\"" pieces of toast) on your breakfast meals. Then, NONE of their cooks apparently have learned how to cook an egg over-easy. Next, when you ask for a side of toast (again only one slice cut into halves), it is $2.99 for that one slice of bread. Then, on their menu it says you can substitute soup or salad, however when you try to order the soup over night, they tell you that they no longer serve soup at night.\n\nI am sure that Stations people won't see this, but I do have to say that if you go to these cafes, you have a better time than I have the last few times. I hate to say it, but I think I am going to have to start going back to Denny's for my early morning breakfasts."
1,It was a great experience and what an excellent job Nick has done! Nick is very professional and he knows exactly what you want. It took about an hour and he shot about 100 pics for me in different angles and poses. It was a professional studio with all the necessary equipments including lights and backgrounds. Five stars and good job Nick!
1,"Best fast food nachos... I enjoy the pork or their ground beef. They have a lot of salsa choices, black beans and refried beans... their queso beats out other comparable places like Qdoba (chipotle has chips but doesnt serve nachos, go figure). The staff is friendly and there usually it not a wait. Good value for the money."
0,I ordered the country fried steak and it tasted artificial. The service was awful coffee tasted old and watery and it took forever to take our order and for them to bring our good. My boyfriend ordered the omelette fried rice it was okay. We also got the red velvet pancakes and the lemon ricotta pancakes they were good... the only thing good about this place were the pancakes.
1,"Poutine is great. Definitely try the Reuben sandwich it's a treat. However, the Carrot Cake is the BEST I've ever had. It is truly amazing!!!"
0,First time here and ordered wings. I usually don't like mine hot (spicy) but when I got them they were cold. Warm in the middle and cold tips. The flavor was good and I could eat them fast but having parts of it half frozen was a big turn off. The waitress was pretty fast at taking our order and delivering our drinks.
1,"love the decor. \n\nrooms were nice. very modern. loved that the curtains opened when i entered the room! but, a bit too high tech cause i couldnt figure out how to turn on the lights. \n\nthe bathroom was nice, but the water pressure in the shower was only okay. i do have to say that the echo in the bathroom is a bit trippy. \n\nwould i stay again? yes."
1,"Many wonderful flavors,  a lot of toppings and a clean place :) idk how much for an ounce,  but I paid under five dollars. Get what you want and go on a stroll down town and call it a night :)"
1,"Was definitely very pricey for what you get. I ordered a combo with ribs, chicken, and brisket with side of mac n cheese and collard greens. However my brisket was pretty dry which i wasnt happy about. I had to drench it with the different bbq sauces they had. \n\nThe chicken was good and moist. That was well cooked. And what is a bbq place if i dont get ribs. The ribs were good but it wasnt like i never ate ribs like this before. \n\nThe atmosphere was nice they had a lot of TVs there.\n\nThe one thing i would suggests is that to get the sweet tea! Now that was really great!\n\nI just wish my brisket was better because thats one of my favorite types of bbq. \n\nthis place was referred by a person who worked at the charlette bobcats arena, so I figure i give it a shot."
0,Awful and over priced!  Water spilled all over me and my new coach purse and snobby staff all expect for our waiter. Hated everything about it. I knew we should of went to the BBQ place across the street.
1,Sooooo much fun! I played with my mom and dad.... The staff...NOT so friendly... One of them seemed annoyed because my parents were asking her HOW they really played BINGO...BOOOOO. But for $15 for an hour's play... it was our money's worth. I find that playing on paper has more thrill than playing electronically.
1,Pretty legit steakhouse. Needs an extended happy hour.
0,"I can honesty say this is THE worst hotel I have ever stayed in. If you are looking for a good Vegas experience, this is not your place.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in the front door, I was terrified. The overwhelming putrid smell and the VERY VERY dated decor was enough to almost make me turn around immediately but I continued hoping the hotel room itself would be a lot better... I was wrong. The smell lingered through the halls and into the room. Outfitted with terrible wallpaper and disgusting carpet, a 1990s air/heat box, dated furniture and NASTY linens/blankets- this place resembled a motel 6 and an extremely low budget casino from a small town- which I would almost prefer over this.\n\nThe staff was unfriendly and unhelpful- asking for towels seemed to be too much for them to handle. My friends luggage was lost on the way in and once it was delivered to the hotel, they called and told her she would have to come get it because they didn't have time for at least an hour.\n\nI can not clearly put into words how low budget and disgusting the entire experience was... Even the restaurants within were terrible. We ate at a Big Dicks one afternoon for a quick lunch before venturing out onto the strip and had the WORST food that was WAY overpriced and took over 2.5 hours from start to finish.... Low budget dairy queen and a kids arcade--- enough said."
1,"Service was as excellent as it could get. Ahi Katsu special was as good as it sounds. My daughter had the kalbi ribs that they cooked to her preference and even cut into little pieces which saved me about 20 mins. The  Mac salad has potatoes in it, nice touch. The fries were salty but delicious. Definitely headed back to try the garlic shrimp."
1,"The BEST dining experience we have ever had. My husband and I were in Vegas in September for his birthday. I called in advance( recommend) to make a reservation. \nWe eat out a lot and always say we need to start blogging about where we eat and the experience. To tell you the truth our taste buds have been bored until we got to Gordon's steakhouse. When you walk in the door (tunnel) you immediately get a warm welcome. We waited in the full service bar until our table was ready. The wait staff was very kind, happy, busy and many people were eating at the bar. We had a glass of wine and shortly after went to be seated. The restaurant is beautiful. Our waiter was fabulous, and attentive. I loved the palate of cuts of meat and very descriptive discussion of each. I loved that i could see the kitchen hard at work. They made sure each person at the table received their plate at the same time, two, four or six people! The plate was placed down and our waiter began his description of each dish. We had mouth watering filet's, creamed spinach, mac and cheese to die for. Oh and a plate of bread, small samples of many kinds, which i never got passed the bacon bread it was so delicious. Our bellies (full of course ) we would try the sticky toffee pudding ( house favorite) and you will know why when you try it.  It is so worth the money because we can not stop talking to our friends about it. A must in Vegas. Hope he opens one in Houston. Enjoy"
0,"This buffet is a joke. Monday brunch -June 17th,2013.....very limited seafood.. No crabs... I asked the chef, he said only dinner time or weekends. Left 20% tip... Unfortunately you pay before you get in and nobody nobody took our drink order for an hour...end of our brunch....3-4 empty plates each sitting on our table and nobody cleaned up the table , nobody!! .. We sat there an hour an a half. No waiting staff.... Food is mediocre ...cheap and repetitive... \n\nDo yourself a favor and go to Bellagio. Even Flamingos buffet has mountain of sea food and crab legs.... Really!"
0,"I like steakhouse part of it.. And how you can get sashimi without the rice but I'm more of a roll eater and let me tell you... It's not the best. Or even close. We came in a party of 6 and it was not busy AT ALL. Asked for half of us doing all you can eat and the other half doing the teppanyaki.. She looks around like its a hassle.. Did I mention it was NOT BUSY and says yes can you wait 5 minutes while I set up the table. Sure. 10 min past and there's 2 girls counting money at the register. I stand up and inquire about our table and yeah finally the same waitress comes around and grabs some menus and then begins to set up our table which only took 1 min because of its simplicity. Okay now the teppanyaki man who came out to clean the dirty grill used dirty wet towels.. Ok. The imitation crab was fishy, the soft shell crab was fishy, the Kama which was cooked was also fishy and our waitress only came back twice to ask if we needed anything else... We got all you can eat so obviously we needed something else later and we never saw her again. Oh and did I mention it wasn't busy?"
1,"Best wings in town, in my opinion. I always stick with original hot. Their atomic flavor tastes like some weird peppered beef jerky. That's disappointing to someone like myself who loves spicy food. But overall, I've never had a bad encounter as far as the food or employees go. It's always been a grand experience."
1,"Well my girlfriend and I came here for dinner one night because she had told me that this place was amazing for the price. I have never been to a Korean BBQ place before, and from what I heard from the girlfriend and many of my asian friends, this place was the place to be at.\n\nWhen we walked in, it was fairly quiet. Many other patrons were quietly eating their food. It looked like Honey Pig was airing out the restaurant by opening all the doors and windows, and having the vents on full power. Honestly it sounded like a factory or something haha. No biggie though, I'm there for the nitrosamine foods, not the noise.\n\nMy girlfriend and I got the AYCE, which included several different meats. In my opinion, everything tasted great, but I especially enjoyed the bulgogi and the Sirloin. The Ribs were delicious as well! There was squid included, but honestly I don't like the texture of squid. My girlfriend said it was good though, so there's my review on that haha.\n\nI was very impressed with the attentiveness of our waitress. She came by often to help us grill and also bring more meat out. Although there were times where she looked like she had too many people to manage, she never forgot any request that we had.\n\nThat cinnamon drink at the end tho!!! I think I wanted to take a gallon home! Haha! Overall this place was great for the price. Would I come back? Yeah probably... I hear there are many great Korean BBQ places in Vegas so maybe I'll check all of them out also."

0,"Food is okay, but WORSE SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! The management sucks, as well as the servers. Also the place is veryyyy dirty. I would not eat there!!!!!!!"
1,"I love this place.  The owners don't speak or understand english but their kids do.  They are a great little family doing their thing.  Great food prepared fast with large orders. I eat here often, and would eat here everyday if I could.  Alot of the larger restaurants could learn alot from this little gem.  \n\ngreat food.  The fried rice here is the goods. \n\nWiFi is free as there is a startbucks next door."
0,"Service... OMG. Find the owner... Slap some sense in them. I cannot believe how oblivious some people are that let's them think they have the right to be an owner. We seriously asked for water... 3 times! Our food was delivered and there was no silverware. We asked for silverware... 3 times! All while our quirky little waitress chatted it up with the bartender. \n\nIf you have but one day to live because the world is ending, and Desert Babe's is the last place to get food on the planet, shoot yourself in the head and save yourself true misery."
1,"Pleasantly surprised at this little gem.  I had the curry tofu and my partner had the orange tofu... we finally stepped outside our box. (I usually will order something like the moo goo gai pan at restaurants like this)\n\nWe are glad we stepped out of the box because it was excellent.  The orange tofu had an excellent glaze and still kept it's nice softness on the inside.  Same with the curry. The curry was nice and spicy, just like it's supposed to be and doesn't kill you with the spice.\n\nWe didn't have an issue with the rice like other reviewers did... not special, but not bad either.\n\nThe staff were real nice.\n\nThere was a steady flow of people moving in and out of the place, even at 1pm.\n\nIt was quick, easy, cheap and tasty.  Definitely worth it."
1,"After a hike to Mt. Charleston and friend and I decided to try Burger Dogs. The location has been many things in the past and I asked my friend if they had visited the establishment since it looks like it just opened and was right around the corner from his house. He had not and since I like to support local businesses so we decided to try it out. Not knowing anything about it other than the name. I thought it was going to be burgers in the shape of hotdogs, but sadly it wasn't (possible new menu item). They serve hamburgers and hotdogs. It was $3.85 for a singer patty burger without cheese. They have varieties up to four patties for the super hungry and don't charge for their toppings. The toppings are what you would most likely serve at a backyard barbeque spread: mayo, mustard, tomato, onion, lettuce, pickle, and grilled onions. We ordered two burgers with everything but mayo and a side of fries. The burgers are a good hearty size and I bonus points for grilling the bun. It did take a tad long in the drive-up but I feel that is expected since it looks like everything was made to order. The fries were crisp but a little over salted and I wish that they used that extra salt to season the burger but those are my only gripes. I will probably go back and at some time try the shakes that boast they are made from real ice cream. A good burger at a good price at a local business, worth the trip."
0,"Horrible service. We arrived and were told there was a 30 minute wait, or we could sit and eat at the bar. We were happy to sit at the bar, which was not crowded. The bartender did acknowledge us, but never asked us if we wanted a drink or a food menu. He waited on a few people, never again looking our way. About 10 minutes go by and he walked over to a few girls at the bar and started flirting with them. We got up and left. Bartender never noticed. Would not go back."
0,Just ok.
0,There was a  cockroach crawling inside the glass where the candy and shell are.   French vanilla was stale and just nasty.   Do not know if this is locally owned or not but they need to do something.  Bad all around
0,Boy what a huge disappointment. Fried rice and 'scallops' that had a pink color..... Not kidding. What makes fried rice pink? And tasteless. I would never consider returning to this place. Soup was muchroom flavored broth. Salad would've been OK if it wasn't for the large inedible chunks of lettuce 'core'. I was VERY unhappy leaving here. Never again. Scallops were irregular 'pink' pieces that had no taste and were not cooked correctly. NEVER again.
1,"Every other Saturday, everything is 50% off! I always find great kids clothes here. Today, I got a pair of barely worn tap shoes, a barely worn pink kids leotard, some pink pants and a lovely black market white house blouse with the dry cleaning tag still on - all for $5.50!!!\n\nNow, here's the catch - the line during the crazy saturday sale is llloooonnnnggggg! How long??? Down the hall and into the next room long. How how loonnng? 35 minutes in line long. But if you go with some friends and have fun with it - it's worth the bucks saved!"
0,"Disgusting! Just found a spider in my quesadilla, I called and complained and was treated like i was lying. I was told to bring the food back because the cook stated that it couldnt be possible. my goal was to take it back no matter what a get a refund! Not very professional to tell the consumer they are lying!"
1,"First time joining a crossfit gym and I haven't regretted it.  Every work out is a challenge.  I feel myself advancing my strength, endurance, speed, agility, and overall body coordination. \nI was an avid gym goer and runner looking for something to break up my normal routine for the summer.  I had been looking for a crossfit gym for a while but never really found one that I clicked with.  The owners here are amazing.  They are attentive, informative, intelligent, personable, and funny.  They have been doing crossfit for years so I feel like I have a couple of professional  personal trainers.  Each work out is catered to each of their students needs, no one gets left out.  \nBlack Storm in reasonably priced and brand new.  All equipment is new.  Everything in the gym is new.  And they have a coupon on here!  Better use that up.   \nIf you enjoy being average then stay at home on your computer reading yelp reviews, but if you want to make a step in the right direction and set your self apart form the normal,  you better make your way to Crossfit Black \nStorm."

1,"One of my girlfriends invited us out to this place with the promise of everything tasting awesome on a Friday night.  It's located in a small shipping center and if you're driving by, you would miss it!\n\nWe had to wait for a little bit, probably 20 minutes, but this place is small and it was 6:30 on a Friday night.  While we were waiting, the kitchen gave us free garlic knots.  \n\nOnce seated, we were seen by our waitress immediately for drinks and appetizers.  We ordered the fried ravioli, cheesy garlic bread, and  calamari. Everything was good, but the fried ravioli was the best I've ever had!  It had plenty of filling and just enough crisp.\n\nFor dinner I ordered Bobos baked spaghetti and Sean ordered lasagna. It was all very tangy and delicious! If you hate garlic, maybe you won't like it so much but we do and we loved it! It was even better the next day.\n\nWe'll definitely be back for date night!  It's family friendly and has a nice dark atmosphere."
1,"One of my favorite stops!!! The atmosphere is awesome!!! The food is amazing!! We always get the coconut shrimp spring rolls, and the spicy edamame. Very good. And I usually choose from any of the fish. I like that you can pick what you want and how you want it cooked etc. The burgers are amazing if you don't like fish and so is the salads!!"
1,"Your average Wetherspoons, not the greatest restaurant but reasonable food, good beer and spirits, beware of using the car park  I had to get a pass from the bar, you could soon get a parking ticket."
1,"What a great place. It's a little overwhelming when you first walk in, trying to figure out what's going on and what you're supposed to be doing...is it a market, a bar, a coffee shop, a deli?  All of the above.  I was greeted at the door and got a quick explanation about how it all worked.  The Spicy Turkey sandwich was delicious and the guys behind the counter were perfect.  I wanted a local beer and they pointed me in the right direction (it was soo good), and broke down a six pack for my single brew.  Just...great.  Wish I had this place down the street from my house."
1,"I first ate at Roys a few years back in Honolulu... So I was pretty excited to have one here in PHX, when my job brought me to the valley. Good seafood in the valley.. Yay! \nSuperb service... ask away, the waiters never seem to lose patience or get snippy.. they know the product and the wines.. \nThere isnt a thing on the menu that I dont like.. I havent tried everything.. but whenever friends from out of town come in.. This is one of my first suggestions.. My fav is the butterfish.. and the pineapple dessert.. all the other things are wonderful ... In other words... your not gonna go wrong here. Hey its Roy Yamaguchi..  for Gods sake.. and he can fuse and cook like no other.."
0,"The staff is very rude. As soon as I find another place to fix my watches, I will go there. VERY disappointed."
0,"I was there with a friend a couple of weeks ago. I loved the open air patio and the inherent outstanding people watching but, I have to agree with others here,  most of the servers ignore the customers. We we sitting at the bar. The young male bartender said hi once, then never again even though he was walking back and forth in front of us the whole time. If it weren't for the server from the other side of the bar, we wouldn't have had service. We thought the food was too expensive but the beer selection was good and cold. We had a couple while watching the game but left to go eat as one of the many places surrounding this place."
0,Just walked out of this place after being seated and ignored for 15 minutes in a mostly empty restaurant.  3 servers walked past us and even after alerting the empty headed hostess of our plight another 5 minutes passed.  We gave up and have forever given up on this place.  Can't wait for Sushi Brokers to open their new location.  At least the service is\nalways good there.  Done with Stingray!
0,So slow!!! Been told that he placed my meds in a RUSH but I've been here for 30mins now and I'm still waiting. Again... SLOW!!!
0,Went to Bond bar and lounge and the bartender that looked like Pitbull wouldn't serve my cousin because he had an international ID. Wow I didn't know that TSA ran the cosmopolitan. This place discriminates go to Hyde instead.
0,"So i purchased a living social deal for this company. made and appointment for a move out clean, which the owner told me she could do right off the bat. I explained everything would be out of the house, they just needed to clean the floors, walls, bathrooms, and not to worry about the carpet because it was being replaced. the appointment was for Monday morning and the key would be in the mailbox so they could go in. Well, about 4pm that day, i got a call from my husband telling me they had never been there to clean. I started calling, i called all the way up till 9pm, every hour, then started again at 5:30 am every 30 min. I finally get a call back when i threatened small claims court and calling the Better Business Bureau. She yelled at me, told me they do not do the Living Social deals for deep cleaning. Deep cleaning? Everything is out of the house? So the \""crew\"" walked inside, looked through the entire house, decided not to clean it, even though i pre paid, and couldn't call me right then? Shes a liar, doesn't add. up. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Once they get your money, they wont call back. I suggest everyone who has had trouble call the BBB and get their accreditation taken away!"
0,"I have been here twice. \nThe first time I cut my hair, the service was nice, but they don't know how to cut layers, your hair just looks like cut with a pair of scissors from left to right...\nThe second time I curled my hair. To make it clear how I want it, I even made my hair with iron in the morning. But I have to say she gave it a good try, but nothing looks like what I want. Plus, it seems she was not familiar with the procedure at all that she read the direction when she made hair for me... \nI'm so disappointed..."
1,"We have purchased quite a bit of musical equipment and instruments from this location, and they always do a good job. Sometimes I feel a bit out of my league when employees start talking shop, but even still, they manage to help me get what I need.\n\nRecently purchased $99 in-ear headphones and it was a no-fuss deal. They have a decent selection of keyboards, low end to high end, and didn't sneer when I bought a less expensive model. \n\nGuys in the guitar department are great, and helped the Mr with a new bass guitar purchase. I prefer Sam Ash to the large competitor, and recommend it to friends looking to make a music-related purchase.\n\nOh, they also offer a music teacher discount, which I've used and has come in super handy, especially with expensive instruments."
1,Very good food and nice grounds.  Had BBQ. Bacon burger and it was a 10.  Onion rings and sweet potato fries good too.  Definitely will be back.
0,"We will not be back. From the moment we walked in it was absolute chaos. A waitress bumbed into my husband and did not apologize, a man was yelling (loudly) into a mic what food needed to be replaced and no one greeted us for at least five minutes (no one else was waiting). We literally said \""man this food better be good\"". It was not. The sushi was completely tasteless.  The dumplings were so hard fried they cut my mouth. The chicken was chewy. It was cheap-but cheap for a reason, just BAD.  Buffets like this are rarely great-but it is difficult I think to be this BAD. Honestly I would not go back if it was free."
1,"If you are looking for a down to earth, patient, understanding, knowledgeable, professional, passionate and fun golf instructor, Shane Crosley is the guy to see!\n\nI've had 4-5 lessons with Shane.  I'm now shooting in the 80s from the high 90s & 100s.  \n\nShane's approach to teaching is as simplistic or as technical as the student wants, he gives you as much information as you can handle, provides a short and long term plan for playing better and keeps it fun for the student. \n\nIf you want to play better golf, the easiest way is to call Shane!"
0,"I've eaten here a few times now.  If it weren't for my last experience I would have likely given it 3 or 4 stars.  Bottom line - the staff needs to get it together.  The food is pretty good, and to me, a bit better than what you would maybe expect from a fast food restaurant.  \n\nWhere they fall short is their customer service and wait staff efficiency.  Our last visit couldn't have gone much worse.  We get there and there are a few tables of 5 or 6 guests but definitely not a packed house.  We sit down and hear the table next to us complaining to their waitress about incorrect orders.  We look over to another table and they tell us the service has never been so bad.  This should have been our cue to leave....but we stayed, unfortunately.  Our waitress was nice but didn't know their menu and would forget to bring us things we asked for (straw, spoon, water).  We ordered my son an ice cream with Reese's cups but it came out with Butterfinger.  Not a huge deal but we let them know to hopefully prevent them from doing it again.  I then ordered an ice cream for my wife an I with Reese's cups.  What do you think they put in the ice cream?  Butterfinger!  Again, not a huge deal but get it together people!  It was then time to checkout.  This should be easy, right?  First they charged me for a kids meal that was supposed to be free that day.  She didn't have the ability to override the order so she had to call her manager (I assume) who was also the cook.  He came over and took care of it.  I then had her go over everything on the order to make sure everything else was right.  Found another mistake with one of the items.  She didn't believe me until I had her pull out a menu and showed her.  \n\nI wouldn't recommend going to this restaurant until they can prove they have what it takes to run a restaurant.  Right now they don't."
1,"Takes a long time to clean up table. But its understandable cos grill is hot n need cool down, i suppose. The price is really good but the meat, especially the short ribs are not tender. \nI would not be a regular here, just because the smell afterward in your clothes is horrific, we suppose plan go Hakasan  right after dinner. But once i get in the car, that BBQ smell is just a turn off. So word of advice is that make sure your next stop is shower lol.\n\nI wish there is a 3.5 start, because that is what it earned."
1,I recently bought a Nissan maxima from this dealership and had a couple Scratches that were visible on the door. I brought it to the attention of the salesman and he put it on the due bill to be fixed. I had scheduled my appt for a couple weeks later and debbie M and the manager LaRoyne Brown had helped set me up. When I arrived the initial appt was thought to be a couple hours so I figured they had wifi and I could hang there till it was done. When the paint guy was able to look at it we then found out that it would probably be an all day ( as the paint had to dry) LaRoyne then set up a rental car for me to use for the day ( free of charge)  I thought that was very kind and it was great to just have the dealership do the right thing. ;0)
0,"Can it get any worse. 5 tables on a Sunday. Wait time over 2 hours. Place is dirty, service is beyond bad and the food well I can't even remember. BEWARE"
1,If you're near Central & Thomas you MUST try this place!  I'm in love with their menu.  They have everything from burgers to delicious hot dogs.  \n\nYou can even get burritos in the morning. Yes... So good.\n\nService is always fast and quality if food is always up to par.  I'm loving the Mexican burger!  It had green chile and grilled onions... Man I'm hungry just writing about it.  Try everything!!!! Won't disappoint. ;)
0,Not very many nice restaurants at the terminal I was at. Slots are fun the whole place has that old casino staleness to it.  The car rental return is farther from the airport than the strip. So annoying to return your rental car and have to take a bus miles back to the airport.
0,"You must have at least 4 people in your group to have a table to yourself!  I used to have a lot of business meetings with clients at this place (at least twice a week) as it was right down the street from my office.  The food is not great and the service is unusually horrible but they have a big selection for my business clients to choose from as most have different tastes and it is more of a relaxing environment in which most like. One Sunday, 2 friends and I were having lunch at a table for four people.  They sat a stranger with us to have lunch....very awkward, but was okay as we were all drinking beers.  About two weeks later (on a Friday), I was entertaining potential clients discussing our company and answering other questions.  There were three of us sitting at a table for four people.  They had the \""balls\"" to sit another guy at our table as they say they were now sitting groups together to fill all spots.  I told the manager that we were discussing business as he seemed to not care and still sit the guy with us.  Needless to say, I have never returned to a zipps and never will."
1,"Had lunch here today for the first time after hearing so many great things  about it. The food is enormous but still delicious. I was worried that with being on TV (Man Versus Food, a personal fave of mine) that the food would be more of a gimmick and less of a diamond in the rough. Much to my party's delight, everything we ordered was tasty and well prepared. The neighborhood of Sunnyslope is a bit rough around the edges, but this is definitely a good find and a reason to visit.\n\nFor a business/work lunch, food was quick, service was polite and we ate a ridiculous amount of food. I can't wait to try a couple of the other amazing looking tortas!"
1,"I love indian food, and have been eating it for 20 years.   My favorite dish is Chicken Vindaloo, EXTRA SPICY.  Most places don't make it nearly hot enough, but Origin India cooked it perfectly.  I would have to say that this is the best indian food that I have ever eaten.  Amazing and reasonably priced too.  Highly recommend it!"
0,They have no idea how to do NFL Sunday football to cater to all NFL fans. They kept changing channels and half of there tv signs where games were suppose to be located did not match. Don't bother coming for a game unless your a Browns fans (no offense to the Browns fans). They need to take NFL Sunday customer service from other bars who have experience. The owner was a douche and lied about certain tv's being linked together just bc he was to much of an ass to change to the tv the sign stated in the 1st place....

1,We have been frequenting this store since it first opened.  As other reviews have commented Peg the owner supports local artists.  She is very knowledgeable and the stories behind some of the artisans and the pieces they make are very interesting.  We always manage to find some very unique pieces to give as gifts.

0,I have never been to any Benihana before. So Mom and Dad were in town and wanted to hit it. I guess they thought it was ethnic food (and wanted to try and please me). Uh.. not.. Been to Japan and didn't seem like I was in Japan at all.. lol.. \n\nThe show (throwing my food around and stuff) was okay but kinda weird. I ordered Prawns (Spicy) and steak. Was sort of weird as they cook the prawns.. throw em around.. cook up an onion.. set it on fire... then way later knock out my steak.. I ate.. onions.. shrimp.. them steak.. was like two meals.. kinda strange. I would rather they kept it in the kitchen under a heat light then served it all at once. Oh well.. \n\nSo the service as in drinks was low.. not Silverton (the bench mark of crappy service read my review if u don't know that place) but not very good. I would have enjoyed getting a few drinks but instead.. i got .. 1.. lol.. oh well.. \n\nFood was pretty tasteless and super boring but there was flames.. so its worth something if your a pyromaniac like me!
0,"I've been coming to Dr. Keller for the last 2 years or so. In all honesty, I've had decent experiences with her at times , but a specific series of events caused this review. \n\nThe first issue was that I reccommended that my mother go to her because she was so close. My mother went to her, and she suggested that she go to a surgeon for a hysterectomy due to some complicated issues. \n\nAfter the hysterectomy my mom wasn't doing well emotionally. She was miserable. I came into her bedroom one night because I heard her crying, at which point she said, \""I've never understood how someone could kill themselves, but I do now. I don't know what to do, I don't know why I feel this way.\"" \nTo hear her say that broke my heart.\n\nShe was under Dr. Keller's care after the surgery and Dr. Keller wrote it off and did nothing about it. She called Dr. Keller's office several times and saw her twice after the surgery. My mother insisted it had to be from the hysterectomy because she hadn't felt this way prior.  \n\nShe got progressively worse and with Dr. Keller ignoring her concerns, she went to another gynecologist. He prescribed her estrogen. It was like a lightbulb turned on and it all made sense. With the hysterectomy, her body wasn't getting the hormones she needed. The new Dr was completely shocked that Dr. Keller had overlooked this. The negligence was unbelievable. My mother already struggled with seasonal depression, so without the estrogen, she would have gotten worse, and would have likely killed herself eventually. Understandably, my mother hasn't been back since. \n \nThe second issue was that I had called and made an appointment for a mirena implant. The previous visit there I had mentioned it to Dr. Keller and she had adamantly suggested I do depo or Nuva Ring. I had already done depo with weight gain so I tried the Nuva Ring. I did not like it, it was uncomfortable, and didn't work out in the long run. (Not surprising since that's not what I requested but doctor's have a tendency to push their own agendas) She had told me before I had to be on my period to have the implant put in, so I called when I was.\n\nWhen I tried to make the appointment for the mirena I got one 3 weeks later on a Tuesday because they didn't have time that week and I explained what Dr. Keller had said about the cycle. She even put the phone down to go speak to Dr.Keller and check to make sure.\n\nSo three weeks later on Monday (day before) I called to check what time the appointment was. The woman on the phone was different and a nightmare. She insisted that I had no appointment, and even had I scheduled an appointment, it had to be a consult and not an insertion. I said that no one told me about the consult, but that I was quite sure I had an appointment as I specifically remembered speaking to the girl and told her the girl had even checked with Dr. Keller. The woman insisted that she was one of the only few girls that worked at the desk and that I had no appointment, refusing to speak to Dr. Keller about it. She was so focused on being right and proving me wrong that it didn't matter that I was a patient or that I was frustrated or on the brink of tears. \n\nShe curtly informed me that she had an appointment for a month later that I may have. I had already waited a month. So in the most even voice I could muster I said, \""no that's alright, I think I need to find another doctor.\"" To which she said, \""ok have a great day,\"" as if she hadn't just been the most insensitive human being known to man.\n\nAfter that, I called my mother. I've never had someone be so aggressively unkind in a doctor's office. My mother was incensed (due to her own experience) and called back. The girl proceeded to lie and tell her that I had screamed at her, and that in actuality, she had an appointment available that day, but because I was \""rude\"", she had withheld that information, but if I wanted to call back (aka grovel), she would schedule it for me.\n\nSo now we've gotten to the point that this woman, this front desk worker, has taken it upon herself to be the decider of my health care and appointments based on my behavior and cooperation via a phone conversation. She was now the official gyno gate keeper. Are you fucking kidding me?!?!?! Not to mention the fact that it was a bold faced lie. I have no problem screaming at someone, and no problem admitting it, but I did not scream at this woman. After hearing that however, my mother did scream at her. \n\nI haven't been back to the office since. Today they have the nerve to leave me a voicemail about my \""annual wellness exam\"" as if none of that ever happened. Well good thing, because it reminded me to write this review. So thanks guys! \n\nNo thank you on the appointment though. I'd rather wait a few months for a better doctor and avoid dealing with Cerberus. Word of advice, if you can't control your employees, you shouldn't have your own practice, and if you can't care for your patients properly, you shouldn't be a doctor."
0,"We found ourselves at Desert Ridge Saturday night, and my husband suggested we check out San Felipe.  He was a fan of the former DC Ranch location.\n\nNot too crowded for a Saturday night.  Ambiance was loud and annoying, but not unexpectedly so.  Not really the type of place to go if you want to hear yourself think.\n\nUpon looking at the menu, the first thing I noticed was that chips and guac was $9.  I don't think I've ever seen chips and guac for $9.  Sounded good but not that good.  Instead we got chips and salsa for $3.  The salsa portion was a small 2.5\"" ramekin or so.  Tiny portion. $3?!  Anyway, also noticed there were no prices on the drink menu.  That's annoying.\n\nSo our server approached and wanted to take a drink order.  I asked what was on tap.  And then my husband asked about a bucket of Modelo.  Our server, Lyndsey, got immediately confused/defensive.  Not sure why 2 simple questions would throw her off that way.  But, her exact responses, while irritating, are irrelevant.  It was the snippy, defensive attitude that kinda got me. \n\nHello.  If you don't put drink prices on the menu, a guest could quite possibly ask how much stuff is.  Not only did she not know what the exact prices were, her attitude was so off-putting--like the total opposite of someone who wants to provide good guest service and earn a tip.\n\nWe finally got through the drink order debacle and she took our order and I was already over it at that point.  We each ordered fish tacos and my son had fish and chips.  The fish tacos were generously portioned for the price point.  My son's fish and chips were generously portioned as well.  The entrees were decent.  The $3 salsa was not very good.  It turned out the beers were $4.50 or something.  Nothing crazy that couldn't be printed on a menu.\n\nDinner tab for the two of us and our son was $50.  Inexpensive and filling, but not enjoyable.  Lyndsey was not a good server.  Her attitude was poor and she should learn the prices.\n\nDefinitely will not be making another stop in."
0,"First off, this restaurant is absolutely HUGE. there are a ton of tables, so i'm going to say that this place is good for groups..  When we went on a friday night, there were only about 7 tables occupied, with my friend and I sitting alone at the sushi bar.\n\nWe came here because we wanted sushi and rolls.  None of the pittsburgh restaurants seem to specialize very much in rolls, and of the sushi restaurants near shadyside/oakland, this one seemed to offer the most number of rolls (please let me know if you know of other ones nearby that offer more!)  We got a 12 piece combination sushi platter, a kim's favorite roll (which actually seemed like two separate rolls totaling 16 pieces), and a spider roll.  While the sushi and rolls were of acceptable size, the fish was definitely not very fresh.  the spider roll was probably one of the most repulsive rolls i've tasted in a while.  the soft shell crab was fried beyond recognition, and it took too much effort to chew as the crunching resounded loudly within my head.\n\nMy friend and I also split a soon doo boo, which came with a bowl of rice and a few miniplates of banchan.  while the soon doo boo was acceptable, with a lot of tofu inside, the banchan was pretty underwhelming. broccoli, pretty weak kimchi, bean sprouts...\n\nand sadly our bill came out to be way too much for a regular sushi dinner. after tax and tip, my friend and i each paid ~35.  while the service was friendly, i will probably not be coming back here again."
1,Kid friendly place located in old town vegas district! Has some really cool places to check and hipster shops.
1,"Their drive thru is the only way I have ever experienced Z.  I have enjoyed just about everything I have had here thus far.  Every time I go it is essential I get a side salad (with all that wonderful feta), hummus, tsatziki, and falafel.  The fries are not my favorite side there.  \nTheir gyros are good not great and I still have several items to try on the menu.  The pita leaves much to be desired, almost like it is warmed in a microwave, as soon as it cools it 's tough and dry. Sad as the pita makes the meal, typically, at Mediterranean restaurant. But it also won't keep me from going back..."
1,"Went in \""just to look\"" at clubs, and left with a really cool Nike set.  Steve was very patient with me and my husband and didn't try to upsell us in any way.  I took practice swings with clubs from different sets and received several helpful hints to help me make the correct decision.  Prices were fair.  What I really liked was that Las Vegas Golf & Tennis felt more comfortable than Golf Galaxy.  I look forward to returning soon to check out the clothing section."
0,We've eaten here several times because as the other poster said there can be off nights. At first it was ok...not good but really the only thing close by. It declined in that we got sick after eating this...twice. We will NEVER ear here again and will drive somewhere else.
0,"Ok, here's the deal. Those wristbands they hand out get you into the wristband line. Nothing more. The admission is standard fare but that's not the issue. I paid $48, yes, that's $48 friggin dollars for a TINY kamikaze and 2 red bull vodkas. Granted, they used good booze, but not near 48 dollars good. The club was fun but the DJ needed some improvement. It was a Monday but come on, give the people some good music, not auditory sodomy. And good luck finding the exit. They filter you out the back past the restrooms. All in all, not going back."
0,"This place was disappointing! The service was fine and our waiter was friendly, but nothing spectacular. We went to dinner as a group of four and were promptly seated. The ambience wasn't bad, but we all hated how dark it was in the booth area we were in. We are all fairly young (mid-twenties to early thirties), yet felt like we had aged because it was so dark we couldn't read the menus printed on black paper. Turns out we weren't the only ones having issues as we saw other waiters turn on mini flash flights for other patrons to read their menus! Ridiculous. \n\nWe each had different margaritas and didn't think much of them. We didn't bother ordering additional rounds as we had all planned to. Can't remember the specific name of my dish, but the description in the menu sounded great so I ordered it. My friends had the beef fajitas. We got our plates and well... mine looked EXACTLY like theirs with the exception of having a small side of rice. A little frustrating when the descriptions AND prices were different. On top of that, the food was bland. I pretty much just poured the rest of the salsa (from the chips and salsa to start) to have some sort of taste. There was no flavor in anything and the steak pieces were dry and overcooked. It was truly a disappointing meal, especially given the price. \n\nThe only saving grace in this place were the chips and salsa. Those were definitely tasty, but that is not enough to return to this place."
1,"I tried three different times to go to Tina's--something I had really looked forward to when I returned to Chandler--but found the place closed all three times.  This was a new location across the street from the original one and looked totally different inside when I looked thru the window.  Finally, on the third try on my last day in  town, I went into the bar next door to ask the lady bartender if she had any info.  To my great disappointment she said it was closed for good.  What a shame!  Tina--If you're out there and read this get in touch with me and let me know if you ever re-open!"

0,"I stayed Mon-Fri....As soon as we arrived we noticed our room was warm and the bathroom fan didn't work....we contacted the front desk and were assured that engineering would check it out...my son's room was nice and cool with a working bathroom fan....one to two hours later we inquired again and again were assured that engineering would check it out.....Well, of course the promised repairs never occurred during the five days we were there........room was old with a tube tv....internet available with connection from tv......nothing great about this place....trays left in the hallway for hours on end....disturbing!.....will not stay again...."
1,"What a cool bar! \n\nI had been driving around the neighbourhood, doing some shopping, and was in need of a quick adult beverage. Open the Yelp app (of course!) and up pops this gem.\n\nPlenty of parking behind the bar, inside has vintage video games, pool tables and lots of TVs. The bartender was Paula (I love it when bartenders introduce themselves, it's classy and makes it easier to ask for another drink) She was very friendly and personable and let me know that they were running a lunch time special of a burger or two tacos for a dollar, but that time was about to end. I ordered the tacos and they were great. Not just \""great for a dollar\"" great, but genuinely great.\n\nBackground music was at a normal level and they seemed to have a good selection of liquors. Only weird thing was no tap beer. That seemed a little odd to me, but whatevs."
0,Just ate here and the younger of the 3 chefs was very rude and arrogant...talking down to everyone...it was our first time there and I will never go back...food wise it was okay...we had the all you can eat dinner and it was no match for hiker restaurant down the road...we spent over $150.00 on decent Japanese food being served by a Japanese prick...btw I am Japanese myself and I was shocked by how we were treated...shame...
1,"Good food aplenty at this upscale yet casual cafe at the Encore (Wynn) right next to the club XS.  Simple, priced right, and a nice standard beer menu to wash it down.\n\nIf you are a truffling ho like me (not to be confused with a \""trifling ho\""), Society's menu will have you tricking with your mouth in two seconds flat.  Liberal administration of truffle oil / butter / miscellaneous creamy goodness will have you so weak at the knees I can hardly speak I lose all control then something takes over me.  SWV!\n\nBut all kidding aside, truffling hoes will want to avail yourselves and open your mouths to receive the culinary prowess I suggest to the following items you must say yes.  (repeat this sentence in your best Spoken Word voice).\n\nItem Number 1 - The Mac & Cheese Bites.  Every fat kid loves him some Mac & Cheese, and as a former man-breast recipient, I am no except to this rule.  But just like a nice, plump, man-breast, every classic dish needs a nice, hard twist.  Here's Society's twist on Mac & Cheese:  They place their Mac & Cheese into magically delicious and geometrically perfect cubes (with batter of some sort), and fry the living daylights out of them.  The result is a double whammy of flavor, first of the miscellaneous fried pleasure that can make the fishiest of fish and the blandest of vegetables taste like heaven (or I guess, hell, for you goth kids that can't relate), and second, of the Mac & Cheese, duh.  AND I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO THE BEST PART YET!  You dip the Mac & Cheese bites into a truffle oil / butter / sauce concoction!  What happens next, in your mouth, folks, is mindblowing.  Not quite as mindblowing as Ricky Martin coming out of the closet, but mindblowing nonetheless.  \n\nItem Number 2 - The Trenne.\n\nI'm all about portmanteaus - \""shart\"" being a particular favorite of mine.  But \""trenee\"" is definitely a close second.  It is a combination of \""triangle\"" and \""penne\"" and explains the peculiarly-shaped pasta used in this dish.  It is, well, triangular penne.  Kind of like a hollow prism.  Actually, exactly like a hollow prism.  But I digress - the shape of the pasta has nothing to do with the flavor of this dish.  This pasta dish is served with a truffle cream sauce, crispy prosciutto, real truffles, and peas.  Men - I can all but guarantee that this dish will get you laid.  Women - I can all but guarantee that some man will read my review and buy you this dish.\n\nTheir bone-in peppercorn dry-rub rib-eye (say that ten times fast) is spectacular too, but c'mon, who writes about steak these days?  That was so 2004.\n\nThis place left a good taste in my mouth.  So good, in fact, that I didn't brush my teeth last night so I could taste it in the morning.  \n\nI will be back, Society Cafe Encore, I will be back.\n\nHappy truffling!"
0,Not only are they the SLOWEST pharmacy they very seldom have the medication in stock that you will need. Do yourself a favor and go down the road and don't even bother stopping here they're going to send you to Desert Inn location anyways.
0,"I have visited this museum 3 or 4 times over the last couple of years. Fortunately, my husband can occasionally get us in for free so that's when we go. Like this past weekend, for example. \n\nThe current exhibit, which runs through January 2012, is \""A Sense of Place.\"" But the sense I got was that they just threw some paintings together to try to fit a theme. I'm sure if you are an art major you would totally disagree with me; but for the general public, the art seems to be chaotically set up. \n\nIt starts off with paintings from the mid- to late-1800's and they fit the theme: a painting of Venice, a painting of a French countryside. Next thing you know, you are looking at a sketch from Christo and Jean-Claude (who did The Gates in Central Park a few years ago) from the 1960's. It was quite a jump in the evolution of art. Well no matter, I figured, since the next dozen paintings were from the late 1900's and still (mostly) fit the theme. Walked into the next room and what do you know? A painting by Monet and a photo of a golf course from a couple years ago. Like I said, it seemed chaotically set up. \n\nThe last room was probably the worst; not in terms of the art itself, but just the fact that it didn't really seem to fit the theme or a logical order. There was a sculpture of a cloud....which I *guess* you can say is a \""Sense of Place\"" and then a pop art piece by Lichtenstein and then some other stuff I've (sadly) already forgot. \n\nI really really really want this town to have a decent for-reals museum like other cities. One where you feel like a $15 entry is worth the price. And I really don't want to be so harsh on this place since we need some culture in this town and this is one of the few places to get it. Again, the paintings themselves are great to look at....they just seem to be haphazardly thrown together so you are left scratching your head. \n\nA few years ago, we saw the Ansel Adams exhibit at Bellagio and I would have probably given that 4-stars. It was very memorable and I learned a lot from it. This exhibit however... I don't think it justifies the price tag. Maybe if there was a more logical order to the pieces and if the audio guides had more detail I could have bumped it up to 3 stars. But for now I will say, don't bother (unless you are seriously in love with art)... and let's wait til January to see what the next exhibit will be."
1,Renovated rooms - lots of things to do. No problems here.
0,"Went in for breakfast this morning and had a great meal.  I had the pancakes with egg whites....wonderful meal.  My husband had the breakfast burrito and really enjoyed it.  Everything is freshly prepared and made to order. \n\nWE were really enjoying our time until we were ready to leave.  At this time, I watched as one of the employees climbed onto the food prep counter to grab a container of protein powder that was above her reach.  She stood on the food prep counter with her shoes on...yuck.  Would not have been that big of a deal...but she didn't disinfect the counter or even wipe it off before she started using the exact same surface to prepare a smoothie for the next customer.  She put fresh fruit and vegetables on the counter in the exact spot she was just standing.  She saw me watching her and didn't seem to think it was a big deal.  \n\nI would assume this would violate a dozen or so health codes.  The bottom of shoes are filled with all kinds of disgusting things and belong no where near food prep.  After seeing this, I won't be back.  I don't think I can trust the cleanliness of the establishment.\n\nThis revelation makes me sad as I have always enjoyed my food here and raved about it."
0,"I ordered the Double Steak Burger California Style without the buns because I'm on a low carb diet.  It was good to know that they can accommodate you on that front.  So  my burger was kind like the protein burger from In and Out.  The only problem was, the patties were under seasoned.  I think this may have been the first time ever I had to salt my burger.  The patties were smashed so they're flat kinda like smash burgers' patties.  I was a bit disappointed about how, the only difference between my burger and whatever it is my husband ordered was that, mine had tomatoes.  I wish they could have made it more exciting like perhaps adding avocados to go with the title, \""California Style\"".\n\nI have yet to try the frozen custard.  I hope its worth coming back for."
1,"We have been coming here for 2 years now and we love it! It's so hard to find a good NY style Chinese place in AZ and this comes close.

0,"This review is for their conference room and attending an event here, I've never stayed at this Marriott.\n\nI've been to two presentation events here, and the food has been awful both times. \n\nIt was a breeze for parking and the location is ideal, but when the food is flavorless, over-cooked, and tastes worse than airplane food, I would not recommend any company host their events here"
0,"I had a mixed bag experience at Tempe Camera. I went to have two point-and-shoot digital cameras looked at to see if they were worth repairing. The two ladies in repair were really friendly and helpful. They were honest that it was not worth the money to repair them because it would end up costing more than a new camera, but then they got one camera working! They even gave me a couple batteries, which was very nice.\n\nI then proceeded upstairs to the sales dept. to look for a replacement for my little point-and-shoot that I use to photograph jewelry. The salesman was condescending and argumentative. He made me feel about two inches tall. He was challenging and not at all helpful. It was an extremely uncomfortable experience and I couldn't wait to get away from him, but even after I said I needed to do more research, he kept talking, telling me all the ways I was wrong about the camera I wanted and how I was using it.\n\nThis seems to be a great place for the professional or serious hobbyist, but my experience in the salesroom was pretty dismal."
1,"Went to dinner last night with my dad and boyfriend and the food was great.  Seated instantly with no reservation, but it was pretty full for a Tuesday night.  You are greeted by your waiter and given complimentary bottled water.  They also provide a yummy bread basket, must try the pretzel bread!  The food was wonderful the prices were great, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it was so smokey.  I am not talking cigar or cigarette smoke, it's smokey because the chef cooks in the middle of the restaurant.  Now don't get me wrong it looks really cool, but after the meal and the next morning I was coughing felt like I had smoked a cigar or something.  So if smoke doesn't bother you then you'll love this place.  It is wonderful just be prepared.  \n\n8oz filet was $38 \n12oz filet was $48\n\n*all entrees come with choice of black bean soup (which is delicious) or salad\n*garlic mashed potatoes (so good), baked potato, or rice pilaf\n*chef's veggies\n\n**We did not get an appetizer and we were full... still couldn't finish everything on our plates!!!!\n\n*****Great food, great price, amazing portions!"
1,"Allegedly some of the finest BBQ to be found in Canada if the accolades are to be believed. Having spent a year in the US South I tend to have a very skewed perspective on what good/bad BBQ is. Blackstrap is definitely not a threat to most southern big name pitmasters but does a good job in their own right at keeping the tradition alive and well up north.\n\nThe ribs got picked clean on my visit. Chicken just as well despite a tiny bit of dryness. Didn't touch the bun as I'm watching my gluten but it whispered seducdively to me with its fresh baked scent.\n\nCome early for lunch or risk getting stuck in the loooong line winding all the way out the door and into the street. Oh, and have those wet wipes handy before you dig in."
0,"Too pricey, and does not offer a good coffee. As a daily homemade coffee drinker (not Starbucks), this shop provides a HoRRIBLe horrible coffee. I can't call it coffee at all. My cafe au lait taste like water with milk, the regular coffee taste like the brew has been sitting there for 24 hours. Eww!!! Never come back. Should have listened to my husband for breakfast buffet. Two stars because of the sitting area."
0,"I didn't think it was true that the portions of meat were rediculous but sure enough..  They only put 3 oz. of meat on their sandwhiches I opened mine it I thought to myself, I'm better off going to the NICE Subway on Warm Springs and Buffalo.  Atleast they give you more than a slice of each meat and more toppings.  I could of made this at home for the price I paid I expected a little more. The only reason we came here was because we're locals and had food comps from the casino, buy a PREMIUM sandwhich and get chips & a drink free. \n\nI ordered the Italian on a white loaf for 5.99, the chips were 1.29 and the fountain drink is 1.99.  What a rip off $10.02, glad I only paid for just the sandwich..  I doubt we'll ever be back.  Super disappointing.  By the way, I'll have you know my bf opened his bag of chips and hated them.  I tried them out of his bag and ended up putting back my bag of chips. BUT they do have free wifi for those of you who do like this place.  Too over priced and touristy, I'm all set.\n\nBut hey if people like this place, I must be crazy look at all these 5 star reviews.  I would have to be heavily intoxicated to eat here."
0,"One of the worst hotel experiences of my life. This hotel was represented on hotwire as a luxury 4 star resort. Yet all the negative reviews you read on yelp DIRECTLY applied to our room. Our \""non smoking\"" room reeked of smoke, the television cut out randomly, the shower wouldn't drain properly, and it was obvious the entire room hadn't been updated since the 80's. To make matters worse, hotwire did not tell me that the hotel charged a \""pet fee\"" of $75. Had I known this, I would have booked at a nicer resort outside of hotwire and actually saved a bit of money. After I complained, the hotel did eventually move us to a new room that was much nicer, but my girlfriend accidentally left a shirt and sandals behind in the old room that somehow disappeared. Then to add insult to injury, the hotel charged us an excessive amount of fees at the end of our stay. I had signed for the pet fee and some room service charges of $117 at checkout, but my card was run for 4 separate occasions totaling over $240.00. Needles to say, I'm going to be fighting these charges and calling the better business bureau. I'm absolutely livid. I'd give this place 0 stars if I could. I'm also done with hotwire and their misleading bait and switch tactics. It's obvious this \""resort\"" is on its last legs and trying desperately to hang on to its 4 star rating. The only way they can stay full and put people in their outdated and run down rooms is to use a service like hotwire."
1,"This hotel was great. Lobby hosts were super sweet. My phones weren't hooked up in the room when I got in, but maintenance came and fixed it up in a flash, and with a smile. The design is nice, and there's plenty of room in the king room. Best part was the strong wifi signal. I was able to do work, surf the internet, catch up on my Netflix and play some video games. Anytime my free wifi is that good I'm a happy bunny.\n\nThe hotel has free shuttle service to the airport, but be sure to schedule 1 drop off prior to the one you need...I ended up waiting 20 minutes for the driver to come out to the van at the hotel. He was apologetic and sweet when he was there, but it's still rough when you're trying to catch a flight or manage your itinerary. Tip: they will drive you anywhere within their radius, so check out what's around and don't be shy to ask for a ride somewhere nearby!\n\nSpeaking of nearby, it's only about 15 minutes anywhere (Southpark Mall, Target, restaurants, etc) by car, so if you have a rental this is still a good option!\n\nAll in all, I would absolutely stay again if I ever find myself in the Charlotte airport area overnight again."
1,"Wonderful small bbq. Gotta try the pulled pork. Try without sauce then with it. The sauce makes a difference. The ribs are fall off the bone. Eat like a vacuum. Sides need work, but ur there for the bbq. Still 5 stars. Prices are very low for a lot of food."
1,"This place was really good.  Celebrated a friends birthday dinner while on vacation in Vegas here.  They ambiance and decorations are very pretty.  The cocktails are good and they have an extensive wine list.\n\nMy friend (whose birthday it was) is vegan.  They even have a special extensive vegan menu.  I ordered the tomato salad.  It had heirloom tomatoes, balsamic vinegar and bread coated and cooked goat cheese balls to garnish.  (i love goat cheese).  My main course was a chicken with mushrooms and sauce.  They even had 4 kinds of bread that they brought including some delicious cheese crisps with herbs.  For dessert we had sorbet (several flavors and also vegan).  I am not vegan at all and I didn't even notice a difference. \n\nSinatra is a bit pricey but it was definitely worth it.  Everything I ordered was cooked perfectly and the service was very good as well."

0,"I have been to many clubs in Las Vegas and this one is just okay. The music was not great and there was nothing really special about the experience at all. If you are a dude who has to pay to get into a club, skip it - if you are a lady who has to wait in line, skip it. Thankfully our group of 5 girls got in free and didnt have to wait in line. If you do want to go to this club look for one of the promoters in the casino and grab a few wristbands so you dont have to wait in line."
1,"Not what I expected at all! In a good way. I figured a casino hotel outside, and I mean WAY south of the main \""strip\"" would be a dive. It turns out that this is a hidden gem. The casino is a big and as well appointed as any of the major casinos. The rooms are large and more importantly clean. The pool is wonderful as is their hot tub and exercise rooms. \n\nI've been to the strip many times so this was refreshing. We had a car so no big deal to get on the freeway and zip over to the strip if we wanted. It was actually nice not to be in the middle of the chaos for once. You'll pay less per night too."
1,"Pros:\nMiddle of the lane mall. Doesn't have the overly cosmopolitan/snobby feel of the Fashion Show and Forum Shops, doesn't have the tourist bullshit of the Miracle Mile, not as ghetto fabulous as the Boulevard. \nInexpensive.\nSPENCERS!\nHolds(or held) a lot of childhood memories for me.\n\nCons:\nHas a lot of the same stores as the Boulevard, but not as good a selection.\nWas a lot better when I was a kid.\nWeird location that's in a kind of depressing neighborhood."
1,"I was craving caffeine, so I walked into Press and I tried an almond milk latte from. The latte was high quality, rich in flavor, and made properly. Service was also prompt. I will definitely be back!"
1,"A great addition to this area. The dining and patio areas were nice and well kept. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I love that I can order my burger protein, or green style as they called it. Their chocolate custard was heavenly! We will go back.\n\nI wish they had sweet potato fries!"
1,"I love wine and trying a bunch of different wines. I have seen Kokopelli wines in Sedona and wanted to try them so I was highly enthused to see they were within a couple miles of my house!\n\nSo I'm going to be honest... since shaving my head, I test people's ability to not judge a book by its cover, especially when I'm a customer.  I watch carefully how I am treated to see if there is any change that's different from what I was normally get with my longer hair.\n\nThis place was NO ISSUE at all.  I could have walked in with purple skin for all they cared.  That was a plus right up front.\n\nWe were seated promptly on a Thursday night to some really nice live music.  He was enjoyable, talking with the other patrons and with us.  His music was excellent to listen to while eating also, not too loud or anything.\n\nWaitress was fine... she was attentive, no issues with her.\n\nWe ordered the crab and artichoke appetizer and it clearly wasn't what I expected.  It actually had a texture and taste of an excellent chunky soup that I could have had, rather than a dip.  It was slightly bland but good, just totally against what I expected that it kinda threw me off. \n\nI was hoping my food wouldn't turn out like that.\n\nI had the pasta Danielle which was very good, although again slightly bland.  Had the spice it needed, but didn't have taste behind it.\n\nThe key here... add salt.  I hate adding salt as typically most dishes have enough to begin with, but these clearly didn't.  As soon as I added salt, it was great.\n\nThe wines are awesome... love the Sweet Lucy, which is a sweet red.  I also had the Merlot which is awesome also.  I'm not one for Chianti's, but my partner had a Chianti and it was better than some german chianti's I've tried.\n\nThe decor of wine barrels on the wall is nice and comfortable, a bar in the center of everything with a tv which appeared to have a good selection of alcohol.\n\nThere was a good number of people in there for a Thursday night, which surprised me.  Most of the patrons were of senior age, which may explain the food.\n\nI will go back though to try some more."
0,"Have had great service in the past - staffing is clearly an issue. Waited quite a while to be greeted, then chose to sit in the bar area after seeing the dining room chaos going on.  I waited 11 minutes and was not even acknowledged so I left. \n\nAfter sharing with a friend, found out they had service issues the day before.  That party had been warned that the bar area server would take up to 15 minutes before helping you. That warning came from a Chili's staff member. Yikes!"
0,"How does Nadine C. have such great experiences everywhere!?  Granted, we went to the deli area to get some slices to-go to eat in our room since we had crawfish for dinner like five-hours prior but does it make that much of a difference to dine-in?  Apparently!\n\nFor $21-something, we got three giant slices of pie [one Hawaiian, one veggie, and a meat combo].  The pizza itself was thin and soggy and all the toppings were on the verge of sliding off and into my lap.  Not a great start.  While the bites with toppings and cheese had okay flavor, once you hit the crust, it's game over.  Tasteless!  \n\nSlice of Vegas is quick and speedy but they could use some work on developing more flavor.  What I would have done for a packet of crushed red pepper.  Meh!"
0,"Not happy with this place at all! Not clean. Cheap linens and bedding. Hall carpeting was dirty, elevators were dirty and old, one broke down on Thanksgiving with a woman stuck inside for over an hour!.\nHousekeeping left some weird red cleaner all over the base of the toilet, forgot to leave coffee a couple of times and the beds  looked like they were thrown together with the sheets not tucked in and one bedspread missing.\nWould not recommend this hotel even at the low cost. Pay $20-$30 more a night and stay somewhere else."
1,I love this place!  The Shallot Salt is worth a trip alone! Great on steak. Everyone in Charlotte should make a trip to this lovely little shop. Great gift packages too.
1,"We moved into our home in 2009 and got rid of the carpet and placed wood flooring. We love the wood floors! We did most of the house except for the 3 unoccupied bedrooms. We figured we could budget for it later and leave the carpet there for now. \n\nWell, we are now expecting our first little one and are in a mad dash to get his nursery done. We knew we wanted the wood floors for his nursery because it's so much cleaner & easier to maintain than carpet. We went back to the same company we originally purchased the floors from but they did not have any in stock. We went shopping around at other places and it was quite expensive and the wood was not exactly the same.\n\nWe finally found the exact product at Nulook and they were able to give us a great price and have it shipped in a timely manner. The transaction was seamless. They were professional & friendly. I would recommend them to anyone looking for new flooring."
1,"First time visiting Wisconsin, and by far one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. \nWe had the special on Friday night, the service was quick and extremely professional. The special was delicate beef drenched in a beer-maple sauce, cooked to absolute perfection. \nThe cheeseboard we ordered was also quite exceptional, filled with some of the best cheese Wisconsin has to offer. I'd highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the area or going to a Badgers game. I'll certainly be back to visit, if not for a game, for the food!"
1,"The people at Glenfair Veterinary Hospital are fantastic. The price for any service here is easily one-third of anywhere else, and the service you receive is genuine. They truly care about your pets and you can feel it the minute you walk in the door. I live in East Phoenix, but I'll drive the 30 minutes to give Glenfair my business."
1,"I have a couple of quirky friends I meet up with once a month or so, and we just have so much fun.  I wanted a diner waffle and sausage this time, along with coffee, and it really hit the spot.  The wait staff is friendly and the food is reasonable priced...this is by no means a fine dining establishment but it's pretty hard to screw up the basics!  Definitely on the regular rotation!"
1,"Wow, hidden gem.  The spring rolls are so fresh and awesome!  I also had the #17 with shrimp, omg yum!  I asked for medium spice and I probably should have gone with mild because it was pretty spicy, but great flavor!  I can't wait to go back and try the green curry!"
0,"I don't see what the fad is here...maybe I'm not drunk or it's cause I'm from SoCal so I grew up eating deliciously cheap tacos (for like 75 cents). I thought this place was ridiculous expensive for tacos. Sure, they put on a show, and it's a popular place for locals. I tried the asada, lengua and adobada. I thought the adobada was the most flavorful out of the three. The others, didn't really stand out. The food tastes decent (I'd give it 3-3.5 stars at most) but I just can't get over the price! (hence the 2 stars)"
1,Only review I will ever write. Sober. This is the best bang for your buck on Vegas if you want sushi. Amazing.
0,"I HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE AT THE MGM SIGNATURE SUITES!!\n\nI came to vegas for M fest and to catch up with some friends, whom I haven't seen in over a year.  I was really excited to stay at the MGM signature due to all the fabulous reviews, plus I got a discount through my credit card travel services.  I booked the Balcony Deluxe Suites, for only one night (and thank god we only stayed for 1 night).  \n\nI show up to the hotel and the gate security was very kind and cordial, I ended up arriving to vegas 4 hours before our 3pm checkin, but concierge was gracious enough to hold our bags till our time came up.  \n\nWe come back to the hotel after our lunch to find that the nearby convention crowd were all staying at the hotel.  It literally took 1.5 hrs to get to our room on the 3rd floor, because the lines to the elevator were so DAMN long. The concierge told us to lounge in the lobby or by the pool until the lines die down.  The convention crowd was like a sex and the city woman gathering.. I have never seen that many women in my entire life and they were all chattering in unison.. it was so strange.  \n\nI finally get to my room and... there's no FUCKING BALCONY.  I specially paid more to get a room with a balcony and my room was just a regular room..  I didn't complain because I was so exhausted from just waiting in the elevator line.. I brought this issue up during my checkout and all they did was WAIVE my $28 resort fee.. WTF can you FUCKING REFUND ME THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO ROOMS??! .. I have talked to my chase travel services and the hotel will not do anything about it!! Their customer service sucks ass.... I recommend you stay at the other hotels like Paris or Cosmopolitan. \n\nI'm disappointed!"
0,"Despite what people say, this place does not even come close to Schwartz's across the street. I will stand in line with the \""tourists\"" to get the real deal anytime."
1,"This is a favorite brunch spot with friends. Two words: eldorado eggs.\n\nThey have a pretty fun&unique brunch menu with a lot of non-standard options - so you are bound to try something new. Bloody Marys are really good, but I recommend the Bloody Maria... It's an adventure. Also of note- they have a robust tequila selection as well.\n\nThe service is generally good , however drinks always take a while.\n\nI wouldn't go out of your way to go here, but if you live in Madison, make a stop sometime. (disclaimer- I've never eaten dinner here)"
1,"What a total hidden gem!  I went in today for a reflexology treatment and one hour massage (based off the glowing yelp reviews!).  \n\nI was pleasantly greeted by a young woman (she must get worked over daily with massages, as she was ridiculously nice), asked to fill out a brief form, and even though I was pretty early for my appointment, Jason took me right away.  Which was awesome.  I hate to wait, even  when I'm way early.\n\nWe started with the reflexology treatment, and WOW.  I have had what spas and clinics call \""reflexology\"", but this was the real deal.  You sit in a chair to start with your feet soaking, while getting a shoulder, neck, arm and hand massage.  I was zoned at this point.  The pressure was perfect (meaning very firm).  Jason really knows body work, as he honed in on my rough spots without me having to mention it.  Which was also fabulous, since I was quickly losing the ability to speak.  lol\n\nThen, you lie on the table, fully clothed with your pants rolled up to your knees (SO happy I wore sweats), with a nice warm towel covering your torso.  The reflexology massage was AMAZING.  Jason also massaged my legs up to my knees AND, did head, face, ears...  Pure bliss.  Honestly, at the end, I realized my respiration and heart rate were super low, as I was soooo insanely relaxed.  This rarely (ok, never) happens for me, as I tend to be rather, ahem, high energy.   I don't think I'm even this mellow when sleeping and dreaming of kittens and rainbows.\n\nAt this point, a massage was probably overkill, or so I thought.  At the end of the second hour, I thought I was on the moon, and could have been, for all I knew.  The massage was totally solid.\n\nThe owner (Mary) spoke to me when I was leaving, and what a sweet, charming, and smart lady!\n\nIf you want to support our local small businesses, get an incredible reflexology massage and most excellent body massage, go to Mary's.  You won't be disappointed."
0,"Shut down due to change of ownership and \""remodeling\"". Hmmm check out the health dept violations. Disgusting!"
1,"The food was definitely fresh and delicious!  Very Pricey but you pay for the freshness, personalize service and ambiance. Great experience! Master Chef Miguel gave us his best menu for the night! A definite yes to Las Vegas nightlife and opulence!"

1,"This is a good, affordable French restaurant.  Food is probably 3 stars.  4 stars for the ability to eat on the patio.\n\nWe ordered primarily side dishes and sat outside on their patio, watching people walk by on the strip and sort of seeing the Bellagio fountains across the street.  The french onion soup and ratatouille were solid.  Not the best in the world, but good."
0,"Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh. This place needs a colossal amount of love. Why did I let myself be swayed by the 4-star average? Why oh why did I encourage my colleagues to join me in eating here? There was nowhere to sit comfortably. The \""best seat in the house\"" is located next to a disturbingly noisy TV and radio. The Pad Thai is fine enough, I guess. Man, it's juicy noodles looked great. It's the chicken that cleared my appetite. It had this awfully gamey taste, sort of unclean and offal-like. I kept trying to disguise the flavor by continuously squeezing lime over the dish. And poor old Edamame was sad, while Potstickers needed some real affection. You know, the people who work here seem very nice, and for their sake I hope they step it up a big fat notch. Noodle & Rice, it's time for an extreme makeover."
1,"I get the carnitas tacos with a side of chips (approx $6). Load up on the free sauce and veggies, and head out. The food is always good and it tastes good too. As good as Chipolte and half the price, this is my go-to lunch spot near CSN."
0,"I have lived in AZ for over 25 years and had heard this was a nice place to go. For our 27 Anniversary we decided to give it a try. We had planned to sit outside but the night we went it happened to be a very chilly night because of a recent system going through the state so we sat inside. \n\nWe had drinks- gin and tonics. I had the house gin and my husband had the tanqueray. Mine tasted very chemical-ly. Noticeably different than my husbands. So I got the El Chorro Bloody Mary after that and it was good. \n\nThen we tried some appetizers- I got the grilled cheeses- very greasy. I didn't realize (nor do they tell you in the menu) that every piece has a different cheese inside. I am not a fan of blue cheese and of course that was the first one I ate. It was gross. And also the last one I ate.  My husband had the sausage plate and he enjoyed it. \n\nFor dinner I had the special- prime rib. I asked for the end cut hoping it would not be crawling rare. Nope. It was. It was a huge piece of meat and I took most of it home, cooked it a little more, and then sliced it and added it to a salad. The twice baked potato and veggies that came with my meal were cold. Nothing fries me more than paying $200 for a meal and it being cold. Sigh. My husband had the pork tenderloin . He liked it. It came with a pile of carrots and broccolini. Niether of which he ate, and some kind of orzo which was ok. \n\nThen we tried dessert- he wanted to try the home churned ice cream. He liked it. I got the gooey caramel butter cake. It had some ice cream on top. It was ok.\n\nI guess I was expecting to be blown away and wasn't. It was just ok. I probably would not go back and would not recommend anyone else go. For the price it just didn't wasn't over the top. Our server was ok. They couldn't manage to get the Dbacks on the big screen that was near us. Hmmm. Why? And something else kind of weirded me out. The hostess had a nice ruffley dress on- appropriate for this type of place yet she had flip flops on. Not nice ones, but kind of too casual ratty ones. That didn't impress me either."
1,I mean BEST bbq in the world... and I have eaten a lot of bbq in my day.  You have to wait to be seated and the place is always jammed. No reservations friends but I'll tell ya it's always worth the wait.  Can't wait you say... too hungry? Okay then call in your order and pick it up.  Black dog tastes just as good on your couch. Also little pearl of wisdom here... in a bind for Dad's weekend and don't want to fight the crowds?  Or for graduation?  Black dog caters (sort of).  Just call ahead and order what ever you need.  Then skip all the waiting and drive up to the back door at which point they will load pounds of meat and yummy yummy food into your car.  Best decision I ever made for Dad's weekend was ordering food from Black dog.
1,"Perfect anniversary dinner.  Everything was wonderful, from food to ambiance to wine.   Highly recommend.  Had salmon sashimi warm slow roasted beets rack of lamb and sirloin.  Only complaint was that for some reason the drink service was a little slow."
1,"I have only eaten here a few times but the sushi was good every time. I like the unique rolls from here and they come out quickly. They are a little bit on the pricey side, but the food is always great and the rolls are large. I would recommend this sushi spot."
0,Only really worth it if you get the unlimited pass as each ride is only a few seconds long. But then you shouldn't do the rides multiple times - I'm not even 30 and I developed herniated discs after doing them.
0,"Yuck yuck yuck... I can't believe this place has good reviews.  It must be because a majority of the reviews are written by people who stop here after a night out of drinking.  \n\nThe other night I was craving some Mexican food and instead of going to the other Mexican joint that's less than a block away, I decided to try Amados.  Big mistake.... huge.  Sure, it's open 24 hours but, so is the competitor around the corner... and they offer tasty food!\n\nMy chicken chimichanga plate was gross on a buncha levels,  First off, it's obvious the oil hadn't been changed in a while because I could SMELL the deep-fried tortilla... and not in a good way.  After a test bite or two, I decided I'd just eat the chicken inside but, it was SOOO SALTY that I literally ended up throwing most of it out.  I have never ever done that to a chimichanga before.  :(  Finally, the beans and rice had almost no flavor.  I don't even know how that's possible... rice sure.  Beans tho?!  \n\nBecause of the 4 stars I was thinking I should give it another try but honestly, just can't stomach the idea of it.  \n\nWon't see ya there!"
1,"Looking for a place to eat Korean in Charlotte isn't the easiest thing to do. So when I found this place on Yelp it got my attention. Once I got there I wasn't sure which door to use. FYI, use the door on the side of the business. You will go in to a Korean grocery store and to the right is a small restaurant. Once I got seated I forgot there was a store. I'm grateful to have Mother-in-law that cooks the best Korean food I will ever have. I will say tonight I found a place that is very close to it. Very friendly and VERY fast service. Everything seemed to be traditional Korean style. All the sides (fresh), spicy pork and my green tea for $10. I have found a spot I know I will go back. I can't wait to take my family."
0,"This hotel needs a major revamp! We paid for an upgraded room this weekend and it was awful. There were several holes in the sheets on both beds, hair in the sink & shower, the vent above the shower head was covered in a heavy layer of dust, the closet didn't have any hangars, the sink did not drain well if you ran the water for more than 5 seconds. The air conditioning didn't seem to work well and was extremely loud and bothersome while sleeping.\n\nOwnership and management really should  asses the cleanliness of rooms."
0,"Horrible rooms,  this use to be a great hotel at a good price.  Now the rooms suck. The walls are like paper, you can hear everything.  I don't recommend this place at all."
0,It does not EVEN deserve a star at all! This place sucks!!! Believe me it sucks!!!\nIt is not authentic Filipino food!  I'm so mad I wna punch everything around me!!\nI ordered the chicharon bulaklak what the hell was that taste and it looked like\nSomeone just took a crap on your plate! Lechon kawali looked like duck... I mean what the hell and the taste was soo bad it wasn't even the right crunchyness! The meat was sooo dry tasted like something a freaking oger would eat! Ahhhh ahhhh!!! I'm so pissed!!! Ahhhhhhh!!!! This piece of crap place ruined my night!! I was so hungry expecting a nice delicious meal but no!!! Ahhhhhh!! Shut this place down!!! Never come here!!! NOBODY PLEASE COME HERE! SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!! PLEASE This is my first review and unfortunately it was a bad review.. *sigh my rant is done
1,"Incredibly delicious menu, many choices from gourmet burgers to seafood, pasta and salads.  Something for everyone. Extensive wine list & signature cocktails.  Exceptional atmosphere, indoor outdoor seating.  Highly recommend whether a special occasion or just looking for a great place to dine and socialize!"
1,"There is nothing like riding your cruiser to La Grande Orange on a Sat or Sun. This is a great place to listen to the music and people watch, while enjoying a nice breakfast, salad, sandwich, pizza, coffee or glass of sangria. It's usually busy, but fairly laid-back. Grab today's paper, bring your laptop and enjoy the ambiance. The big draw-back is the parking."
0,"YUCK! I ordered general Tsos, Mongolian beef and hot and sour soup. I used to like this place. It tasted like my food was 5days old. It definitely wasn't fresh. The hot and sour soup tasted like dirty muddy water with Siracha added to it to spice it up. The general Tsos chicken was disgusting. It was all breading and no chicken. The sauce they used was gross. My dogs wouldn't eat it. The only thing that was 1/2 decent was the Mongolian beef. It was edible but the beef was gummy. They made Panda Express look like a 5 star restaurant. I really think my food was prepared like several weeks ago and RE heated and served to me. Ughhhh...now I have to search for another Chinese take out place."
0,This place has VERY BAD customer service !!!!! Only positive thing is the food is good. I don't understand why businesses treat their customers that way for delivery.
1,Mark my words you guys have evolved the hot dog. I have had a dodger dog a dog at Fenway in Boston and I think the bread the dog the toppings. You have blown them all away.
0,"Expensive drinks.  Loud.  Themed.  Kinda gross.  \n\nMy real problem with this place is that they do not let you sleep on the floor of the patio, and sometimes when you're in Vegas, that's really all you need.  Not a long nap, but just 3 minutes - power nap.  But no, not at Jimmy Buffet's.  Within seconds there is a team of security around you asking you to take it elsewhere.  \n\nWho wants to go somewhere like that?  Not me."
0,"The customer service in this place is pathetic.  This was my first and last time visiting this coffee shop.  There was no established line or order of anything.  The guy behind the counter was more concerned with his friends who were standing around than taking our drink order.  While the place did seem eclectic, which is always nice for a coffee shop, it also appeared dirty.  I will say that my hot chocolate was very good, but when I got to my car I noticed chocolate syrup all over my fingers....I guess the barista was talking so much that he missed the cup."
1,Our group arrived in Las Vegas at 8:30am and our first stop was BB King's for some breakfast. We'd eaten here (and fallen in love with it) on our last trip.  It was absolutely going to be our first stop on this trip!  I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs- my favorite!  The chicken fried steak is smothered with a country gravy and my eggs were cooked perfectly.  This is def the start of a tradition for us every time we come to Vegas!!
0,Only here because someone else wants boba. This place sounds like a great idea but once I was here eating and say the chef come out of the kitchen and she was picking her teeth & went back to work. Gross. Parking is always a nightmare. The service is always pretty fast so they get two stars
0,Absolutely the most rude manager. I returned a floor power cleaner because when I opened the box the nozzle was full of hair & dirty. The manager said well this has been used. If she would have looked at it she would have realized it came that way. She was very rude to me and finally returned my money. I will NEVER shop there again !
1,"We went for a sit down dinner, and I was completely satisfied with my experience. Ordered the malai kofta and the chicken tikka masala which both tasted very good. The naan was also very good, maybe a little fluffier in shape as opposed to flat like I am used to, but delicious. This is the best indian food I have had in town so far. Also, the interior of the place is beatiful, lit romantically and well decorated. I will go back for the lunch buffet next time. The service was good and we did not have to wait long to get our food. Dinner portions might be small to some people, i thought it was plenty of food though."
0,"$3.99 Deal of the Day, service not included...\n\nI too came in for the Deal of the Day expecting a mob of people, but the place was just over half full.  We were seated at a dirty table in the corner.  Once we placed our simple order (4 burgers, 4 shakes) we waited. And waited. And waited.  The server explained that they were short staffed so I was ready to cut them some slack, but we continued to wait.  It took well over half an hour to receive our food, and we again didn't see our server again until someone else brought our shakes halfway through the meal.  \n\nThought the waiting was finished, but we were wrong.  We didn't see our server, let alone another employee, for quite some time.  All we saw was a near empty dining area that looked like a bomb had been set off, with almost every table in the place covered with dirty shake glasses and various other food debris.  We finally had to go to the other side of the restaurant to inform someone we'd like to pay and leave.  It was almost like it was an inconvenience to them to ask.  \n\nThere was no sense of urgency to any of the \""short staffed\"" employees, if I had paid $4.99 or more for my meal I'd be a little more upset.  We weren't the only ones who left this place disgruntled, it's a miracle this location has remained open this long with this level of customer service..."
1,"It was GREAT! Yes the food was great but what makes me happy with a meal is when the people that work there are happy to have you there, I felt like i was visiting family for a meal. We went around 5:30 pm. and it was not crowded or in other words we didn't have to wait for a table. They even had reading glasses i could borrow because i forgot mine. Our server Clay was great! this was our first time here and we will be back as often as we are in the area."
1,"Great low cost pet clinic! Very clean and friendly atmosphere and I loved the sitting room decor, especially the chalk board doors to the exam rooms!  They also run monthly specials so keep up on those! Awesome!"
0,"I would consider this a huge motel.  Non-smoking room smelled like smoke.  Rooms dark. Beds uncomfortable.  \n\nFine if you are just sleeping and getting the hell out of the room.\n\nWould never stay again unless it was practically free.\n\nAlso, they get one star for being a monorail station stop."
1,Melinda and Rick were awesome. We had no idea what to expect and they provided great service and made the whole process so easy and convenient. The whole thing was very quick and affordable. Would def recommend them to anyone to wants to a smooth process! They are super close to the marriage bureau too!
0,Weird experience! Called and asked for a taxi to the airport. Arrival time to my house 15 min. The woman that answered the phone said they can't guarantee a time. I said ok then I will use a different company. Someone else called me back and said they would be there in 15 min. Keep in mind my house is literally five minutes away so I didn't consider this an unreasonable request. The guy showed up and didn't come up to the house to grab my bags and instead waited for me to bring everything down the drive way. I think that might have been because he had some kind of an issue. He was coughing and spitting phlegm all over the sidewalk. I got dropped off at the terminal but not in front of curb side so again had to drag my bags he didn't bother to take them over. I did make it to the airport in one piece and the fare was reasonable but I am only 15 min away. Can't wait for the city to build additional light rail stops! If I have to drag my bags I would rather do it for a quarter of the cost. Weird weird weird!
1,"I want to start by subtracting the one star because the restaurant was uncomfortably hot - at least where I was seated, it was. I was at the end of the bar practically inside the kitchen. There was a wait, as usual, but as usual, the wait is worth it. I brought a ramen enthusiast friend from out of town. He ordered the tonkatsu shoyu ramen with egg and I ordered the tonkatsu ramen with mustard greens. We also split an order of the pork belly over rice. LET ME TELL YOU. This pork belly over rice was so silky and delicious that I didn't want my ramen anymore. I didn't even need the pork belly. The oils and the flavors of the pork just sinks into the rice and the rice alone is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The ramen is no joke either. The texture of the noodles stays perfect throughout the entire meal. They don't become so bloated with soup that they turn into mush. I hate mushy noodles. My friend ate his entire ramen bowl down to the last drop of soup! Now heed this warning: The portion sizes are not of America! If you think you are going to get this huge bowl of unfinishable noodles and broth, YOU'RE A GLUTTON. The portion size is just right and leaves you with JUST enough room for you to share an appetizer and have a cup of tea. This isn't the type of place for socializing. Eat your noodles and GTFO so that all of the other hopeful patrons can share a piece of the heaven that you have just experienced."
1,"Stopped by for a little staycation. The cosmopolitan is definitely one of my favorite hotels on the strip. Here's why...\n\nPROS:\n+ If the main lobby is busy, they'll open a second registration desk on the 4th floor to check-in. Total check-in time was about 15 minutes from the time I stepped foot in the main lobby to the time I had the keys in hand and headed up to my room.\n+ Balconies, balconies, balconies! Great views of the strip, especially if you're facing the Bellagio or Planet Hollywood. We got stuck facing Aria and it still wasn't a bad view.\n+ Free wifi\n+ No resort fee\n+ Standard room (terrace studio) is spacious and well designed\n+ Large, spacious shower\n+ Staff was very nice\n+ Plenty of parking\n+ Easy to get in and out of the casino from Harmon Ave\n+ Decent room rates w/ my Marriott hook up ($130 for a Sunday night)\n+ Heated pool on 14th floor by the spa\n+ Free lounge act at the Book and Stage (def. not your typical old school Vegas lounge)\n+ Good places to chill and drink and people watch -- Bond and Chandelier\n\nCONS:\n- Several random hairs in the tub and around the bathroom\n- Open bottle of wine in the fridge from previous guest\n- Decent water pressure from the shower, but not great\n\n4.5 Stars"
0,"I agree with some of the gripes written by other yelpers. We went to see Bob Saget last night and it was our first time visiting Stand Up Live. \nThe website mentions that parking is free for the first three hours with validation, and $2/hr after that....but doesn't really elaborate where. We had to make a second loop around the block to find the \""hidden\"" parking garage entrance on 1st Ave. Problem is this is VERY LIMITED PARKING. We made three loops inside looking for spaces. Tip: bring your small car!! Spaces are tiny!\nOnce inside my husband and I were seated in the middle row shoulder to shoulder with other couples, which wasn't so bad as we were next to nice people, but it makes it difficult to get out. Our server was back and forth to the table often, but we did have one drink error which she promptly fixed, and our food went to another table by mistake. So we waited an hour to eat.\nThe comedy was good, acoustics, bathrooms, all good so no complaints there. Good opening act for Bob Saget. \nOur bill was $54 for one veggie burger, two san tan ales, and two vodka rocks. Oh, and if you order vodka on the rocks your bill will say $8 for the vodka, and $2 for the rocks. NO KIDDING. We even asked our server about it. They in fact CHARGED US EXTRA FOR THE ICE IN MY DRINK. \nNo customer finds these unnecessary and frivolous charges fair. It left me with a very negative feeling at the end of the evening."
1,Love the food. Very authentic and high quality. Greg and Miko are fabulous. FIVE STARS!!!
0,"As a first-time homebuyer, the process from start to finish was exciting and stressful all at the same time, with the majority of the stress taking place at the KB Home Design Studio, which this review is for ONLY. \n\nThe sales process was a breeze because my salesperson Gena went every step of the way with me, even continuing to answer home-related questions after I'd closed escrow. Prior to doing so though, I had to make a stop at the design center to select all of my interior options, and that's where the nightmare began. \n\nFirst, the studio is closed on Thursdays and Fridays. In a town where the bulk of jobs are hospitality- and tourism-based, this means a lot of people do not work bankers' hours, so I had to bend over backwards to switch my usual Thursday/Friday days off to find the time to come visit. Considering KB has several neighborhoods for sale, it seemed impractical that these sales offices are open 7 days a week and the one design center that caters to all of them is closed 2 days of the week. \n\nKnowing that I would need to get through the design process as close to one visit as possible, I visited the center before my appointment at Gena's suggestion to familiarize myself with the options and get prepared. She told me an appointment to swing by was not necessary, so I dropped in one afternoon before they closed, making it clear that a) I did not have an appointment, nor b) I did not need assistance, I was merely browsing. \n\nBy the time I got to the flooring section, a gentleman volunteered to help me out with options. Again, I pointed out to him that I did not have an appointment as I didn't want to hassle the staff, but he waved me off, saying I'd have to go through him in my official appointment anyway, so he might as well start explaining now - and for that he is the only reason I gave this place an additional star. While speaking with him, I heard a woman in the back very rudely comment, \""Does she even HAVE an appointment?\"" \n\nIt was just my luck that a few days later this same woman, whose name was Natalie, turned out to be my design consultant. In a process that was already overwhelming as is, she did not help at all, and in my follow up surveys with KB, she was the singular reason why I continued to give KB poor reviews. She did not try to impart any professional wisdom on my interior-design-knowledge-less self at all during my 4 hour appointment with her, merely going through the motions of listing my available options as if reading it off the paper. \n\nThe nail on the coffin came at the end of my session with her when I asked for a list of all the options I had selected, which was just a few minutes before 6p when the studio closed. Natalie gave me the most bullshit response I had ever heard, telling me that she was unable to do so because the report took a long time to generate, and if employees were in the building past 6p, they would \""literally!\"" be locked in. In addition, I was told that if she generated a print out right now, my options would be ordered immediately. WHAT!? \n\nNot more than a few days later, guess what shows up in my inbox - a full PDF of all my selected options, with a message from Natalie asking to please confirm and kindly submit my deposit check to begin the ordering process. Unbelievable. I might not purchase another home with KB, but in the slim chance that I do, I absolutely will not work with Natalie again. She was a true disappointment in this process."
0,"Went  this past weekend with my husband.  Drove all the way from Chandler actually to check this place out.  When we walked in we were expecting some sort of greet.  The bartender was too busy to say hello and it wasn't until another few minutes the server comes up to us and tells us it's self seating. Mind you the manager was on the computer at the bar to busy to acknowledge us as well.  \nWe seat ourselves at one of the tables in the middle. We really wanted to sit at their cozy booth but it had needed to be bussed.  It wasn't until another 10 minutes that I noticed the manager  bussing the table as if she really didn't want to.  Anyway, too late for us to move there...\nOur server was really friendly.  Didn't blink an eye when we just wanted to split some items.  The food came our perfectly.  The fries were hot, salad was nicely dressed, and the burger piping hot.  Food was over the top great.  The fact that I could see the manager's facebook page and ebay shopping while I was dining was a total turnoff. Between updating her status she would help her staff out, but I can tell she did not care about the restaurant.  Never got a thank you or hello/goodbye out of her as we walked on by.\nOverall food was great and our server was friendly, but I will not recommend this place to friends merely b/c of the lack of interest in the place by the manager.  Atleast get an iphone and be discreet about it. don't set up camp at the bar when diners have a full view of what you're doing!"
1,"Went here once for some cider, a $1 taco and to watch a show. Pretty cool joint. Same idea as Casa, but there's wifi so you get the Macbook crowd, and also it's a bit pricier so it leans more towards yuppiedom rather than hipsterdom, if that makes sense. \n\nCool place. I'd go to Cagibi if I wanted a quieter version of what's offered at Casa, basically."
1,"A pretty acceptable Irish Pub for an area lacking in them.  Great selection of beers on tap.  Smithwics, Bass, Harp, Stella, Newcastle, and of course   Guinness.   They've got some pretty good Irish cuisine.  Shepherd's Pie.  Boxty's.  The standard fish n' chips (although the taste is far better then standard).  I've been told the Bangers and Mash is lackluster which is disappointing.  For your classic (i.e., boring) appetite, they have burgers, sandwiches (though the Patty Melt was poor and the Reuben was mediocre), soups, and salads.  \n\nWish the happy hour lasted until 7 as showing up at 6 and missing out on the deals was a little frustrating.  \n\nService was alright.  Not exceptional as the beers took awhile to make it from bar to table.  However, the service isn't going to keep me from going back.\n\nDefinitely a great place to go after work for some drinks, for dinner, or for a nighttime gathering.  Highly recommended for the beer selection and from what I understand (didn't experience it) a good happy hour."
0,"Way too expensive here, charging 2600 and up for a puppy? No thanks, I'll keep looking elsewhere. \n\nSales lady we had was very pushy, kept saying we could finance through them. They have to get commission for selling animals.  She didn't even seem to care what type of environment the puppy would be going to and kept saying that my husky would immediately get along with any puppy.\n\nAlso, saw a dog eat it's own poop in one of the glass windows.  Doesn't seem like they take care of their animals here. Some puppies were sleeping on each other and she just grabbed one of them and said look at this puppy!\n\nVery disappointed, hopefully this place will learn to price more fairly and will take better care of their animals."
0,"Place was pretty empty and service was pretty bad. Even had to clear my own plates on to another table that was not clean, because I hate dishes left in front of me or off to the side when I'm done. Busser saw me and said thank you...lol. My filet was overdone and dry as a bone. Glad I didn't pay for this meal since I was comped. :("
1,"Had the lamb pot, didn't taste like lamb, but with the vegetables and soup it was very delicious.  There is a condiment bar with is a must.  I'll be back, next time I'm in the Land of V."
0,"The fact that I can't even muster any particularly convincing dislike for Prezzo isn't a good sign as far as I'm concerned. It's anodyne pseudo-Italian food served in a non-threatening, tastefully bland environment, for a not unreasonable price.\n\nThe food itself is safe enough - never actively horrible, because it's all kept pretty simple. Everything is a bit overcooked (presumably on the basis that this is less likely to offend than if it were considered undercooked) and the dishes seem to be straight from a British Italian menu of 20 years ago (spicy chicken penne, anyone?).\n\nI had slightly spongy spaghetti, in a lake of runny tomato sauce, with a few overcooked king prawns, side salad and a pot of dressing which (had I used it) would have completely overpowered everything else on the plate.\n\nPizzas are available in various permutations including low-fat, on some sort of non-pizza flatbread, or as something called 'The Executive' (reinforcing the impression that you've fallen through a yuppie time-warp).\n\nThis is the kind of place you might bring your great aunt - the one with the funny tummy, who generally doesn't like foreign food - or book an office Christmas party, after giving up on getting people to agree to something more interesting."
0,Very high prices for very little food. Tana has better food and prices.
0,"Went to TrueRest on Saturday and used a Groupon I had purchased.  \n\nAfter a 5 minute cheesy but kinda funny intro video, the 2 other newbs and myself were shown to a pod room and given a rundown on what to do.  We were then escorted to our rooms.  \n\nI will say that the float itself was kinda interesting.  I imagine if I were floating in the Dead Sea in Israel, it would be similar to floating in the pod.  After my float, I showered up and got dressed, I went to head back to the little oxygen bar area to chill for a little while, partake in a cup of tea and maybe try out the oxygen (for an additional fee).  But the 4 seats they have in that little waiting area were taken.  So I just headed back up to the front, checked out, and left.  \n\nNow according to the website - \""Salt can be corrosive to clothes, but is great for skin and hair.\""  Well it was horrible for my hair (which is thick and curly).  I had to stop by my salon because after my float, my hair was fried.  All of the moisture was robbed from my hair and it was a hot mess.  Even after my hair guy got my hair washed, conditioned and gave me a good dose of Moroccan oil, my hair still feels dry and dull.  I'd hate to say it but, maybe there should be a disclaimer on the website, \""if you have ethnic hair..the salt is going to trash your hair.\""\n\nWith chronic knee (from my surgery in 2011) and shoulder pain, I had hoped this salt float would help alleviate my pain.  My shoulder hurts worse than it did going in, my knee has been creaky, and I've had 2 migraines (I rarely have migraines.  And I drink plenty of water, at least a gallon a day).  So all in all, I've felt like sh*t since my float.  \n\nWould I float again, probably not."
0,"The restaurant was very adorable and the food was quite good, but the service was absolutely aweful. The waitress said but 5 words to us the entire time we were there and what she did say, she said it like she did not care what so ever. In my opinion, good food does not make up for horrible customer service."
1,"I've enjoyed XS each time I've been.\n\nPROS: \n- gambling IN the club! This is great for when you get there early to beat the lines.\n- lots of outdoor seating\n- HOT TUBS to soak your feet after dancing too long in 4+\"" heels\n- beautiful venue\n\nCONS:\n- $$ cover. $20 for girls, $30 guys, even on a SUNDAY.\n- music needs more variety! It sounded like the DJ got bored and had a playlist on repeat. I guess when you're buzzing you don't notice much...\n- CROWDED. Shorties get stepped on :(\n- $$$ drinks (~$20 for \""normal\"" drinks... $105 for 3 Macallan 18s... but that's a separate story ;] )"
1,"I visit Scottsdale a few times a year and have been looking for a great place for massage - I have found it! The environment is professional, clean and calming and my therapist, Warren, was fabulous. I have chronic back issues and he did a wonderful job - he listened to my issues and massaged accordingly...ahhh...I also made appointments for my daughter and husband, and when scheduling, the receptionist asked thorough questions to ensure that we would all be matched up with the right therapist. I will be back during this visit to Scottsdale and in the future!"
1,"Finally, a major ethnic supermarket in the Arcadia section of Thomas. This El Super is spacious, very clean, has lots of regular supermarket items as well as an abundance of Hispanic food items, at prices that are of no stress on the pocketbook. Comparisons to the Ranch Markets are inevitable, so here's my take on it: while large and spacious, this El Super is a bit smaller than a Ranch Market (no sit-in dining area), but cleaner, less confusing, and less crowded - at least for now, and there's no problem with parking even at peak hours. And I just have to add this ... yummy cakes at the bakery section, especially my fave: tres leches  - a delight for this aficionado of simple baked goodies."
0,"FINALLY, a place for hipster wannabes from Assfucklandia to circle jerk!!!  It's ABOUT FUCKING TIME I was able to overspend for a drink and mingle with douchenozzles in ascots and Morrissey glasses...what took you so long, downtown Vegas?! Is there any way I can get a punchcard -- mortgage your house 10 times to buy drinks, get one percentage point free? Where do I sign up?????\n\nI'm on the fence about all this downtown boosterism, but on the whole, progress is good... so I went in to support the new local bar. Sure, it SCREAMS douchetown from the outside...but I did go in with an open mind, I swear.\n\nI bit my tongue while navigating the thug mooks manning the velvet rope out front (!). I bit it again when I shelled out $10 for a drink that costs 1/3 that right across the street. But after hanging out at this place for 3 hours, I ain't biting it no more.\n\nSo many annoying things about this place. There are these weird sort of security-types loitering around inside who can't/won't answer your simplest questions. The whole fuckin' reason I went here was to check out the upstairs patio, but it was closed. Why? No one knew. I wanted to order one of the hot drinks that are labeled \""upstairs\"" drinks, so wanted to know if they were available though the patio is closed. No one knew. Finally found out from the waitress that they were NOT available, so ordered one of their corny specialty drinks...and it was served incomplete, without the special garnish that is an INTEGRAL PART of the drink. If you're gonna charge exorbitant prices for \""mixology\"" drinks, at least make 'em right!! \n\nThe other annoying aspect is the music -- it's so LOUD! My vocal chords were seriously strained after spending a couple hours here, trying to chat with my date. And that was before the DJ even started up!\n\nSpeaking of the DJ, he was the only cool thing about this joint. I expected a douchey hipster type, but he turned out to be an awesomely frumpy older dude with a beer gut, Coke-bottle glasses and stringy, balding hair. He looked more like a children's party clown/secret child molester than your average DJ, and for that I give him MAJOR props.\n\nI actually do genuinely love this bar.......because it keeps all the pretentious assholes in one place, so I don't have to deal with them elsewhere on Fremont St.  So enjoy that $10 jizz fizz, asswad -- I'll be across the street. I'd rather drink among degenerate bluehairs in a smoke-filled casino bar ANY DAY! Hell, I'd rather drink Thunderbird out of a paper bag in the old Ambassador parking lot with that Santa Claus wino....GUARANTEED to be more fun than shouting til your vocal chords are raw with the stuck-up asswads in Commonwealth!"
0,"I came here with my hubby because I was impressed with the tons of great reviews on yelp so I felt like like it was a for sure thing..\n I was set on ordering the \"" Mexican Shrimp cocktail \"" since I had been craving one for a very long time & figured it would be outstanding since this place was featured on Man vs Food.\n( I moved here a few years ago so I don't know the hot spots for this item )\n I have had MANY mexican shrimp cocktails in my life that were amazing so I didn't even think twice when ordering since its a very easy thing to prepare in comparison with typical Mexican dishes..  Unfortunately I was very disappointed when it arrived. .. its like the cook forgot to put half the amount of shrimp in it!!! It probably had 7 - 8 shrimp in it with barely any avocado either. .it was mostly juice and Pico de Gallo.. ( I ordered the large on too! @ $14+ !!! ) ..VERY SKIMPY!!! I'm not expecting to be over served but I definitely expect a fair amount of shrimp! Out of many many places ive tried this was by far the chinsiest!   The flavor was pretty okay though. .not amazing whatsoever but not bad..It was a very sad night for me since I was really looking forward to finding a place that had great ones.. :(  I highly recommend that people beware of wasting your money on this dish. .\nOn the other hand. ..my husband ordered a combo plate with carne asada tacos , beans and rice and I tried his food and it was delish!  \nI may give this place another try but definitely not the Mexican shrimp cocktail!!!! I'm on a mission to find a place that knows how to make them the right way and is not chinsey with their portion.\n Also....its a restaurant atmosphere,  you are seated and have a waitress,  but NO Chips and salsa brought out to the table :(\nDefinitely another downfall! \nI'll go to Arriba's Mexican restaurant or Garcia's when I want great Mexican food! .. the price range is same and you get fresh hot chips with yummy salsa too!"
0,"Bleh. Not impressed at all. I've had better food at Taco Bell. Okay, maybe not, but I did not have a good experience here. The thing that pissed me off the most? What can't you order a taco plate with different tacos?! They have to be all the same for some strange reason. Wonder if they suffer from the 'just because it's in Summerlin it must be awesome' syndrome. They did have tasty salsas....but you pay for the chips. Not a game killer but chips, c'mon man, it's like not getting bread at an Italian joint. Kinda adds that touch. \nAnd one last gripe, the outside patio, they have these short stools that are impossible to sit in and look classy.  You're straddling these things like your bareback horse riding. Me and the guy at the table next to me looked at each other as we're trying to get comfortable, like, are these things for real??!\n\nRaise the tables, quit trying to look chic and make it comfortable!"
0,"I went here largely because of all the positive reviews on Yelp.  Mistake.  There was nothing terribly wrong with the food or drink, but it was priced on the high side.\n\nThere sushi seemed no better than any other mediocre sushi and was a little expensive. 4.50 and up for nigiri.  A large Sapporo: $7, Large (cheep) Sake: $7.  Many of the rolls are very expensive and covered with mayo -- they call it wasabi sauce, but might as well be mayo.\n\nThe spicy tuna and spicy scallops were not spicy at all.  The waitress mentioned they they have to make them even for people who are very sensitive to spice.  (If you don't like spice, don't order spicy! But here, you can.)\n\nAlso:  What's with the dance music?  Hard to relax with that $hit pulsing away.\n\nBottom line:  expensive, and only mediocre.  We won't be back.  \n\nTry Sushi Kee on Warner/Rural.  The ratings on yelp are only 3.5 stars, but better sushi that this place!"
0,"Fail. FedEx is the worst. Package was supposed to arrive on 12/23 (paid for expedited shipping) but we didn't receive it until 12/27. To make matters worse, we had to go pick it up! FedEx's tracking system said that the package was delivered on 12/23 but there was no indication that delivery was attempted. Next thing we know, there is a missed delivery door tag on 12/26 stating that it was the last attempt! WTF. This is strike 2 this year for FedEx. First they completely lost a package and now this... I'll be using other shipping couriers!"
1,"Hmmmm, this place sure reminds me of True Food Kitchen....why is that?  Could there be some common denominator?  I guess it is different in that it's smaller...and the food is actually good!\n\nAnyways, nothing about the menu would lead me to believe it's an Italian restaurant but I primarily dine here for lunch and maybe they switch to heartier fare for dinner service.  I've had the flank steak 3 times straight which used to come with Kale (excellent) but was recently switched to an arugula and baby beet salad (why did they have to die so young?!) which is even better.\n\nThe place has a nice vibe, is adjacent to BarNorth and everything else Kierland has to offer but it is almost always LOUD.  My only other issue is the small tables and tight seating arrangements.  Don't expect a whole lot of privacy if it's busy b/c the other patrons might as well be on your lap.\n\nOverall though, North is a cool place, good food, good service, and if you order an Arnold Palmer you get the lemonade in a nice little carafe--stay classy North...stay classy."
0,"The salespeople here need a serious lesson in manners. Just because you work where they sell nice clothes does not give you the right to act like a snob and look down on people. It doesn't matter if I am here to drop a few hundred bucks, the women here look at you like you're dirt. I have given this store multiple chances and the service is so awful I would not recommend coming here unless you're ready to throw back some dirty looks. I don't understand how these people got hired and why they haven't been fired but here's a piece of advice...SMILE. Offer help. Don't look and treat people like you're better than them. If you hate your job, quit. You're making people miserable when shopping is supposed to be enjoyable."
1,Fun park. 9 holes but very straight forward. Straight long drives with as many obstacles you would expect in the desert. Funny what they call a par 5 though.
1,"Jimmy John's sells tasty sandwiches. The service is quick, even during the lunch rush. I got a combo with a pickle... and received not a sliver, but a huge, deli-style pickle. Oh, and they deliver, which is nice when you need a sandwich and can't leave the office, or the couch.\n\nAn added bonus is they offer free smells. These are really nice when you're not in the mood to eat, but want something satisfying."

0,"DO NOT BOOK ONLINE. THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY TWICE. The week I was in Vegas they had the computer SYSTEM DOWN TWICE. Plus like many other reviews you see here, when you come home late at night your card key will not let you in the room. My friends and I were charged online via confirmation they could not check so they took our cards charged again, then charged us a third time when our key cards did not work late at night! Do not take this risk. Don't gamble on your place to stay."
1,"I love Ulta. What girl wouldn't? Hair stuff, Makeup stuff and perfume stuff all in one place. Most everything is easy to find. The aisles are wide. The store is bright and roomy. They have great prices. You can also get a great deal if you wait for sales and use coupons. I can't really say much on the staff here as I usually know what I'm looking for but I've never had any problems checking out or returning anything."
1,"This place is basically Roberto's but slightly better IMO. They always hook me up with large portions and tons of stuff on 1 plate for the price -- So far, I've had the carne asada nachos (the star there) and the beef (machaca) plate -- both were good. I have late night cravings for this when I get the munchies -- Stoner Joint"
0,"I have myself to blame for part of this review.  After enjoying one of my top 5 dinners of all time at Monsieur Paul in the French Pavilion of Epcot, I expected authentic French food when we visited La Madeleine during our stopover in Phoenix.  \n\nAfter also visiting France, I have a basic idea of a typical quick lunch in France.  If I order a ham and swiss, I expect a simple ham and swiss with mayo on a baguette, possibly tomatoes if you're lucky.  Well, I was disappointed.  The ham and swiss seemed premade and reheated on a croissant.  There was no evidence of what was in the sandwich on the menu (not even bread) and the lunch rush at an airport does not allow a lot of time to question the menu.  Served with chips, they poured an individual bag of chips onto my plastic plate.  If we're at an aiport, a business should safely assume that this person is on the go.  I would have liked this explained to me so I could opt to just have the bag as it is.\n\nI have also struck out with wine at an airport.  Each white wine I've ordered, including here, was metallic in taste and hard to swallow.  I'm not a wine expert, but I know enough to know that is not good quality for the price paid.  I do not see any reason to try this place again if we find ourselves in the Phoenix airport.  They must have something better."
0,"Was too excited about going on the dinner tour with this company. Unfortunately, we had our original reservation cancelled due to a low turn out. Once we rescheduled, I tried to contact the merchant to confirm & could not get a hold of them.  Their website disappeared, there was no phone number listed & my emails kept getting kicked back.  Currently, I am trying to get my refund from livingsocial....long story short SAVE YOUR TIME & MONEY!"
1,"Went to Vanity on a Thursday night. We were the first to get in the club, no line, no cover thanks to a great hookup (Thanks Gary!!) They had an open bar for an hour or so and we took full advantage. Bartenders were good, take care of them and they'll take care of you. \n\nLoved the go-go dancer's outfits, they had on these tanks with corsets and hotpants (I think?) anyways they were super-hot, don't really remember much of their dancing skills, ha.\n\nSomehow I ended up in the men's room (completely sober btw) thinking that the restrooms were combined. Don't know how this happened, must have been a \""blonde moment\"". Got a few looks and smiles as I exited the stall. Doh! When I finally made it to the ladies room, it was much more impressive than the men's.\n\nWe stayed for a few hours, got nice and toasty and headed out for some chow. Will be back to Vanity :)"
1,"I LOVE this place! I've had dogs and been to vets for the majority of my life and this was THE friendliest place I have ever been to, period. My 11 week old Labradoodle puppy was treated so nicely - from EVERYONE there, even the administrative staff (who have an open reception desk area) pet him and gave him attention - unheard of. He got excited over all the attractive friendly girls there (lol) and spotted a little - they did not bat an eye in cleaning up after him for me. Their genuinely warm demeanor only aided in his demeanor and behavior. They took him back for his nail trim ($10) and were back within a jiffy while he barely yelped and had no visible marks or blood from his trim. \n\nThe vet gave him his shot ($20) after her sharing with me a wealth of info in aiding my decisions to neuter him or not (my first male dog) and about shots plus a myriad of other things. She did a thorough exam of him before the shot at no extra charge. Oh - and speaking of pricing, WOW - just wow. Their prices are cheaper than my last puppy I had over two decades ago! Tell me when you have heard that anywhere before. They have nice benches with cleats for leashes and the whole place was SUPER CLEAN and bright plus it smelled great - did not smell of pets or chemicals. Nice open area with two completely separate dog and cat entrances and staff. A very nice convenient location, easy to find in the Fresh 'N Easy center on the NE corner of Higley & Ray with ample close to the entrance parking. Tremendously affordable pricing - the total with nails and shot is less than my haircut/style. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. This is where Harvey and I will be going from now on. Thanks, Niki :)"
0,"If Terrible's was meant to be a theme location akin to Medieval Times, then this would have be the best hotel experience of my life.  We didn't notice the theme after we figured out the tv would only flicker on/off for every channel, nor did we notice the theme after taking a shower with the worst water pressure ever.  I know low-flow shower heads are supposed to save water, but when you have to stay in the shower twice as long to actually get the water to take off any soap it kinda defeats the purpose (as a bonus the shower head came out at my shoulders).  We began to realize the theme of our weekend when we were abruptly woken up at 9am Saturday morning by a 30 second long piercing alarm that sounded like either the building fire alarm or emergency exit alarm.  This was followed by a 10-15 second reprise just a few minutes later.  Anyone one that goes to Vegas for a weekend knows how sacred those few hours of sleep are to the rest of your visit, we were now fully awake and free to use the above mentioned shower, woo hoo!  \n\nWhen I travel I like to leave the do not disturb sign on my door all day so I can have my room to myself for a few days with no hotel employees moving my stuff around.  When I returned to my room late Saturday night I immediately noticed something was off, one of the beds had been made and the other had had the items on it rearranged.  My towel that was hanging up to dry was now missing and no replacement towels were to be found (I didn't discover this until Sunday morning when I was looking to get ready).  Knowing that someone had apparently not followed my do not disturb request and done just enough in the room to kinda freak me out was definitely what put this experience over the top.  \n\nAnd of course the comical cherry on top was the design of the room, the wall between the sink area and the beds had a frosted piece of glass instead of, well, a wall.  The effect of this was that the bathroom lights would shine brightly through the glass onto the beds, thus defeating the purpose of the wall.  Not a big deal during the day, but very disruptive in the middle of the night.  Normally I would not mention this minor thing, but since it was part of a greater over arching weekend theme of terribleness, I'm making an exception.\n\nI will give the place one star for the beds, very comfortable.  I would recommend paying just a smidge more and staying somewhere that doesn't come off as accidentally ironic.  Just my two cents..."
1,"I approve. The previous review is accurate, I did not feel dirty coming out of this place at 11:30pm with my husband. We will return. The next time I will say \""no thank you\"" when they ask me if I want them to do my head/scalp, because they neglected to say this said scalp massage also encompasses the insides of my ear... so ya, was not a fan of the auricular therapy. Besides that, their shoulders and back massages are to die for. And even though the foot therapy hurt a little due to tender spots on my foot (of course I could have requested lighter pressure and they would have accommodated me happily. They also check in frequently to ensure your comfort level.) I know it is therapeutic in the end so I took it like a woMAN. Five stars because we were able to walk in at 10:30pm and still get a flawless treatment without an appointment. Love that they are organized and reliable."
0,"I used to really like this place but it has gone down hill over the past couple of years.  I tried to order a simple BLT on a bagel  and had to repeat my order 4 times because the lady taking it kept turning around and talking to the staff.  After she finally paid attention to me for more then 5 seconds and put my order in, they guy making the sandwich comes around to verify what she put into the system.  Of course it was wrong so I clarified directly with him that I just wanted a plain BLT on a bagel.  Pretty simple right???  Well, I knew I should have double checked my order before leaving as the BLT was smothered with mustard and the bagel was stale.  Who puts mustard on a BLT?!?  Especially after I gave her my order 4 times and then directly verified it with the guy making it.  Not to mention that the lady behind the counter was touching food with her bare hands and then handling money.  I've noticed the food quality has deteriorated over the past few years but this was the final straw.....I'm officially done with this place."
1,"Good Mexican food, service could be better but always consistant.  I get the same thing every time enchilida and carneasada taco, and never disappointed."
1,"Whenever I want to shop in fresh air or even walk off a meal from Cheesecake Factory this is the place to be! The place is beautifully maintained with just the right combination of unique shops. There's a Starbucks, a Nespresso (inside Sur La Table, the awesome cookware shop), Juicy Couture, Anthropologie, Coach, Crate & Barrel, RA sushi, Cold Stone, Banana Republic, bebe, BCBG, and one of my recently-discovered favorites: Francesca's Collections. It's kind of like Anthropologie, clothing-wise, but a lot cheaper. The main reason I like it, however, is the fabulous array of shiny things and knick-knacks that they have throughout the store in addition to the clothes! Where else can you buy a dress, an intense birthday card, AND a pen that writes in 10 colors???\nAnyway, Kierland is a great place to eat and walk around in. I like how if you're waiting for a table at Cheesecake you can pop into Crate & Barrel to pass the time (I usually end up buying things there too :P). \nI've never had a problem with parking and there are always spots somewhere. The exception would be the holiday season, probably. Lots of really posh cars here! \nScottsdale Quarter is right across the street, which means that once I've had my walking-around-and-shopping-in-a-cute-and-breezy-upscale-small-town fix, I can head over to get my urban-feel fix!"
1,Food is wonderful but staff was very rude!\nI got pastrami it was made perfect!  Tried the original also great! And so was tomato soup
1,"SO DELICIOUS.  Pro tip: lunch ends at 3pm, dinner starts at 3:30pm.  Dinner is about $15 more expensive than lunch.  Go 20 minutes before lunch ends, pay lunch price, eat all the delicious lunch food slowly, take walks, enjoy, save some stomach space.  Then check out what they break out for dinner!\n\nFavorites:\n1. pea truffle oil risotto - creamy & delicious & truffly.\n2. creme brulee - this was a dinner dessert.  VERY rich, but small portions so not overwhelming.\n3. cold seafood: squid ceviche, cocktail shrimp, smoked salmon, creamed herring\n4. pastas both in seafood & italian sections\n5. slices of flank steak - not dry, quite flavorful, cooked medium rare.\n\nThe less goods:\n- big chunks of fish in general I thought were kinda dry and not terribly flavorful\n- cup of thai beef salad was weird and definitely not thai and just vinegary & weird.\n- Indian food at dinner: not as flavorful as Indian food in an indian restaurant\n\nService was great - very friendly and attentive.  Over all, a huge selection of food with a lot of light options, so that you can try a lot of awesome food that you wouldn't normally get to eat without feeling disgustingly full.  Major thumbs up!"
1,"I loved every minute that I spent at this studio. The instructors were great, the staff was friendly, and the training was very challenging. I would recommend Elite to anyone looking to really learn about TKD. This school is amazing. As a student of this studio, I highly recommend this school."
1,"Hmmm.  Let me see.....\nIf the TV series \""Cheers\"" were ever broadcast in Japan, odds are they would need to rename it to \""Miko's\"".   \nEssentially that's what I took away from my first experience here. You take the \""Cheers\"" bar and tack on some of the best \""real\"" Japanese eats you can get without a passport and 'boom', you get Miko's. \nHere is what you can expect on a maiden voyage to Miko's.\n\n1. Miko's is Japanesey (is that a word?).  This is a may seem like a no-brainer but you may notice that there are Japanese people working here.  I know!  Maybe it's me but I have found that many of the Japanese places I have frequented in the past rarely have any Japanese people in their employ.  Cool thing at Miko's is that the owner, Greg, he's Japanese. Miko, his wife?, Japanese. Same goes for the sushi chef and the master preparing the hot foods.  Japanese people serving up Japanese cuisine in a Japanese restaurant? Brilliant!\n\n2. This place is a Mom and Pop joint. Expect to catch Mom and Pop there greeting customers, serving drinks, bussing tables, etc.   On my first visit Greg the owned had me bellied up to the sushi bar and offered me a beer.  I usually get an Asahi but Greg informed me that he had Kirin on tap.  When I asked if the on tap Kirin was better than the Asahi he replied \""You tell me.\"" And he bought me one.  Class act.  The place just has that good vibe that puts you in a good place.  People seem more sociable and on more than one occasion I've been there where an entire bar of strangers suddenly is engaged in conversation and camaraderie. Maybe it's the effect of good food, however I think the great beer and flow of sake has a good bit to do with it as well.\n\n3. Japanese Food.  Miko's is not an all you can eat sushi restaurant.  You'll taste that in the quality of the fish, you'll see it in the preparation of the food.  Got something in mind you don't see on the menu? Ask. The masters behind the counter have been plying their trade for a while now.  You want it, they'll make it.  Great sushi is reason enough to make Miko's your home base for raw fish but the great sushi shares it spotlight with a hot foods menu that is equally impressive.\nSo impressive that I have had great internal struggles to see where my food allegiance lies.  Do I fill up on sushi? Or should I abandon the raw in favor of a \""Pick 3\""? This scenario has occurred more than once. \nMiko's Hot Menu includes the \""Pick\"" menu.  The most popular being the Pick 3.  The combinations are incredible and to vast to list but here is my pick three.\n\nJ-Recca's Pick 3\nFirst Pick : Unagi KabaYaki \nSecond Pick : Hamachi Kama \nThird Pick : Salmon Butter Yaki \n\nSo there ya go.  Miko's. The official haunt of J-Recca. Odds are pretty good if you come late you might catch me at my favorite past time.  Holding up the end of the bar."
1,"I want to have every meal of the day here!\n\nThis was my first experience with Flemings and it won't be my last! \nThe padres and I came here for an early dinner on a Sunday. When we arrived, we had the restaurant to our selves and settled in on our second table (my mom didn't like the first one) which was a comfy horseshoe shaped booth in the corner. I perused the wine list, which is on one of those fancy iPads, and choose a yummy Zinfandel that appeared before me in no time! \n\nI was trying to eat healthy and started with the Fleming's salad (candied walnuts and  cranberries!) and then had the New Bedford Scallops that were perfectly cooked and accompanied with a delicious lemon-honey glaze (my mouth is salavating as I write this). My mom was super boring and I honestly dont remember what she ordered, but she enjoyed it. My Dad, however, loved his dish that they only serve one day a week. On Sunday's they offer a prime rib special that includes a appetizer salad, two sides, and a dessert...you need to come on Sundays. This was one of the best prime ribs he as ever in the 35+ years he has been living in Arizona. For his/my sides he ordered the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and the BLUE CHEESE mashed potatoes! Everything was incredibly tasty and I still had my Dad's dessert to devour! \n\nFor dessert, my Dad ordered the Carrot cake, BUT, my mom mentioned earlier that I was recently engaged and in addition to the carrot cake (which was amazing, the spice was so delicious and the cake itself was incredibly fresh and moist) we got to indulge in the super gooey Chocolate melted volcano cake (I couldn't stop eating the creamy center filled with chocolate sauce and I am NOT a chocolate person), the refreshing Pistachio ice cream with a yummy tuile (that's a fancy name for a buttery walffald/cookie/cone, thanks Andrea for helping me with my \""classy\"" lessons), and, my favorite, the light, yet dense creme brulle...ugh, so good! Oh, and since they knew I was watching my figure, we also got to try their house made whipped cream that you could eat as a dessert on its own!\n\nThe food was fantastic and the serivce...more fantastical (even when the restaurant started to fell up)! From the friendly hostess who greeted us, to Adam, the server's assistant, to the BEST WAITRESS EVER, Andrea, and even the manager, Jessica, all were extremely friendly and really seemed to care about how our dining experience turned out. \n\nFive stars all the way!"
1,"If it wasn't so expensive, I'd hightail it back yonder. Great portions for just one person (for God's sake, it was big enough for you to be full for supper and have a reasonable lunch for the next day)!"
0,"I actually like the coffee here. We just moved into the region and are so sick of Starbucks, so we started occasionally going here. I realize their holiday drinks are better. They had a promo going that we were planning on all week - now I understand we made an error in the times of the promo, but we walked in a few minutes after the promo time thinking we were still almost an hour early - the shift supervisor could not wait to announce we were to late while he ran to the sign and ripped it down in front of us. I guess I had misinterpreted the date as the hour - yes my error, but it was only a few minutes after the hour. His rudeness did it in for me. I may go back in the am and see how the store manager responds, but if it is more of the same it will be my last evening visit, and maybe my last visit. CUSTOMER SERVICE counts people - I guess I need to stick to Dutch Brothers where they go out of the way to make you feel welcome and glad you came!"
1,"Beautiful and impressive building, inside and out, worth visiting for itself. Main auditorium not ideal for chamber recital - de Silva's piano managed to fill the hall but from first row of dress circle Perlman's musicality & virtuosity was often drowned out. Big shame."
0,"How embarrassing . My wife purchased an iTunes gift card for a birthday present and when my niece  tried to use it, it had already been redeemed. So we called target and they actually weren't gonna help us with a refund because the sticker had been removed. So how is someone going to know if a gift card is gonna have any value to it without peeling the sticker out, WOW!!!! They wanted us to call apple to have it clarified, but what a hassle. Finally the manager took care of it after being on hold for so long on the phone with apple."
0,"Have tried Enso several times.  Each time, awful service!!!  Beyond the rudest and most inept servers in all my dining experience.  Overall staff is rude.  \n\nI love paying $200 for a meal, only to be treated rudely.  Additionally, the bathrooms were the worst I have experienced (and I travel to Newark NJ for work people). Literally smelled like vomit, only 2 stalls for all the women, no toilet paper, so dirty that I literally was nauseated from the smell and this was after paying $200 for a meal!!!  If you are going to charge that price, clean your bathrooms please!  It was like a dirty skank club after 3 am...just horrendous!  \n\nWith the awful service, rude staff and horribly unclean bathrooms, I would highly recommend anyone with class and wanting to enjoy a decent meal, conversation and night out....STAY FAR FAR AWAY from ENSO.  It appears they have forgotten whom the customer is and have become skank club central.   So beyond dirty, I honestly worry if the food is prepped in an area as unclean as the bathroom."
1,5 Stars. So well deserved. They have things together. Amazing selection and wonderful tasting food. Amazing ambiance and a friendly staff.
0,"I came here for dinner, and like what many other reviewers said, you get what you pay for here. \n\nThe casino has a lot of advertising that boasts all you can eat prime rib and etc. After paying and getting seated for dinner I saw that prime rib is the only thing people were standing in line for at the service stations - and with GOOD reason. \n\nThe bf grabbed some sushi which I was too scared to try. I touched the rice with my finger and it was a sticky, rubber like consistency - a sign of bad rice. I didn't even want to try that. \n\nI grabbed some mashed potatoes, prime rib, sweet yams with marshmallow and bean soup. Everything except for the prime rib has the consistency of mush as it had been sitting on the hot plate for a long time. The bean soup tasted really terrible and left an aftertaste in my mouth. \n\nThe prime rib was the only attraction here as the meat was juicy and decent for the price paid for the buffet. People were like vultures waiting for the prime rib and I had two people cut in front of me as we were waiting for it to come out of the oven. It's obvious that people come here to eat plates and plates of this meat. \n\nSave up some money and pay for a better buffet elsewhere."
0,Not a very good dinning experience if you plan on sitting anywhere other than a Teppanyaki station. I've visited this place 2 times in the last year.During our last visit we sat at the bar thinking we could get a quick meal and drink. We where mistaken!! We ordered 3 sushi rols and a fillet. Our food came out in 45 minutes and getting a drink in this place was like pulling teeth. I will not return.
0,Service today lacks...took a good 10 minutes for my iced drink....had only 2 of us in there and 3 employees....
1,We had to go.  This was on my kids list of things to do.  They loved the 3d m&m movie. Which is free.  They loved picking out some gifts for friends.  you can find anything M&M here.
0,I've been using Priceline for 8 years almost on a weekly basis. Every once in a while I run across a hotel that treats you like a second class citizen. This is one. They are nearly empty and won't put me in a king room without a $50 up charge.  My room is next to the elevator too.  Why us Priceline if you're going to resent all your customers.
1,Double Yoke is a hidden gem inside town center lounge. Great Food and service. \nSpecial thanks to Igs for supporting Lone Mountain White Sox.
1,"Even though this place doesnt compare to the chinese hotpot places in cali, it cured my hotpot cravings! Definitely one of the better ones in vegas!\n\nEach hotpot is fit to serve one person with spiciness ranging from 0 (mild) to 5 (hot). There is a \""sauce bar\"" in the back where you can pick and choose your own dipping sauces: garlic oil, chive oil, chinese bbq, garlic oil, and also has cilantro, & green onions. \n\nI ordered the chicken hotpot and for whatever reason, you can't pick the level of spiciness for the chicken hotpot but you can ask for the spicy sauce on the side and mix it in yourself. \n\nThe soup itself is really soothing and tastes very healthy. You can see the goji berries and jujube floating in the soup. It also had chunks of chicken, mushrooms, cabbage, and other vegetables. It was plenty for me but you can also order more on the side if its not enough.\n\nDefinitely will be coming back as the weather gets colder!"
0,"We had a groupon for this place and he did not honor it. Apparently they didn't go through the trouble of actually preparing for the amount of people that would come for the groupon, so they just didn't bother with trying. So we didn't even get to eat here, but from what I saw the food looked average and the place was fairly dirty. This place doesn't deserve the one star yelp forces me to give them."
0,"I was extremely unimpressed with the service at Octopus.  I paid around $50 for a interior detail only to find my back seats still dirty after leaving.  I know that I could have taken it back within a couple days with the receipt, but I was on my way out of town after the car wash and didn't have time for that.  Really, I expected it to be done nicely the first time.  I'm so sad that I paid this much for what I received. Also, I found the customer service at the  cash register to be really unfriendly."
0,"I have bought three laptops within the the last 3 months and each time I have gone into Best Buy in hopes of getting service like they used to give way back when.    I assume they have decreased their staff over the years to help their bottom line.   When I have gone in there, you cannot find a sales person to help you in the computer department.   Once you do get someone, they are short and rushed and do not know the details of the technology.  They have became nothing more than a sales person.      Several years ago, Best Buy was the place to go as they would educate you on the purchase and you would leave there feeling like you at least made an informed decision.     Needless to say they are no longer training their employees on the details.     I ended up taking my three laptop purchase to FRY's because I could get my questions answered!"
0,"We live around the corner, we have tried this place now over a dozen times and it just gets worse.  Food? OVERPRICED! We have tried several items, pizza(is that what is was?) burger (pressed cardboard) between soggy buns.  Service if you can get it is awful.  Stopped in several sundays ago, not 10 people in the place moslty staff behind the bar, sat there for 15 minutes while they nlooked at me, had ot ask for service, order a marg and sandwich, 20 minutes later still have neither bar tender went back and started talking to her co-workers rather than do her job, I left!.  Managment there needs to wake up or be discharged, evident they are clueless"
1,"I love this place.  It's a hole in the wall, but the food is really good.  The fried rice was excellent.  My young son loved it.  I love the wonton soup and all their stir-fried noodle.  The portions were generous and the price was reasonable."
1,"My boyfriend and I have been looking forward to trying Cure since it opened, and it definitely met our expectations at dinner last Friday night.  Cure has got it all figured out: food, service, and ambiance.  \n\nWhen we entered the restaurant at 6:30, we noticed that all of the tables were full (except ours), yet it didn't seem overcrowded.  The tables weren't too close together; we didn't feel like we had to whisper so as not to disturb the neighboring tables.  \n\nWe had the Salumi appetizer (I don't eat meat, but that mustard was unlike anything I've ever had!).  I'd also highly recommend the heirloom tomato appetizer (watermelon, basil, white balsamic foam, pine nut brittle, goat cheese, and fennel pollen).  I had the trout as my entree, and I can't say enough good things about it.  It was light and not at all greasy, and the creamy almond aioli paired perfectly with it.  \n\nNice touches:\n-Corkage fee is CHEAP!\n-The chalkboard lists all of the local farms that Justin buys from...It even notes what he buys from each farm.  Loved the heirloom tomatoes?  Now you know where to buy them.\n-Michael Pollan books in the women's bathroom :)\n-Justin, the chef and owner, seems like a truly nice guy.  He was smiling and talking to customers, and he didn't seem to have that suuuper cocky attitude that head chefs tend to have.\n-#13 out of 50 best new restaurants in the COUNTRY according to Bon Appetit magazine... enough said!"
1,"Great local bar - yet on the main drag in South Side.  The wings are my favorite in the burgh.  Actually, all of there food is good (I still need to try a fresh gyro from here).  The service is awesome.  They make you feel at home.  Also, it would be hard to find lower prices for drinks on Carson.  The only negative I have is smoking is still allowed in the bar area.  Most of the time you cannot tell, but occasionally it's annoying for a nonsmoker."
0,"Okay...let me start by saying I am shocked at how many people gave this place a good review. \n\nI will be generous and start by saying some of the positives. Food was fresh... I would even call it tasty. It had a good atmosphere with a lot of potential. \nHowever, everything was over priced, portions were on the lighter side, and the service was TERRIBLE. It took between 8-10 min just to order drinks. The waitress acted as if she'd never had a table in her life. The kids menu was on receipt paper.....and when ordered the kids cheese crisp...there was nothing crisp about it.  When we were getting near the end of our meal, the bus boy came and started collecting things as if we weren't there. He started to take things that we weren't done with and when we told him we weren't done, he looked annoyed and disgusted. \n\nThis place was beyond dissapointing."
1,"Oh, Veterans Park. How you so lovingly sit quietly along Central Ave with so many amenities. Not many people know of how accessible and resourceful this little Plaza Midwood assett truly is. \n\nStomp the break, the entrance comes up quickly, and pull up the long drive into the abundant parking lot. There are several tennis courts open for public use that stay lit into the evening hours. Get your game face on, shave that McEnroe mustache and grab your racket. Some experienced players show up to these courts on a daily basis. \n\nThis facility is perfect for an afternoon pickup game of softball/baseball, basketball or bocce. Also, many mountain bikers can be seen riding throughout the small wooded area and more open fields. \n\nBring the kiddos, too. There's a fantastic playground and, dare I say, a fantastic covered water fountain pavilion. Don't have kids? Pshh. Even the adults will have fun. Jets of water spraying out of the ground make for laughable memories and beat the heat like your mama didn't know. \n\nThere are plenty of trees to sit under and get in an afternoon of reading with your current literary treasure as well. \n\nI love this park and miss frequenting several times a week. One of the more quiet parks in town and is worth a visit!"
1,"We really enjoyed lunch here...it was pretty late in the afternoon and there were still plenty of people eating. Lunch menu was a deal: both of us ate for $14!  We never asked for anything, they were on top of drinks and such. The marinara is AWESOME.  And you get plenty of food for the money. \n\nWe passed up BT Burger Joint, Fuel Pizza, TGIFridays, Just Fresh and others to drive to Lake Wylie for lunch here. We'll be heading back when in the area."
0,"We all have things in our lives that we gravitate towards when it comes to comfort food depending on your mood and frame of mind at the time ....mine is I love Wings .....all kinds.. all shapes and sizes ..Mmmmmmm......wait ....what was I talking about ....oh yeah wings...but yep I love the Sweet Hot type and Jammin Jalapeno are my absolutely must have's..!! Now with that said ............................\nSadly..... Buffalo Wild Wings (at this location) is borderline Good.... it's only getting 2 stars because it takes friggen forever and the value for what you get vs cost is high in my opinion. I know what your thinking how can I make such a crazy statement like this one. Well its because I have spent many, many Car Club meetings most Sundays here and the average time for just 4 to 5 people that are eating something is about 45 minuets.!!..crazy right ..You would think OMG we have 15 or more people in our party ..nope only we average 7 maybe 8 at times but even then our wait times where around 25 minuets at the longest so whats changed ?? I know your probably thinking well its slammed and their backed up right ! Nope on average where there at around 3 to 3:30 pm and the place has always been way less than half full every time at best.( I'm really a glass is half full kinda guy ). so why the long times to get your food I still don't know. Anyway I'm really not trying to slam this place because its supposed to be about the food right ?? On a positive side when we did get the food its always hot and usually correct without a hitch.. So yes its Good just not the wow factor and when you add in the time it takes with the cost vs value ...sorry guys ...2 stars this time ... I'm sure I'll try it again hoping for a better result's next round...again...."
1,"Boy, was I surprised.  I've had thai food in many major metropolitan areas, and this ranked right up there with the best.  Outstanding food, and the condiments tray had 4 items that were all extremely flavorful.  (And pretty spicy)\n\nWish I lived closer.  This is a great restaurant."
1,Superb - you must all visit! Very friendly and above all - authentic - great beer too :-)
1,"I was comped here for a weekend and made full usage bringing the boys with me.  Saw some fights, lost some money but all in all a great time as always on the strip.  \n\nThere's nothing I can add to these reviews really, high end facilities and located north center of the strip.  \n\nIt's one off my bucket list to stay and play a round here as well.  We had a suite over looking wynn's 18 holes and I dreamt of the day where I could afford to play a round and stay at the wynn on a single trip.  Now that would make me feel all grown up.  Great hotel."
1,"I just went to my first show at the Mesa Arts Center, in the Ikeda Theatre. It is a beautiful venue with great acoustics. It clearly a great mix of technology and architectural style. I was very impressed. What is best to me is that it wasn't elbow to elbow with pretentious types of people which you would expect to be herded with in these types of venues. \nThis is clearly a place to see great musicians and artists. \nThe grounds and classrooms are very nice to walk and observe on a cool October evening. Look to see what they have coming, and go out and enjoy."
0,What happened? It used to be so good! I think the Keirland location is better. The Vegas rolls seemed pre made and reheated. Service is hit or miss. The last server really slow when they weren't even busy.
1,"3.75---my nephew and I went to eat. He loves pizza. Place was fairly busy, we were seated right away. Ordered a small pepperoni and the server recommended four seasons. Came out quicker than expected. The four seasons had prosciutto, tomato, black olives, artichokes, and mushrooms. It was 2 pieces with prosciutto-tomato, prosciutto-black olives, and so on. It was surprisingly good, two things though: place is pricey (40 for us two) and the crust was too soggy. It didn't hold the ingredients well but was very good otherwise. Would definitely give it another shot."
0,"The entire staff in exceptionally rude. The representatives they send are always late, grumpy and overall not helpful. STAY away from this company. Avoid at all costs."
1,"My friends and I like to come here for the old school arcade games. They have a huge selection of games on two levels. We go crazy competitive on the basketball hoop game and I must also brag that I can beat anyone in Mortal Kombat. \n\nIt's no Six Flags, but it serves its purpose. Fun little rides for some entertainment that bring us back to our childhood."
1,A great place for a Friday night fish dinner. The baked fish is my favorite.  The prices are very reasonable with good drink specials. The wait staff is very friendly. Ask for the hash browns with cheese and onions and you won't be disappointed.  They can accommodate large groups and are willing to make special orders.  Give them a try and you will walk away satisfied.
1,"The restaurant was recommended to me by the chef at Digestif. He told me to come here and get the corned beef hash. So I did, and it was excellent. I had never had corned beef hash before and I was glad I tried it. It is definitely not the healthiest meal you can have, but it was a nice change. \n\nThe person I went with got the garlic and mushroom omelet. It had a thick sherry sauce covering the eggs. The sauce looked similar to gravy, which might sound weird for breakfast, but it was amazing! I have never had anything like it at all for breakfast. This sauce would be great for dinner too, with chicken or some other type of meat. \n\nIt was definitely a very filling meal, but both dishes were very good and I would suggest giving this place a try."
0,"Wait. Wait some more. I hope it's worth the wait. Still waiting. The hostesses have attitudes, why? So hungry. Still waiting. Glare from hostess. Wait. Was that my stomach making that noise? Wait some more. Do I hear the theme song to Jeopardy in my head?  Finally, our table is ready! \n\nI am starving, so I will let the rude hostesses slide, lets do this! I order the Vegan Burger, which I know you are now thinking to yourself, what a dumb veggie head and you will now discount my whole review....... Well here it is. It was just meh and I have had better. All the veggies were grilled but the whole thing was so greasy that I had to use a fork to eat it. What didn't help it was the side of fries that were cold. So looking back on my evening, I should have just stuck to ordering a milkshake and possibly that would have turned this into a three star review, maybe."
0,This place is way under seasoned.  The beans were ok.  I hate that they use store bought tortillas.  I don't plan on returning.  There are better places near downtown Chandler.
1,"What's better than a red beer and people watching?\nI think locals appreciate this more, because I was entertained four a couple hours watching everyone roaming by.\n\nGood bar food and a few great bartenders."
0,"Me and a couple of friends went for lunch and there was not as much food out as there should have been, once the food had ran out the staff never put more out like they should have, the food was cold and the staff were not very friendly."
1,"I give Thai Me Up five stars because it is a Pittsburgh staple to me.   Whether it be lunch or dinner  I am a huge fan of this place.  Lunch is awesome and they have a great special (which other reviewers have mentioned) and I like that it is a tiny restaurant with no frills.  It makes it an easy go to when you just want something casual that you know will always be great. \n\nI love dinner here because it is BYOB with a minimal corking fee.  I always get the Spicy Basil Noodles or the Pineapple Curry.   It is great, cheap, Thai food that doesn't disappoint"
0,The service is terrible. Asked for water and was told they were all being washed. How about using any of the serval types of glasses that  you have at the bar to serve a party of 6 with water. You had no problem bringing cocktails and beer instead of water. \nWas there two different nights because it was right next to the movie theater. Well never ever go back.
0,"The service was awful. Not rude, just inept and scarce. (Had to tell the bartender how to make a margarita.) The restaurant was empty (6:30pm on a Thursday) except for us and one other table, but I still had to flag the server down every time we needed something. The food was good, but not any better than the owners' kabob shack in Dilworth, and twice as expensive. If you want to try it, better hurry before they close, which is inevitable. They seem really over it..."

1,"The Buffet at Wynn is one of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas! I really like their colorfully decorated entrance; it's very whimsical! The tables are arranged with a lot of space in between and they are located not too far from the food.\n\nI like the wide selection that they have here. Usually when there is a large selection, it is usually in exchange for the quality and taste. That does not apply to The Buffet at Wynn though--all of the food is delicious! I have tried their premixed salads and I have created my own salads and they were all very crispy and fresh. The had about four different soups and I tried the clam chowder. It was very creamy and hit the spot for me, especially after a night of drinking. I tried a lot of their entrees, which included grilled chicken, pasta, sashimi, prime rib, king crab legs, pizza, and I think I should stop here before you think I am a fatty. But oh, they also had a very large selection of desserts and fruits too!\n\nIt cost about $40/person, which is pretty standard for Las Vegas buffets. I can't really say much about the staff, because the only time we were waited on was when we ordered our drinks at the beginning of our meal. I recommend coming here if you're looking for a good buffet in Las Vegas!"
0,The staff here is very nice there is just never enough of them. This is not a single occurrence. I was third in line this morning and from the time I walked in until I walked out it was 13 minutes.
1,"I loved my meal here at Mastioni's. I did a seafood pasta with a vodka style sauce and came with my mom who was in town from FL.  She did a more garlic, oil type seafood pasta.  Both were awesome.  Dress nice, place is nice but doesn't break the bank."
1,"I feel like family at this place!  I have been going to this salon since it opened.  I love the staff and find they are all exceptionally talented. Although I typically see Ramon, when my schedule has changed unexpectedly, I've been seen both Wendy and Christina.  I always feel welcome and look forward my appointments.  My color always looks great.  I trust them to help me look my best and to tell me the truth when I am considering a choice that will make me look like a goofball.\n\nIn addtion, the salon is very community oriented.  They assist local non-profits with donations, provision of services and volunteer time.  The owner often helps his clients who are undergoing chemotherapy on days the salon is closed to ensure privacy.\n\nI have been recommending this salon to friends and family for years and can't imagine going anywhere else.  \n\nRock on Ramon, Wendy & Christina!"
0,"Food was good for the most part besides the onion rings that were cooked way too much. Service on the other hand was a joke. The 3 waitress' in there we're complete air heads. We'd ask for something & every single one of them forgot & turned around to do something else. There was one other table in there mind you. Our waitress didn't even know what I was talking about \""free doughnuts\"" for checking in. Smh\nThe owners were in there & weren't friendly whatsoever.\nWe drove all the way from boulder city & we will NOT be back.\n$73 for 5 burgers(not including tip) & 3 of us didn't even get a soft drink.\nNot impressed whatsoever. If you've seen the show & want to try it, I wouldn't if I was you!"
0,"Pros:\nAtmosphere is hoping, nice views, open late\n\nCons:\nFood was mediocre and is essentially overpriced bar food.\n\nThe complimentary pretzels were a nice surprise. Started with a pitcher of the sangria, it was good not great, and the walnut shrimp appetizer. For $18 I expected to get some tasty walnut encrusted shrimp. Instead, we received a bunch of overcooked shrimp in a sweet cream sauce with MAYBE 6 walnut bits tossed on top of the bowl. Truly a terrible appetizer.\n\nFor dinner my wife and I split the Orange Beef. $26. It was really good, but even in Vegas I wouldn't say the value was there. I was also surprised at how it was prepared. The medallions of beef were rather large and very rare. I was pretty happy about this but I could see a lot of people ordering and it being too rare for their tastes.\n\nIn any other city I'd give it 3 stars and move along, but in Vegas with the plethora of great dining options here, I don't think the value is anywhere close to what you pay for. Overpriced average food, with a few gems on the menu that keep people coming back."
1,"I'm going to preface this review by saying I thought I didn't like tacos or Mexican food in general. Now I know I just didn't like bad/subpar tacos. Which shouldn't surprise anyone since I tend to be drawn to the finer things in life but that's a discussion for another day. The crazy thing is this place is cheap, I would easily pay more for what we order. \n\nMy favorites are the carne asado vampiro which can be described as a crispy grilled taco. The barbacoa taco with all it's accompaniments and the mexican corn. It's bad for my waistline so I usually convince someone to share it with me. \nThe burrito- hands down the best I have ever had. \n\nI love the location, music and overall vibe of the place."
1,"Great place for vegans and non-vegans. Prices are reasonable, the guy that helped us today was super nice. Definitely going back again and again :) Food is fresh and delicious... just wish they served breakfast still (then it would be 5 stars)."
1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Everything is perfect. Food is awesome, staff and service is great. I prefer HnJ over BC. Only down part about it is the parking! A +++ for Hot N Juicy!"
1,It's good for beginners
0,"My recommendation: water\n\nWe ordered buffalo wings and loaded potato skins as a \""hold me over\"" food because nothing else in PHX airport looked open, but I'm not quite sure what we got.  The buffalo wings were chicken tenders coated with a really thin layer of really acrid/burn your mouth off buffalo sauce, and the potato skins were loaded with...oil.\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy something from a vending machine if you're hungry.  Totally not worth the $30 that we spent here for two dishes + tax/tip...not even CLOSE."
0,"Not very impressed at all.  Gone there twice this past week.  Should not of given them a second chance.  Got the dozen bagel deal the first time and more than half the bagels were hard, thinking that the bagels were more than day old.  The next time we went for bagel breakfast sandwiches.  Got 3 az classics.  If it weren't for being hungry and not wanting to waste the sandwiches we would of thrown them away after the first bite.  The eggs are literally mush in your mouth, thinking that they use powder eggs.  The sandwiches had a lack of flavor.  Will not being going back or recommending it to anyone."
0,"Recently left this gym after being here for almost a year.  The place is really dirty.  The locker room is smelly and machines are not wiped down by staff throughout the day.  The club rules are only for some people to follow, the others (like the obnoxious business men bunch in the morning who stand on equipment and shout back and forth to their friends and leave their gym bags all over the floor) dont have to follow the rules.  Staff is more worried about working out themselves or standing around on their cell phones instead of wiping down equipment or greeting customers.  Before you got a raggedy hand towel when you checked in, according to a recent email you are now required to bring your own sweat towel!!! Are you kidding me? Equipment will also be out of order for sometime before its repaired.  Do yourself a favor and skip this place."
1,"So I love ChopShop in Scottsdale so naturally I had to try the Tempe one. First off the Tempe has a lot better set up in my opinion. It's an old house right on ASU campus with a giant patio with games and a fireplace. They have a \""life size chess\"" outside which is favorite part. \n\nSo I always get the beach bum protein shake when I'm there but I switched it up and got the jacked up PB + J. It's basically taste just like strawberry and peanut butter. It's good but not sure if I would order it again. \n\nFor my meal I got the chicken protein bowl. If your like me, I try to eat healthy but if it doesn't taste good I won't eat it... This is why ChopShop is always so packed. It's healthier cuisine that is amazing. My chicken bowl is just veggies, chicken, and rice. (I switch out the rice for sweet photo hash). If your in Tempe or Scottsdale this is the perfect lunch spot"

1,Went to Pho with my kids.  HUGE bowl!!!  It was really good.  Also tried the fried calamari and Pad Thai.  Both were really good.  I love their Pad Thai!  Definitely a do again!
1,I agree about this place being a wonderful spot for a special occasion. The food is amazing and the view can't be beat. The service is excellent. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the pricey menu. I understand that this is a very nice restaurant and the prices reflect that but they have a policy of making you pay for a side dish which runs about $10. This is the second time I went with only one other person. The side dish they give is a large quantity which is too much for 2 people. If you don't pay for a side dish it only comes with a salad and the fish. It just feels wrong to charge so much for a plate of vegetables. If they want to charge for a side dish how about the option of a medium or large portion or charge what you really have to for the meal. It just takes something away from the experience to feel like you are getting ripped off to charge so much for a plate of vegetables.

1,"It was a nice surprise when we found out that they have lunch special! Bento box with teriyaki salmon and 4 pieces of sashimi priced at $19, super delicious! My friend ordered unagi donburi and it was to die for, sweet and melt in your mouth eel! Service was excellent! I recommend to go during lunch time if you come to town with kids, it was nice, quite and still great food and service!"
0,"Interesting, not once when you were here did you mention it needed to be relocated indoors.  Your recommendation for repair was to simply raise the water heater off the ground and drill holes in the bottom pan to allow for better draining.  Searching for any reason possible to support your poor service after the fact is in no way going to change people's impressions of your capabilities.  \n\nThis is even more alarming that you point out in the owner's manual by Bradford White, which I had present when you were out, a solution that is different than your own assessment at the time of the service call.  This shows you make rushed, uneducated decisions on repairs in lieu of taking the time to research the specific appliance, the manufacturer's recommendations, and the correct repair.  \n\nMoreover, your recommended repair was to drill holes in the unit which would have voided the manufacturer's warranty and obviously not been the correct repair as no unit should need to be physically customized such as that to properly work.  \n\nLastly, you point out that relocating the unit inside would have fixed my issues.  To clarify, this was the first and only time I had an issue with the water heater and it has worked fine every day since I took 10 minutes to fix it as I originally quoted.  It has rained like cats and dogs many times since you were out with no drainage / operational issues.  \n\nI strongly suggest you take some courses or professional counseling in customer service, effective communication, have some sort of safety checklist or other process by which you can ensure you take the right precautions when entering and leaving job sites due to your lack of detail or knowledge creating potentially very dangerous situations as addressed in my original review, root cause analysis of systems failure / triage, and acceptable repairs within both manufacturer and the National Fuel Gas Code guidelines [in the case of gas integrated systems].  \n\nFor now, all prospective customers should look elsewhere for better service and prices.  It's not worth saving $50 on a repair that causes even more damage or puts you and your family at risk nor paying much more for a repair when the proposed resolution is more extensive and incorrect; no saving there.  Plenty of better options in the valley."

1,"In reponse to some of the 1-star reviews on here for this place:  Yikes, people.  It is a croissant!\n\nMy brother-in-law has been picking up pastries from here for the whole fam for years.  He was our \""designated pastry driver\"" so none of us had any idea what this place looked like or where it was.\n\nYesterday after a walk at Kiwanis my husband and I stopped in.  This place was SLAMMING!  But they are efficient and move you through in a polite but, \""Pick or get out of line\"" manner.  If it takes you more than 20 seconds to pick a croissant flavor/filling, you can stand back and let others choose - sorry!\n\nThe decor was a bit... odd but I don't eat at breakfast places for the atmosphere.  Breakfast places are busy when they should be - at breakfast time - and I just go there to eat and get out.  If you want to lounge and savor every bite, go to dinner or go get a pre-packaged something from a coffee chain and sit all day.\n\nI LOVED that we got there before what seemed to be the 10:15 rush.  We got the last of each of our croissants and they were DELISH!  I had V8 from the cooler and DH had OJ, so I can't comment on their coffee/espresso drinks.\n\nGo in expecting New York politeness and have your mouth watering for a crisp-on-the-outside-delicious-on-the-inside croissant and you will be happy!"
1,"Went on a Saturday night at about 11PM. Very chill spot. Got the AYCS ( All you can smoke) for $13. What more can you say about this place?\n\n- Smoke as much as you want\n- Nice vibes\n- Nice setting\n- Nice service\n- A DJ to hold it down for you\n\nThe only con I would say is that they don't have a strong enough AC. Easily fixable but still need to penalize them for that. Otherwise, I can see myself coming back here."
0,We went here to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary primarily on the reputation of the owner - Todd English. Poor choice. Seated in the bar although we requested outdoor seating. Had bar patrons standing over us while dining. Management no where to be found. Server was attentive but spacing between courses was poor. Left to have dessert elsewhere due to length of time to be served and the crowded bar environment.
1,"We love this restaurant.  The staff is professional, friendly and efficient.  We have always had great service.  The food is really very, very good.  It is fresh, and prepared with pride.  The atmosphere is lively and can be a little noisy. It is not a large restaurant and so when full can feel a little tight, but it all adds to the fun.   \nWe visit this place often and it has become a family favorite.  They have a great wine list!  We love this little restaurant and their staff.  \nCliff and Cathi"
1,Flying solo.  It's a burger joint.  Plain and simple.  Small menu with the basics.  But the basics are so good.   Great burger.  Juicy.  Cooked just right.  Would love to come back.
0,"The price is definitely very good for a buffet on the strip, but the reasons behind the low price are:\n* mediocre food quality \n* very limited selection (can be a good thing though)\n* utter lack of care from any of the staff (a lot the stations had nobody replenishing the foods - therefore a lot of empty stations when there were on 10-20 customers in the entire buffet) \n\nVery good beef stroganoff though."
1,"Having been a little disappointed in our go-to burger joint near Shadyside during our last few visits, we came to the Burgatory, and it far exceeded my expectations. We started with the truffle oil and gorgonzola fries - AMAZING. I also started with the Burnt Almond Torte shake since I love Prantl's Burnt Almont Torte. This was very good as well. As my entre, I tried the Phat Patti's Vegie burger. Between the fries and the shake I was pretty full at this point so I didn't eat much, but I enjoyed what I had. As you can probably guess, the shakes are filling so if you plan to get one, come hungry or consider passing on the appetizer (although I know I will never be able to pass on the truffle fries).\n\nMy one complaint is that there was way too much whipped cream on the shake (the whipped cream took up 1/3 of the glass), but it came with a \""refill\"" cup so there was still plenty of shake to drink if you could make it through the whipped cream."
0,"10 minutes... nobody acknowledges I'm here.  It's 1:45 and the restaurant isn't that busy, 2 servers, both of which pass me several times, and no greeting... no menu... no water... just flat out ignored.  Other patrons started to notice I was being ignored, even after hand gestures to get attention.\n\nWhen the server's casual conversation started with the adjacent table I had to get up and just leave.  Unbelievable."
1,Best prime rib and lobster I have ever had! Excellent customer service. I will definitely coming back .
1,"We love this place. Great donuts.  We recently was in and ordered the egg, bacon, cheese bagel breakfast sandwich. Oh my was that good.  Always a hit bringing these donuts into the kids classroom."
1,"Make sure a tour will be available when you go, otherwise you won't be able to enter the nationality rooms (especially on the weekend).  This is an amazing space.  I can't imagine being able to stroll here to do my studying!  I was totally enchanted."
1,"Lovely yummy hidden treasure in our neighborhood.....  \nSoooooooo good.  The smell is incredible, so many choices, and healthy choices, and cooked to order.  Treat yourself early in the morning and start your day in spectacular way!!!!  We love it here...  Good spot for the grandkids too."
1,Visiting Charlotte and found this place. LOVE IT.
1,"A great little fruit and veggie mart! I ducked in to pick up a few odds and ends I needed on my way by, lured in by the inexpensive produce, and was delighted to see how clean and tidy (and simple!) this store is. Smaller than some giant deps, there is produce, some grocery items, cheeses, meats, breads and some nuts and assorted other prepackaged bulk type items.  They have some really nice sausages, that were a bonus (I had only intended to pick up some produce). The staff are really friendly. I'll have to remember to stop here the next time I'm in the area and in need of some groceries."
1,"I love Theresa, Lawrence, Elizabeth and Christy! They are all truly amazing at their artistry! I look forward to going to @Lash The Lounge not just for treatments, but for the friendly, welcoming, warm atmosphere. My eyelashes are simply amazing...Theresa and Lawrence are both exceptionally talented in their craft. They are so meticulous and I always walk away feeling so great. Elizabeth does a great job with manis and pedis using the amazing Dazzle Dry product! How great to be able to walk away in minutes without worrying about chipping, smearing, or scratching off your polish - and it stays for weeks! Christy waxed my eyebrows and I don't think I have ever had anyone take so much time or be so patient and gentle when doing so. They looked the best ever! This is just one fun, energetic, happening, friendly place where you walk in the door and walk out feeling like a million bucks! All I can say is...AWESOME!"
1,"I took a chance here my first night in Charlotte and had an awesome experience. Great atmosphere with a beautiful, romantic interior. I think it's a reliable restaurant if you're ever in the area and up for good food at good value. The flavors are complimentary and meals are also sizable. I think the staff could have been a bit more welcoming but my friends and the food made the experience for me so I would come back."
0,"Fine Food - Poor Service (this time) Each time we dine here it is a different experience, that is not always a good thing. \n\nWe started with the minestrone soup ($12.00) the vegetables were not over-cooked (I love that), and kale salad ($13.00) - light dressing, like a Greek salad but with kale - black olives, cheese, tomatoes, very fresh.\n\nEnded with a vegetarian (primavera) pizza for $14.00, cooked perfectly. The problem was not in the food it was the service, took a while to order our drinks, brought the wrong ones, could nit get refills, the first course finally came, them they did not clear our plates for 25 minutes, finally the pizza came, after we reminded them, and asked a third time for refills. \n\nThen had to ask another sever to get our bill be cayuse our server disappeared (for 10 minutes), he came back into view and took an order for a party of 10. We realize things can get crazy but there are others that can help out. Stay out of the middle tables, they seem to be the \""runway\"" to others and we were forgotten along with the table next to us.\n\nWould dine again, just at another table."
1,"Used to live here when it was owned by a different company. They used to have weekly wine & cheese nights hosted at the clubhouse and most people in the office were very friendly. The community was very outgoing and many of us are still good friends even though we moved out (bought a house).\n\nSince we left, the property has been under new ownership and I've heard some negative things about. Hopefully they will bring back the weekly wine nights. In general, the new staff does not seem as warm and welcoming as the old staff.\n\nAmenities are nice and they offer fully furnished apartments. The option for a garage was also a big plus for us!\n\nDon't pay your rent with your credit card unless you want a $25 service fee. Paying with a direct deposit from your bank account is free :-)"
0,"It really does pain me to rate Sunrise so poorly, as they are one of the few decent restaurants in Maricopa. TWICE now my wife has found a hair in her salad. Hairs in food are not all that uncommon in the restaurant industry, but it always leads me to the question, \""If they're skimping on the hair nets, what other practices are they overlooking?\"" Washed hands? Clean cooking utensils? It's just bad form. We ordered the Monte Cristo and mozzarella sticks in addition to the salad. Both tasted like the oil for frying needed to be replaced. The Monte was so bad we sent it back and left. The service was good as always but the food was SO disappointing. I love their breakfast burritos but they won't be getting our business for a very long time."
1,"This store reminds me of the numerous record stores in Philadelphia. The walls and floors are packed with all kinds of records.  It amazes me that they can even keep track of their inventory. I think that while this place deserves recognition, it also has a few overly priced records. \n\nIt's easy to kill a few hours here just trying out and listening to random records. You may find something you like! They range from having everything as strange as Japanese country music to modern alternative bands. \n\nThe selection of this store surpasses any record store that I've been to in the 'burgh so far."
0,Arrived this Friday at 3:00pm. Check in took over an hour! Had private dinner party at Carlos and charlies for 60 family members. Came in for reservation to not have anywhere to sit. Our party was all separated then told we could not be accommodated for drinks because there was only one assigned waitress. The whole dinner was paid weeks in advance. Horrible service and rude waitress.  We then met a man who worked here that offers us 20$ unlimited drink bracelet which he told us they get paid for every one they give out. We then came in to after dinner club with 20 people and paid our 20$ fees.5 minutes later we were told we had to leave (no refunds) because they claim one person who walked in with our group caused a scene 2 days ago which didn't happen. So we payed thousands of dollars and got treated like total shit. Will never come here again. Worst vegas hotel service I've ever seen.
0,"Well, if you've only got 10 minutes and desperately want something that resembles BBQ i guess this might be the place. However, a strong argument can be made that you'd just be better off with a McRib.\nI got a half rack with frozen fried okra and cole slaw fresh out of the tub. The three sauces I tried were sickly sweet but you'll want sauce 'cause the meat just doesn't bring much to the table. \n\nThat's about all I can say about it.\n\nDid I mention they were fast? They're really, really fast. Faster than McDonald's so you might want to consider that in your decision making."
1,"I could not be happier with the permanent roof that was built over my deck by the guys at Extreme decks. The job was completed quickly and the results were better than I expected. The guys went out of their way to work with the inspector and meet the stringent expectations for our township. They even helped us out with some extras we asked for including putting up an outdoor tv and building a large wooden gate to match our deck in order to keep our toddler contained. Unlike other contractors we have used, I would highly recommend Extreme decks for all of your outdoor living space needs."
1,"The best place for a Filet in Las Vegas. We also had the Sea Bass, it was fantastic. The spinach salad and the au gratin potatoes were equally delicious. The service was wonderful, just a few reasons why this place is one of my favorites!"
1,"What can you say... It's Applebees. If you don't set your expectations too high you probably won't be disappointed. The service during my visit was prompt and pleasant. The cheeseburger sliders were good; they were no White Castle but then, nothing is. All in all, nothing to complain about."
1,"Who doesn't love a slice of warm, greasy, cheesy, goodness at 3am?\n\nLate night study session, putting the finishing touches on a major presentation, hard night of clubbing, end of a 24 hour session of hard core grinding on the green felt.  You crave it.  You gotta have it.  Once you do, you're smiling and loving life.\n\nThat said Secret Pizza is more about the experience than food.  Decent New York style thin crust with a good balance of quality ingredients.  Tasty sausage, good quality cheeses, ripe acidic tomatoes.  Generous toppings but not overloaded.  Never too out there combos (ie,  CPK).  \n\nIs it the best pie in the US?  NO.  Not even the best in Vegas.  \n\nInexpensive for the Strip (less than $5 a slice).  You get to play the cool, adventurer as you seek out it's goodness (exactly what the Cosmo is all about).  The best part, you can take your slice and eat it while walking through the casino and watch the envious drool.  One of them might even ask you where you got it.  The answer is obvious, \""it's a secret\"".\n\nSometimes, to experience the adventure is more important than the food.\n\nRecommended."
1,"We were served quickly.  Got soup, a slice and a beer - it was the perfect lunch for a blustery day.  Plus their lunch time deal is for a soft drink, but our server counted the beers as our soft drinks which was a pleasant surprise.  I was diggin' the Michael Jackson on the stereo as well.  Seeing that this place is about fifty feet from my house I know I'll be back."
0,"Regardless of the day or time, it's the slowest Starbucks in town. Nice people but terribly disorganized."
1,"After attending the Yelp Elite event \""Cheesy Does It\"" at Luigi's, I vowed to return as soon as possible so that I could dig a little deeper into their menu.\n\nPart of my project team demanded pizza for lunch today, so I suggested we order Luigi's. Very few of them had heard of the place (zero, actually), but all were eager to give it a try.\n\nOnline ordering was a breeze; the Chow Now service was incredibly easy to use. I registered, ordered, paid, and received confirmation all in less than 5 minutes. Wow!\n\nThe next pleasant surprise came via email - Luigi's said, \""Your order will be ready in 20 minutes.\"" Holy cats, that was fast! Delivery isn't available over the lunch hour, so I raced over to Midvale as quickly as I could. I arrived exactly 20 minutes after receiving the notification and guess what? The entire order was ready and waiting. Friendly staff handed me the order and thanked me for the business.\n\nI drove back to the office and shared the bounty. \n\nCheese bread, with roasted red pepper, garlic, bacon, and bleu cheese was excellent. Slightly salty but oh so flavorful. Bread got a little soft during the 20 minute drive, but that's my fault, not Luigi's. Folks devoured this in no time.\n\nThe margherita pizza was simply awesome. The crust was so perfect - about as thick as a \""thick\"" saltine cracker, chewy yet crispy, and bursting with yeasty flavor. Toppings were fresh and flavorful; the house made mozzarella was firm and incredible. This was my favorite, believe it or not.\n\nThe Bada Bing boasted white sauce, bacon, asparagus, fontina, caramelized onions, and mushrooms. The crust was once again superb; the entire pie was delicious. I could only grab one slice before it was gone.\n\nThe Truffle featured white sauce, mushrooms, fontina, mozzarella and truffle oil. Aside from making my car smell like a million dollars, this pie received the most compliments from my fellow team members. They thought it was unique, bursting with flavor, and they loved the savory aroma. I agreed. \n\nI think I've found my new \""go to\"" place for pizza. Finally! Yay Luigi's!!!"
1,"This place is the only place I've found in Phoenix where I can get a champurrado fix.  And they've got great loaded hot dogs, too.  The owners are very sweet and attentive, and they'll bend over backwards to make sure you've got everything you need, particularly if you're getting your dogs to go.  Who knew parking lot food could be so great?"
1,"Came at prime time on Friday night. Was a bit of a wait, but not excessive. The king crab appetizer was enough to serve as an entree. It came with microgreens and summer squash, and was worth the $19 price tag. We also had a side of steamed tricolor cauliflower with ponzu sauce-worth the 3 bucks, but so much more could have been done with this. The roasted corn and poblano soup was outstanding.  Try the fruit pie and gelato for dessert.  I will probably try short ribs next time I come.  Jody, our server was top notch. \""Howie Burger\"" with the gruyere cheese and caramelized onions was good combination per friend's report.  Aside from the burger, all the items we ordered were from the small featured menu, which generally features local seasonal ingredients. \nIt's noisy inside, so pick somewhere else if you want an intimate romantic dinner.  There is a back patio if outside dining is a realistic option."
0,"I am not done with Thai Rama.  Enough people, even close friends whose judgment I normally trust, have had good experiences there.  After about a half dozen times, I have been universally disappointed.  Granted, I have only eaten in one time, maybe they just have take-out issues, but I don't believe that to be the problem.  The Pad Thai is bizarrely sweet, like almost some sort of off-brand honey BBQ.  That isn't exactly the flavor, but that is what it made me think of.  Everything else, both Green and Yellow curries, as well as assorted rice and vegetable dishes just tasted bland and like they were using second-tier produce.  Maybe I just need to pull the ideal dish from the other yelper favorites, but until then, Thai Rama is significantly sub-par in my book."

0,"Sigh... where do I begin with this place.  First off the service was appallingly bad.  I mean bad like we sit down... wait... wait... drink orders ( a coffee and two waters), wait... wait... 8 minutes goes by then my coffee shows up.  No water.  Really?  I had to flag down someone just to get some water.  FALE!\n\nFood was moderate.  I had the spinach pesto with chicken.  It seemed like something was a bit off in how it was cooked and presented but the taste was ok.  Chicken was dry but still edible.  My friend got the salad and that looked much better and was much larger than I expected.\n\nThen when it came time to pay we got to play the waiting game again.  I literally saw some guy at another table get equally fed up and hunt down the waiter so he could pay.  Yes... it was that bad.\n\nTo sum it up:  If you have places you need to be in a timely manner, avoid this place as time obviously doesn't apply to the wait staff here.  Food was average but nothing to write home about.  Overall I say skip this joint for food and find another place in Cesars... I know you can do better."
1,"This was probably the nicest UHaul truck I've ever rented.  Every other time, the truck looks like a beast from the '80s with a thirst reserved for those travelling across the Sahara.\n\nThe only thing that lost a star here was the gas miser on the other end of the counter.  I always thought they left the gas needle somewhere between full and empty so as to confuse the next renter on trying to figure out how much gas to put in it to get it back exactly where it was when they return it.\n\nNot sure if this was unique to this UHaul location or all UHaul locations, but on the gas print out, it showed where the needle was and how much gas to put in it to get the needle back to that point at various locations along the gas gauge.  Spiffy!  Of course, later I would find that this was only spiffy in theory.\n\nUpon returning the truck, I stopped off at the local gas station, looked at my gauge, looked at the sheet....5.1 gallons.  Easy enough.  I proceed to pump about 5.25 gallons into the tank...just to be on the safe side.  Well the needle got up to about that mark but slightly under but I figured no big deal.  Well, as it turns out, it was a big deal.\n\nSo I got dinged for missing a gallon of gas and was promptly charged $9 bucks.  Awesome.  And I know that had I returned it with a gallon of extra gas I would not have received a $9 credit on my bill.\n\nOverall, it was one of the better UHaul experiences I've had and next time I'll be sure to just put an extra gallon or two over what the estimator thinks."
0,"There is nothing more frustrating than taking your pet to the vet because you think something is wrong with him, and having the vet completely ignore everything you tell her. This is why I do not take my dogs to Alta Vista anymore. \n\nI took my older dog to Alta Vista after we adopted him because it was close, and I had a free exam certificate from the shelter. The vet seemed nice enough, and I'll give her a pass on the fact that she clearly had no idea what breeds he might be (she told us he'd get 50 pounds, max, when full grown today, he's 70). \n\nSo, figuring that they were ok from the first visit, I took him in when he started having issues. Vet #1 \""thought\"" he might have bladder crystals, and sent him home with expensive prescription food and an order to come back in 4 weeks. \n\nVet #2, on the return visit, completely disregarded everything that had been written in my dog's chart as well as everything I told her, and wanted to run a bunch of expensive tests. Vet #1 had told me he'd just need a retest for the crystals, Vet #2 wanted to send him through the ringer. No thanks. \n\nWe got the hell out of there as fast as we could manage. I don't do doctors who don't listen. She may have the degree, but I live with the dog and know what he is and isn't doing. \n\nNeedless to say, we haven't been back. And my dog? He's perfectly fine."
1,"So while perusing Beckett's Table FB post, I had noticed their menu and decided to check it out. After looking over it with a fine tooth comb, I realized their Brussel Sprout dish was missing. I immediately commented about it on FB and said how sad I was that it was no longer a menu option. Fast forward a few days later and they posted They're BACK!!!! Woohoo!!! I was so excited. I mean me, excited over Brussel Sprouts. Yes indeed!!! \n\nFast forward to last night, after the Yelp Help's event. I figured since I was in the neighborhood, I might as well stop on over to have my fill.  I got there, scored a fabulous parking spot, and propped my booty up at the bar. Before he could even ask what I wanted to drink I blurted out Brussel Sprouts. Poor guy. I knew he wanted to laugh but instead he was like ok.. I will get that in for you but would you like something to drink? I giggled and declined since I had been to a wine making event before the Yelp Event (busy night)\n\nFast forward what seemed like 5 mins and bam, my brussel sprouts were in front of me. The waiter that served them to me even asked if I had called them in because they were ready so fast. I said nah, but maybe someone in the back heard me when I blurted out Brussel Sprouts? lol. OMG they were so delicious. Crispy pancetta, little crispy burnt (in a good way) brussel sprouts. I was in vegetable heaven.\n\nI chatted it up with another bar patron, paid my bill and was out the door in maybe 30 mins flat. I really did just come in for some yummy Brussel Sprouts. What can you say, its an addiction! I will definitely  be back again as long as they are on the menu :)"
0,"I have gone to this club in the past and have enjoyed the experience.   I recently decided to revisit this club and had a bad experience .  I saw a dancer that caught my eye. I offered her a drink and a dance. After her canoodling me  I gave in and said i'll take  one ( 30 dollar)  dance.\n\nAfter some pleasant conversation over the drink( I treated her to),  the dance began .  After four minutes the song was over and I reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip, when she explained I actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs.  By my count it was one dance. Apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well.   I thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35. This  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil. She called her manager and made me out to be some kind of lunatic lowlife cheapskate.   I politely explained the situation to the  manager but he insisted i pay up which i promptly did .  After wards i made a quick exit.   \n\nThere was no mistaken that I was being blatantly scammed here.  I was in the club for less then 10 minutes and hadn't even finished my first beer, and was not drunk in the least.   Unless you don't mind being scammed by a dancer, and paying 60 dollars for a 4 minute dance I would  steer clear from this establishment .  A night I was hoping to relax over a beer and a beautiful dancer cost me 80 dollars for less then 10 minutes of harassment and aggravation.  It appears to be a pretty good club and i couldn't say if they regularly scam the patrons,  but  they sure as hell scammed me.  On principle I'll avoid this place  and I'll tell my friends to go elsewhere as well. The are  a ton of clubs in the area with gorgeous girls  that even have signs on the table that you will never pay for a dancer's time or for  her simply talking to you.\n\nYou've  been warned .\n\nJay"
0,"The new Big Chicken is a Big disaster. It also seemed like a corner of my sandwich did not make it into the deep fryer. I ended up cutting the thing into pieces and tossing it on the stove with some other stuff. This was the Bacon Swiss, it was supposed to be extra crunchy and dusted with spices, but neither occurred. The tomato slice was of course an end piece and the bun had so much mayo it was a soggy, gooey mess. One half of the bun got tossed. It was $4.99 and maybe it is just this location, but might give it one more shot somewhere else, but doubtful. Late night craving fail."

0,"Room was nice enough for the price, but the sheer amount of confusing, erratic, and ultimately erroneous charges to our room account not only left my girlfriend's bank balance destitute, but in overdraft.  A complete lack of disclosure, poor excuses from the management, and an absence of resolution followed.  Wi-Fi is also ridiculously overpriced.\n\nMuch like Vegas, the Plaza is a gamble, and the house always wins.  Will not stay here again."

My massage therapist was Corinne, who was absolutely wonderful. I really enjoyed my experience and plan to be returning soon."
1,"I shared a kale salad, the goat cheese raviolis and a medicine man elixir. The medicine man was pretty good but the kale salad was unbelievable. I've never eaten kale that fresh and that light. The raviolis just kind of melted in my mouth. If you're vegetarian and you live in Phoenix, hit this place up."
1,"I think I have found my new favorite breakfast place in Vegas!\n\nI was staying at the Palazzo and was given a coupon for 15% off at Bouchon.  I was hungry on Saturday morning and did not want to travel too far, so Bouchon it is.\n\nI really enjoyed the decor and the relaxed yet elegant atmosphere.  \n\nThey drop off fresh French bread to your table that is served with butter and homemade jam.  I am not a fan of jam, but my boyfriend couldn't get enough of it.  I was already sold on this place drinking fresh squeezed OJ and eating the bread.\n\n\nMy boyfriend had the Breakfast Americaine, and I ordered the chicken and waffles.\n\nThis is no Roscoe's chicken and waffles; it's MUCH MUCH better.\n\nThe chicken was roasted and came with a delicious sauce.  The waffles had bacon and chives, which sounded questionable, but totally worked with this dish.  It was accompanied by warm maple syrup and Tahitian vanilla butter.  YUMMMMMMMMMMM\n\n\nI am definitely making this a staple for every Vegas trip."
0,"Quote spoken upon grabbing a seat at the bar; \""Uhhhh...when I go out to a greasy spoon place for breakfast, I don't actually want to SEE grease on my spoon!\""\n\nThis place is filthy. Dirty, dirty, dirty! \n\nCouldn't even finish half of my breakfast for fear of what kind of dirt and grime,(bugs!) were lurking in the areas of the kitchen that I couldn't see. I am by no means a germo-phobe but, I could not get over the filth of the dining area, what I saw behind the counter, and the kitchen sight lines. A little elbow grease combined with soap, water and sanitizer could go a long way! I just can't understand how this place wins Madison best of polls, routinely. Too bad, I was hoping this could be my neighborhood breakfast place, it will not be!"
1,"Stayed here for 3 nights last week and I have no complaints. Short distance between parking lot and your actual room, that's always a plus. I love how big Vegas hotels are, but sometimes after a long day of walking on the Strip you don't really want to walk another 30 min from your car to your room. \n\nStandard rooms are a little on the small side but that's not a problem for me. Why do you need all that floor space anyway? (Cough cough, Venetian) Front desk was very nice and polite; she waved our first night's resort fee because we got there super late at night. \n\nThe only thing I dislike is their location. The hotel is a bit more South than the hotels I usually stay at, and that means further distance from hotels such as Bellagio and Caesar's Palace. For a more centralized location on the Strip, you're better off staying at Paris or Planet Hollywood.\n\nAs far as dining options, NYNY has everything from quick bites like Nathan's hot dogs to an upscale restaurant like Gallagher's Steakhouse. We had a $35 dining credit and used it at their Irish pub, Nine Fine Irishmen. Pretty much ate for (almost) free. Overall, can't beat this hotel for the value. I had a free night from myVegas, got the other two nights from an Expedia deal, so I stayed for three nights for under $200, that's including resort fee. I'm definitely coming back!"
1,"Very Good Greek food with a nice family atmosphere.  I get a sense this place is family owned by the hospitality and time they take to explain the menu.  Diner like atmosphere, outdoor seating and very clean.  \nThis very well may be the best restaurant (not just Greek) in Goodyear."
1,"Looking for some quick & cheap dinner I went to the burger lab for the first time. Didn't know what to expect  but the owner was really friendly and the service was great. While I was waiting for my food he fried me up some fresh chips with salsa which were really good. \n\nI got the cheesesteak burger for my sandwich.  It was covered with saut\u00e9ed onions, peppers and cheezewhiz. Pretty freakin good burger. I will definitely be coming back here with friends.  They also offered me free scoop of ice cream too which was pretty generous. Overall just really attentive service and good food"
1,Not to shabby.  Went on a Saturday night.  They had a half rack rib special with 2 sides for 12.99.  This was totally worth it.  I ate every bite.  Ribs fell off the bone.  The sauce is where it's at.  Nuff said.
0,"This is going to be brutal.  Hide the children.\n\nIf you've been to Chipotle, you'll feel right at home at Qdoba. That is, until you start eating. Complete and utter ripoff of the concept, except for the part that matters - the execution.  Where Chipotle succeeds, Qdoba fails miserably.  The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier.  The burritos are just plain bad..  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat - basically the opposite of what you'll get at the \""other\"" place.  On top of that, the rice and beans were the suck.  And if you know Brak, you know that he LOVES his beans.  But not these.  About all they're good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crap.\n\nIf you want to know the root cause of this debacle, check out who the parent company is - it's Jack In The Crack\u00ae.  Pretty much explains it all.\n\nAvoid at all costs.  Receives Brak's dreaded zero-star review, rounded up to 1 because Yelp doesn't allow a zero."
1,"I stopped on way home to pick up dinner yesterday after a pretty bad day. Bought tortillas, and quarts of hot sauce, green chile, machaca and beans. I had everything in a box. As I went to put everything in my truck, it all spilled in the parking lot. Instead of crying, I went inside to ask for something to clean up the mess I created. They cleaned up the mess and replaced all of the food I dropped without charging me. They did not have to do this and I was very grateful since it was my mistake. Not only is their food some of the best Mexican food in town, their staff and management are awesome. Thank you CAROLINA'S for making my day!!!!!"
1,"Truthfully, I didn't think I was going to enjoy my visit to tourneau. I guess I wasn't expecting too much. Also, I didn't think I was going to make a purchase when I walked in. LOL All I knew was that I wanted this brand of watch but didn't know what it entailed, price, etc. \n\nWalking in was alright, two young girls--first look would be like \""their just looking, no biggie\"". We got a few smiles from their associates acknowledging us, but no one to really answer questions and what not. Until, I decided ask and try one. The person that helped us was JOSE. Jose was wonderful! He helped us with answering questions, explaining everything throughly with how special the watches were, and trying to help me figure out what was good for me. My friend and I were very impressed. After learning more, I was more intrigued into getting one! Then whoa, the prices came lol. Jose reminded me that a purchase this big should be a memorable one. Not something rushed. (I really respected that as a customer!) He also added that financing was available to make this purchase more possible!  Than BAM, the watch was sold. Jose made the experience of buying this watch more than just buying it. \n\nThank you so much jose!"

0,"Ok so I'm actually a big fan of this place; great happy hour and food is mostly good. So we won a visa giftcard of $100 and decided to celebrate at this yardhouse earlier...everything from the food, drinks, and service was going great until the bill came of $160. Ok so we explained to the waitress to charge $100 on the card and the rest will just be cash of $80 which the change would be her tip...she comes back to us saying the card wouldn't go through because ''giftcards like this takes out a percentage,'' so she claimed she tried swiping $95, $90, $85, and finally the amount of $80 went through. She also said it took out an extra $12 as the ''percentage that goes to the back to the bank.'' we made sure to ask if that $12 goes to her and she said \""NO.\"" ok nothing seems to make sense, so I called customer service and they told us that the reason why the amount didn't go through BECAUSE they charged the amount of $115, $113, $110 (so obviously it wouldn't go through BECAUSE the card only contains $100!!!) and that extra $12 was charged as a gratuity for the restaurant, it doesn't go back to the bank merchant...So this waitress PRETTY MUCH LIED to our face not realizing we won't call the customer service of the card!!! They obviously keep track of every single swipe and was able to tell us what amount they charged us. She purposely charged more than $100 into making us think that it won't go through and charged that extra $12 for tip but lying that it doesn't go to her so we can give her more money...that is just plain SHADY! are u freaking kidding me? Why would she lie like that? Has other waiters here done this as their way to pocket more tips? It's not about the amount that gets me, it's this dishonesty that really boggles my mind! It was such a disappointment because she was accommodating but forget that when you're dishonest! Normally patrons would have made a fuss over this but I'm not like that, we just left but I would like to talk to a manager about this tomorrow because that's just wrong. We were willing to give her 25% tip but we're not as stupid as she thought we were so we left. She still got that $12 though so whatever."
1,"I've only ordered from here, but have done it about 5 times now. The language barrier with the people who take your order over the phone makes it pretty difficult, but if you can get past that the Mongolian Beef is sooo worth it! I love that stuff! Its spicy and the grilled onions are amazing. I didn't even know I liked onions that much! \nBut the eggrolls are greasy and just taste bad. I don't think you should have to cover them in sweet and sour sauce to make them good. Also one time I had the Kung Pao chicken and it wasn't even kind of special. I was bored with it and halfway into it looking for somethng else to eat. \n\nI don't know, maybe I shouldn't give this place such a good review then, but the rice and mongolian beef make me love getting food from here"
1,"My parents have gone to Ganem for years and when I moved to Arizona, so did I.  even though we live in east Mesa, it is worth the drive!  The service has been excellent going over and above.  Jason, the Co-owner, is always helpful. He designed a couple of my moms rings incorporating some gems she already owned (and thus had sentimental value as well).  They jewelry turned out beautifully.... Maintaining the past and yet beautiful and uptodate. Luckily, they will get passed down. :). We could not recommend them more."
0,"I am sorry, I have no idea where the other reviewers on here have eaten Italian before, but this was the worst I have ever tasted in my life. I will get straight to the point--the food:\n\nAppetizer- Fried Calamari- The large photo next to this appetizer in the menu shows rings and tentacles with what looks like a nice, light breading...BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY SERVE! The waiter brings us a plate of the thickest tubes of calamari I have ever seen and NO tentacles whatsoever. The breading was not light at all, but extremely thick. The meat inside was very chewy and the marinara had no flavor. \n\nSalads- Ceasar: Huge, limp pieces of romaine lettuce with bagged shredded parmesan cheese, soggy croutons, and a side of bottled Caesar dressing. They do not even dress their caesar salad!\n               House: Brown, water-logged iceberg lettuce with a translucent piece of tomato that was half-frozen, soggy croutons, and bagged shredded mozzarella. The italian dressing had been in that ramekin for weeks because it was congealed to the point where it wouldn't even pour out. I really wanted a salad, but I couldn't bring myself to eat even a bite.\n\nEntrees: Veal Marsala- Imagine salisbury steak with mushrooms and some cheap marsala wine thrown on top...\n\n                Chicken Parmesan- Chewy, tough chicken, soggy breading, the same flavorless marinara from the calamari, and bagged mozzarella melted on top. If I was starving I could eat it...maybe. \n\nSide- Sauteed vegetables- Microwaved green beans, cauliflower, and round carrots that were very overdone and then drenched in butter.\n\nChid's meal- Chicken fingers and fries- Heavily breaded chicken fingers and shoestring fries. The fries were actually my favorite thing out of it all!\n\nAll in all, I will never go back. I wish I hadn't gotten my hopes up for quality Italian when I saw the reviews. I don't usually like chains, but Charlotte is making me look at Carraba's and On the Border in a whole new way ever sine since I moved here. In my opinion, the private restaurants are so BAD except for a very select couple of places, but they are nowhere near Matthews. This was by far the worst, however."
1,"Barnes and Nobel is a Great Family Place to read and grab a cold drink.\n\nBarnes and Nobel is a good place for current titles. The staff is always helpful, friendly and courteous.

1,Such a great spot! Everything is so fresh and made to order. The food is to die for and I wish we had more of these kind of restaurants around!
0,"Never again. Let me repeat, never again. \n\nThe primary reason I used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.\n\nWalking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy \""guilty-until-proven guilty\"" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.\n\nThe pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.  They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy.  I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for.\n\nThe first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers.  i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card.  After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer.  I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior.  When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up \""maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.\""  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.\n\nThe latest of many \""adventures\"" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill.  We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow.  Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up.  I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription.  But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment.  \n\nWe then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior.  We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us.  After searching around for a few minutes, they \""found\"" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.  Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared.  Hence, I am now here, writing this review.\n\nNever, ever again."
0,Golfing is fun service is poor. The waiter at bay 312 at 9pm on 10/14/14 (black visor and wannabe beard) needs to learn customer service. Our machine was down and instead of helping tried to push us to buy food. When we declined and asked if he could have someone fix our machine he gave us lip and walked off and didn't return for our next hour and a half. We paid good money to golf here ($45/he at night) and it's a shame to not even get anything from your waiter... Not even water. Golf was great though we didn't let the help ruin our night.
0,"They now have driven off a customer who used to rave about them to shop at Trader Joe's instead. Rude associates, management is a joke, selling outdated food and hassling me when I just wanted an exchange. Since changing ownership, everything I used to love about this chain is gone. ONE day use \""Made for You\"" coupons (instead of a week or two), shifting the recipes of some of the best foods to sweeter/artificial tastes, and over priced."
0,Brought my boys in for lunch today. It has been a while since i've seen such excruciatingly slow service...to the point where we almost left several times during the course of our visit. I wanted to give this place a fair shake though so I sat it out. I'm not sure how this place is for dinner but lunch is not the time to give this place a visit. \n\nThe food was just meh. My older son had an 8in pizza that was alright. I had a buffalo chicken salad that was meh. My youngest had the cheeseburger sliders that were actually a good size and seemed pretty good. But boy was the service s....l....o.....w. Drinks took a while to get refilled. Food took forever to come out. It was like watching paint dry. \n\nI might go back for an evening with friends just to see what it's like in the evening but I can tell you that I WILL NOT go back at lunch time.
0,"I admit that this is a nice hotel.  The gardens are impeccable and serene.  But the service is an embarrassment to a hotel of this caliber.  The employees are supercilious, and this attitude also runs throughout management.\n\nIn short, the employees make this gorgeous hotel an unpleasant place to stay.  The Ritz Carlton has dated decor, but has much better service."

0,"For a Tap House, both Angel's Trumpet and Ground Control are better. \n\nFirst impression of The Attic was the annoyance over having to just find the place.They didn't have a clear sign on the road. Second was the required valet parking. I don't care if it's \""free\"" (let's be real, you still need to tip the guys), but showing up at a tap house, you're not exactly expecting to hand your car over to someone.\n\nWhen we got upstairs, they had a clearly marked sign that said SEAT YOURSELF, so we thought, \""okay,\"" and started wandering around for a place to sit, squeezing ourselves all the way to the back and then circling around. No seats. Got back up to the front and asked one of the servers, who looked at us like we were stupid and said, \""you need to be put on the list.\"" Okay. Take down your sign guys, why would you have that posted? So we sat in a small section off to the side waiting and proceeded to watch several other groups come in and do the same thing we did. Unfortunately, we couldn't warn them without jumping up and catching them as it is incredibly noisy on the inside and they wouldn't have heard us from where we were.\n\nFood was alright, but not remarkable. Certainly not worth the hassle. And the beer was good, but it's not exactly hard to come across good craft beer in the valley these days.\n\nIt would have to be someone's birthday, or they'd have to have some damn, good special tapping for me to go back."
0,"I generally enjoy Jimmy John's and this place is literally 1 mi from my house, which are the only reasons I continue to give this location business. The employees are mentally very slow and they have screwed up my sandwich on several occasions. I don't order anything difficult either, usually just no tomato and sometimes I request mayo on a slim. NOT VERY COMPLICATED STUFF. \n\nIt's Jimmy John's. It's relatively fast and cheap. Liek the saying goes \""Fast, Cheap, Good. Pick two, cause you'll rarely find all three. I dread going in to order just because I can feel the level of \""idiot\"" in that place and it's stressfull."
1,"A friend had given me a gift card for this place. Since the amount was so high...I decided to make it a fun night for all of us. We got there...it was quite busy and the wait was about 30 minutes. There was not much room for a group of four of us to be at the bar...we decided to go next door and grab a drink while we waited..and were encouraged to do so. \nThe atmosphere in the restaurant...dimly lit, lots of people...and really good food!  The waiter helped us make a selection for our bottle of wine, which at the end of the meal we decided to re-cork the rest...and bring home!!  Food was excellent and fast; great for sharing so you can try a little bit of everything with a group of people. I will be back."
1,"Once again, Sheets doesn't disappoint. Went to Vegas for a work/personal trip.  Over the weekend, Sheets took care of everything and made sure our party had another epic time.  What I love about Sheets is that he isn't just a VIP host, but he really puts a personal touch in his relationships.  Although he was hosting other clients over the weekend, he made sure we were taken cared of and even did a great job connecting us to his other parties.  Having Sheets as the host definitely made the evenings that much better!  I will never plan an event without his services in Vegas!"
1,"Good selection of custom flavors. Paul Escobar is the best flavor in my opinion. Downsides are that parking costs money, on top of already higher prices. I'll go back because their flavors are worth it, but they could stand to come down a bit. Very friendly staff, nice taste test area."
0,"Don't allow smoking on their patio. We're talking about a beer joint that doesn't serve food that kicks people onto the sidewalk to smoke. Isn't it enough that people can't smoke in bars? Lame - lamer than lame. If they want to stay in business, they'll learn to cater to people who drink. Also, waitress brought 7 drinks in 4 trips...with about 2 minutes in between trips."
0,What's very happy with the service. Sat at a table next to the bar for over 30 minutes and no service. No one ever came up to me about anything. Was pretty upset.
0,"I really really really want to like the District!  But both times I was there, I had awful service - all due to the kitchen screwing up the orders. \n\nThe first time I was there I had the pork loin with the mac n' cheese.  After being the last one getting her food by a few minutes, the pork loin = not cooked on the inside.  I told the server and he said, no that is the way that it should look and went on about how they cook it back in the kitchen.  When I showed him the meat...he then said \""Oh no!  That isn't how it should be at all!\""  Takes my food away.  20 minutes later...new pork loin.  With my waiting (everybody was done by then) not having it done the first done, etc...I should have thought that I would have been compensated for something.  Nope nothing!  Oh! And the server kept on forgetting to refill my iced tea...HUGE pet peeve.\n\n2nd time was last night and my friend and I were sitting at the bar.  We ordered off the happy hour menu with the cheeseburger - no onion (me) and plain Hamburger with nothing on it but grilled onions for my friend.  And we ordered sweet potato fries.  After a half hour (and we had tickets to see Conan in another 45 minutes) our food comes out.  Mine with onions and my friend with cheese and no onions.  Oh, and no sweet potato fries.  We tell the manager the mistake and took our plates away.  We also told the manager and the bartender that we had tickets and had to leave soon.  10 minutes later...our burgers came out again.  Mine was correct, my friend didn't get her grilled onions.  The manager told us that they do not grill onions.  Ooooh-kay!  And still no sweet potato fries.  Uh, where are our fries?  The bartender never put it in the system so the manager made him do that before we could get our fries.  \nRunning late....we scarfed down our food.  \nAt least we were only charged for our iced teas for this catastrophe.\n\nThe end!"
1,"Finally a Summerlin location! Wish it was bigger inside but the food is great, nice and fresh! Owner Mark is friendly and makes sure things are done right! Love my # 9 Italian sub! Jimmy Johns by far is my fav out here! The French bread is always fresh and tasty! Good value too!!"
0,The food is good but I'm disappointed at the stinginess .. They give plastic ware but I ask for 4 paper plates and was told I have to pay a dollar a piece? Really? Horrible business practice over something like plates!
1,"VIP at the Dentist.....Yeah, Its kind of how I roll!\n\n Whenever I go anywhere I want to be treated like Paris Hilton or some other awesome celebrity, and if I do, I always return.\n\nThis best describes my experience with Floss Dental. Dr .Tran and Dr. Tounian are awesome! I first met Dr. Tran at his other office Cheyenne Dental and have since then followed him all over town to his other dental offices, never to be disappointed. EVERY TIME I have gone I have been treated like a queen. \n\nMy poor honey developed a terrible tooth ache late Friday night (worst date night ever)! We left a message with our favorite office and he was seen and fixed SATURDAY morning.....not Monday....Saturday..like the next day. SERIOUSLY! \n\nWhile I waited for these dental geniuses to take care of my man, I relished in how special we were.....until I notice how they were treating everyone else. They were just as nice to EVERYONE else too! I even heard them playing with a little girl who was nervous. LOVE LOVE LOVE this.\n\nSo, with my slightly bruised ego I realize how lucky I am to have found such a great office(s). A place that everyone knows your name (and not just my name ....lol) The Cheers of dental offices if you may. Everyone one here is nice, honest, and fun to be around. I don't remember dental offices being like that before. \n\nFloss....we will see. I might just want to get a cavity with that kind of service :D"
0,"So it's clean and they keep the riff-raff out, but honestly you can say that about McDonalds.\n\nI recently became a United Premier 1K member and I decided to check out the US Air Club during a 6 hour layover in Charlotte, after my red eye across the country. After years of hanging out in the Starbucks around the corner, I was curious to see how the 1% travelled. At the entrance, the seemed like they did not want let me in despite my first class international ticket and membership status on United.  \n\nOnce inside, the vibe is tired and bored, the TV is permanently tuned to CNN, the only newspapers are USA Today and the local paper.  On top of that the coffee is an automatic coffee machine and they only have mini-moos and coffeemate. The food options are worse. Store bought bagels and sad looking apples and oranges. Get me a NYT, a decent cup of coffee and some fresh fruit! Glad I did not have to pay for this.\n\nTwo stars for the bathrooms being clean and well stocked and the comfortable chair where I got catch up on my sleep. Ok for being complementary but there is no way I would pay anything for this!"
0,"They get ONE star, because the beds and pillows were comfy. but thats it...\n\nHere starts my Bitch rant....\n\nWell, this is the LAST time we stay at a hotel based on theme!!!! My friends and I always wanted to stay here because it always looked so hip and being music fans, all the memorabilia intrigued us. We got a great deal so we jumped on it. Little did I know the great deal was because this place and the service sucks BALLS!\nCheck in was fairly easy. Deposit was 50 per night which I haven't had at other places but whatever. We came into a hot room. A/C barely worked. No trash can in the bathroom. Who ever cleaned this room was in a rush or just didn't give a rats because she/he over looked the bobby pins and hair clips and boogers on the wall. Boogers you say? Yes we had a Fucking BOOGER collection started off on our wall that some half drunk broski in his two sizes two small affliction shirt must have started on his stay previous to ours. Gross. Toilet paper was almost gone, barely any toiletries. Who fixed our room up? Did anyone at all? Sheesh! \n\nIt took 3 calls for them to fix our AC and it didn't get fixed I called at midnight on our second night asking when someone was going to come up and fix our damn ac. Which after the fix, didn't really do much. We still were super hot. Time to sleep in our chonies I guess!\n\nCheck out was a nightmare. We were supposed to be comped out rollaway bed for our troubles and I ended up gettin charged for it plus our deposit and I'm still trying to get that resolved. You would think I would get a free night considering we slept in a sauna but whatever. Of course my extra charges like room service was billed But the credits weren't given back. The front desk can't take care of it, because they are all derp derps... you have to call a different number of course which I'm sure being hundreds of miles away is going to be a pain in the ass. When I finally got a hold of Accounting, the lady was a total CU next tuesday when I explained the situation. Im still waiting on the credits to be refunded. Its been a week. I will call again until I get my money back. \n\nThey realllllly don't want me to get nasty on the phone. \n\nOther than that, the drinks are redic expensive, the beer wenches who fetch you your drinks while you gamble take forever to bring you your drinks if you can even find them. They only saving grace is the go go dancers. But they have those at other casinos. This place is good for the music and the memorabilia. THAT IS IT. \n\n\n\nStay away if you can!"
1,"amazing food and prices , the customer service sucks though"
0,Food was alright. I got the clams with linguine in white sauce. I prefer whole clams with their shells in this pasta dish but the one here came with the canned clams. It was a little too greasy for my taste and it had too much parmesan cheese on top of it. The salad and bread was pretty good. Probably won't return.
0,"I would give this place a ZERO if I could. I was very excited of course because cupcakes excites me. But the only bad part was on how long the wait was when there was only 2 people in front of me. More like they should have more people working there. The two old lady behind me came after me and got so mad that they left. I guess you can say it took enough time to get me irritated and left as well. Sorry guys, i seriously don't think it takes that long to get service especially when you're in VEGAS!"
1,"You cant go wrong with salt and vinegar wings, a cold beer and a good game. This is one of the hubs favorite places to go and I thoroughly enjoy myself as well. I was amazed by the quality of the salad I ordered. I expected your typical run of the mill restaurant side salad - iceberg lettuce, some onions and ranch. But this was amazing. There was a variety of greens and even some extra veggies tossed in. Love it."
0,"Uhm, total waste of money. don't listen to all of the hype.. it's a total waste. made reservations 2 weeks in advance and still had to wait at an overcrowded bar for 20 minutes. my girl  friend got the classique steak and eh, it was alright. I got the fish & frites and the local market could do it better.  go eat at Marilyn's cafe instead. so disappointed in Mon Ami Gabi, was really looking forward to a great experience. it's all just a scheme."
1,"I have never actually been inside, I hope it is better than the sketchy outside, but they produce some darn good tacos!\n\nI was helping friends move and they picked up tacos for us to eat for lunch....the al pastor were my favorite, tender, flavorful and perfect in those warm corn tortillas with a squeeze of lime.  I like the carne asada also, but the pastor were by far the best.\n\nWe also got some sort of carne asada Mexican pizza, I was excited to try it, but it didn't really live up to my expectations, I thought it was a bit dry.\n\nI need to venture back and go inside (but only in the daylight) and check out what other treasures they have hiding on their menu.  I have heard the fish tacos are amazing!"
0,Desserts here are ok. Not Worth the Price. Been here 3 Times. \nThe choc Pizza is sooooo dry & nice to Look at but a Big disappointment.
1,"Water, grass and trees! Wild life. Great track : walk or run."
0,"Took my mom, for a nice Sunday morning meal. The place was dirty, and the wait staff was not very attentive to our needs. There was a group of people in booth behind my mom, and the way they where speaking was just sad. F bombs every other word, and one of the woman in the girl was going  into detail about her sexual experiences. If this is the type of clientele they want to attract because the waitress was right there talking with them while ignoring us. Then they can keep them and we will find a better place. The only saving grace so to speak was the food was decent, but not good enough to over come all the negatives."
0,"Been with them for 6 years and the quality of care has gone down. APPARENTLY calling a patient back with results is not a concern for them and they don't respond when you leave messages. No follow through with patient care, and the new staff acts like your a bother when you call. IMO a receptionist should not be giving me feedback from Dr. Finally jumping ship."
0,"Four of us went here for lunch on 02/27/14 and we all agreed it was the WORST hamburger we ever had.  The meat was tasteless and very dry and the hotdog was so awful my husband hardly ate any of it.  We all had to try the hotdog to believe it was that bad, and one bite was enough to confirm.  I don't understand how the owner can serve that kind of beef when it is his entire menu.  Perhaps if he ever tried a good burger, like perhaps Chili's burgers, he would change his meat supplier.  It was also very boring that there were no other choices of food for lunch, and not even one good dessert.  I think the waitress offered a milkshake for dessert.  Really?? The one thing we did enjoy was the French fries, but that wasn't enough to ever go back.  I spent about $70.00 (including tip) on a lunch nobody liked.  This was our only bad meal in 5 days in Vegas."
0,"I'm not a fan of Cowboy Ciao.  I know a lot of people love it, but I'm just not one of them.\n\nPeople love the chopped salad, but I don't care for Salmon, so I don't really care for the salad.  I did like how they present it and prepare it at the table.\n\nThe appetizers were okay.  I liked the mac and cheese the most, but most of the other people at our table didn't care for it.\n\nMy boyfriend and I split the Pastrami-rubbed filet mignon.  Neither of us liked it very much.  It was completely drenched in gravy.  You couldn't even taste the steak because of the gravy taste.\n\nWe had the peanut butter brownie for dessert.  It was okay, but definitely not worthy of a \""best dessert\"" award!\n\nThe worst thing was the acoustics in the restaurant.  We had a group of 8 and we could not hear each other talking.  You literally had to yell for the person next to you to hear you.  And I gave up trying to talk to anyone from the other end of the table."
1,"One word: weird. Okay, to be specific: weird if you are primarily interested in a meal. Mingo is a swanky cocktail lounge that features a full menu of original and classic dishes concocted from many cuisine inspirations including Japanese, American, Mediterranean, and South American. \n\nThe food is beautiful. Beautifully plated, beautifully seasoned, and treated with care and respect. I truly appreciate that the chefs do not fear bold flavors. My dining experience was a welcome change from the French-culinary inspired dishes I have tasted lately. \n\nMingo takes many risks with their food, such as a deep-fried, free-range chicken breast and thigh served with a mango chutney and a chimmichuri sauce. A strange combination [The chimmichuri is served on the side. (You don't have to eat it.)]. The biggest risk, though, is the space.  The layout, the tables, and the seating are not conducive to dining.  This is designed to be a lounge. The tables and seating are fine for small groups who want to have a few cocktails, but they are not suited for those who come in for dinner.  The tables are too low for the booths, and the chairs are to low for the tables.  I spent a good portion of my meal hunched over in order to eat.  This is a shame because the food is excellent.  \n\nI think this would be a great place to visit if you are a single professional working downtown who is going to sit alone at the bar and down a martini and grab a steak at the end of the day.  It is a good place if you are a small group meeting for drinks and a little nosh.  However, if you are planning dinner for two, you and your partner ought to be foodies, otherwise one of you will never want to eat here again.\n \nThat being said, I will be back.  The attention to quality demonstrated at Mingo has earned my business."
1,"Lolo's is the result of vision, and putting your heart and soul into painting that vision on the canvas of reality. From the moment my wife and I walked in, we were immersed in the soul food vibe. From the kind hostess, to the music playing softly enough to hear, but still enjoy a conversation, to the walls covered in murals of family portraits, all the way to the food... Oh my, the food. Southern fried chicken and waffles, grits, collard greens, and sweet tea in a mason jar. As I ate, all I could think was, \""Thank you, Jesus.\"" The ONLY thing that was a little disappointing was the catfish, a little too thin and a little too dry. But the rest of the experience made it a single drop of rain on a sunny day. If you're ever in Phoenix and you love soul food, do not wait as long as I did to experience Lolo's."
1,"As a connoisseur of sushi throughout the world, I was blown away by the quality, presentation and over the top taste that I experienced at this restaurant. The artistic presentation of the sushi was the best I have seen anywhere as this is an art, not a science. I cannot recommend this restaurant more strongly and look forward to returning on my next trip back to Las Vegas."
1,"Cafe Senses is one of favourite places to escape from the hustle and bustle of student life. If you want to go somewhere quite to eat or to even study, then this place is ideal! \n\nRenamed Cafe Senses a couple of years ago, the cafe offers sandwiches, some hot foods and snacks. All the foods that are available are based from primarily local, organic ingredients, with this cafe being entwined with the student association's efforts of making the university more green! The sandwiches I have had have been generally fine, nothing to rave about, but the prices are great! Much cheaper eating there than going out the campus! \n\nHowever, the main reason I like this cafe so much is that I can get a quiet table, get a cuppa and start peacefully reading over a book or some notes. Its chilled atmosphere takes you away from the noisy main library! Many first year students take an age to find this place, so the cafe is populated by older students which contributes to this chilled cafe."
0,"We ordered catering for Christmas day.  This is the first time that we catered food for a holiday and after hearing some other family members have success doing it, we decided to try it and picked AJ's Fine Foods. \n\nIt was about $130 for a turkey breast meal. Since they are not opened on Christmas day, we went and picked it up on Christmas Eve. It came with reheating instructions. When we tried to heat it up, the heating instructions were no bueno. The containers the food came in were meant for heating in the microwave and not the stove and the instructions should have included something to that affect. \n\nThe stuffing, gravy, and yams were pretty good. The meal had three huge turkey breasts that didn't seem cooked very well. We never ate the pumpkin pie that came with it so I couldn't tell you how that was. It was a lot of food for 4 people and most of it just seemed sub par. The rolls were store brand and so was the pie. It looked like they just took them off the shelves and included it in the catering. \n\nAll in all the I've had better catered food for Thanksgiving at Chicken Express when I visited my cousin in Texas. AJ's Fine Foods did not deliver the quality that I was expecting. We could have made something better ourselves. I will say however that AJ's does have a large assortment of beer."
1,"Ooooo-K! Looks like there is some pressure to give SLD a 5-star since every Elite did! ;-)\n\nYes, they deserved it! Ever tried a Gorilla dog at a Suns game? Well, there's really no comparison actually, except for its approximate 12-inch size.\n\nThe fusion of a simple, yet tasty Indian bread and the ever so popular American sausage really worked.  Upon ordering, you decide on their pre-set toppings, like 5 of them OR you can customize from 20 or so toppings.  The hot dog itself with any number of toppings is only $5.\n\nThe tricky part about customizing is understanding the flavors of each ingredient! So I had to carefully choose ones that made sense! :)  I was glad to see mushrooms on the list so I had them sauteed it.  Other ones I was happy to see were the spicy mustard and siracha!\n\nMy meal came with a bag of sea salted chips and a bottle of cold, pure sugar cane ginger ale, which was quite refreshing! My total was just $8.\n\nIf any personnel from the Phoenix Suns organization is reading this or have heard, I sure hope they would consider opening up one of these in their arena."
0,With so many options in Downtown Phoenix for happy hour we will not be visiting this place again unless beer goes on happy hour. How ridiculous! The excuse is that they are waiting for their own beers and then put them on happy hour prices but I felt very cheated when I went there for happy hour and when we got our bill realized there were no happy hour prices. I really hope they can do something about that and then we can give them another chance.
0,"I gave them a chance ate there twice, both times had to wait and they were not busy. The service sucked the food was worse. Manager was rude. I will drive the extra miles to eat at Benito Michoacan as he makes far superior food a the staff works it real good."
0,"Terrible.\n\nThe only flavor these pizzas have is salt.  That's it.  The presentation is very pretty, some one certainly cares about the product they are putting out, and its presentation.  The service is timely and polite.\n\nThere is not other way to put it, the pizza is among the worst I ever had.  Very salty- no depth of flavor, truthfully, I have had better pizza from the grocery store freezer."
1,"Went to this place last sat. with the girls, the first time myself.\n\nvery cool building and grounds.  i like the open environment and wood  throughout the rooms.  it looks as though they kept a 70's mural on some of the walls.  they were quite nice to see, as they had me realize that back not too long ago many people were not so embarrassed by nudity with out shame but with a sense of beauty and pride.  it was refreshing to see and be reminded of.\n\nhad wine, gals got beer and mojito.  ordered the cauliflower Gratiana, and the Frito misto.  the cauliflower effortlessly took the place of even the best mac and cheese. we went on to the pesto 12in pie and T ordered the risotto.  \n\nOur waiter was fun and interacted but knew his menu and pairings.\n\nreally great fun was had and all had pleasant bellies."
1,I wouldn't expect anything less for a french place in Vegas. They had good options and it was hard for me to decide what I wanted. The server was very courteous. We had a big party and we sat by the window looking out on the strip. They seated us immediately since we had reservations. I would definitely come back if I couldn't think of anywhere else to eat in the neighborhood. The prices were mediocre. Actually I consider it to be pretty affordable for Vegas.
1,Mmm one of my favorite places to go! I love almost everything on their menu and it is all very affordable :)
0,"My wife and I have been coming to either the Venetian or the Palazzo since the Venetian opened years ago. most of the time we have had good experiences however the last few times this has not been the case. \nWe took a trip to Vegas for my Birthday and once again made reservations at the Palazzo Hotel. We reserved the Sienna View Suite so we could have a view of the strip. Upon arrival at 1:30pm we asked about the strip view and we were told that yes we will have a strip view however our room was not yet ready. We were ok with this and they said they would call us as soon as the room was ready. We went to one of the restaurants and had lunch anticipating that our room would be ready within an hour or so. After finishing lunch at 3:30 we walked around until 4:00pm at which time we decided to go to a bar and await the call for our room. At 4:20pm we decided to call the front desk and they told us they were sorry we had to wait so long but our room was still not ready and that they would find us another room. We once again reconfirmed the strip view. We then went to the room that they directed us. \nUpon arrival to the suite we found that unless you smash you face against the glass there was no strip view; only a view of the parking structures and the airport. This was upsetting as we tend to spend more time in our room than others and we like to have a view. Imagine a view room without a view. \nWe then turned the TV on in the living room but it did not work. That was enough and we called the front desk to discuss the view issue and the TV. They sent a technician to our room who said the TV needed to be replaced. After discussions with the technician about the view suits he told us that for a view we should be in the 700 wing. News to us but that is not where we were. We were in the 800 wing. \nThe technician was very nice and also called the frint desk to let them know we were not pleased with our room and the issues. We received a call from the front desk almost immediately and after explaining the situation they told us that there were not other rooms available until the next day but they would give us a discount on that night which we accepted with a caveat that we may want to move to the other room the next day.\nThe next day we called the front desk at 8:00am and requested to be relocated to a view room at which time we were told that they were booked and no rooms were available. Really, that is not what we were told the day before. When I questioned this they told me that I accepted a discount and that the other room option was not available anymore. Wow. After further discussion with the front desk we were simply stuck in the room we were given with no view. What a waste of valuable time when you work 12-14 hour days and only get a short getaway once a year. \nWe will be going elsewhere in the future as it seems the customer service is going down at the Palazzo."
1,"You can get some good discounts here, and a lot of bulk items such as granola, spices, and nuts. The store is kind of like walking into a warehouse, with minimal decor and more of an industrial feel. Aisles are easy to navigate through, and there's a decent selection of foods that you would need. To keep prices low, they only accept debit if you pay by card."
1,"This is my closest Verizon store (I realize it's a franchise but still). We've gone here a few times and the service has always been good, but this last time it was excellent!  My dinosaur iPhone4 took it's final spill and it was time for me to upgrade.  Levi helped me right away, found a great upgrade deal for me and explained the entire process very well.  He was also very appreciate of my patience since the store was busy.  He was also very friendly and energetic even though it was at the end of Cyber Monday and he must have been tired!  Thanks, Levi!"
1,"Delicious huge slices for affordable prices, the combo is a great deal. Very friendly service, 6 bucks for 2 slices and a drink lunch special, tasty pizza was just what I needed to put in my belly. It was fresh out the oven, cooked to perfection and very flavorful. If you want real wood fire brick oven pizza check out this place right behind the strip!!!!"
1,"Brenden Theatres has gained back my trust by not only providing excellent customer service again, but by exceeding said customer service by going above and beyond to make sure that I would continue to patronize them. \n\nAfter my last review, I got an almost immediate response that same evening (know it's past 11 PM at this point) from Jay Jay Coulter, manager of the theatre. She apologized profusely, and offered us two tickets to be picked up at our convenience so we could return, and she took me and my husband's concerns seriously and said she would improve upon them. \n\nWell that she did. Not only has the box office returned (thank you!), but our Hollywood Movie Money issues have all but disappeared, with a couple slip-ups now and then, but overall a good experience. She even contacted me a little while ago seeing that I checked into the theatre for another film and asked me how that screening went. She also told me her action plan on making training for our issues stick in staff meetings. Now THAT is customer service. \n\nAlso awesome: last week we went to see Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter for my mom's birthday. During the third act, fire alarms kept going off. We stayed for the film, but were peeved. Apparently it was not the theatre's fault, but the casino itself, but they still gave us three free passes to make up for the inconvenience. \n\nBrenden Theatres and its management team seem to be doing a lot better and I am happy to go to this theatre once again. We're over the bad breakup, and onto the honeymoon stage again. Although it is shaky saying this in Vegas, I'm sure this time my love affair with this theatre will last. Thank you for making it up to us and really showing that you care."

0,"Beware: we ordered breakfast to the room one morning, and it came to around $50, and SURPRISE we were actually charged $99 and change. What?  Really? At first it was a 'pending charge' on our card, so we thought it was going to go down to the actual price, but it never did. That's enough to convince us that we will never stay here again. Vegas has so many other great options."

1,"On my way home from work I will stop in for the occasional mani/pedi. The staff is really friendly. They will chat if you are in the mood but if you want to stare in to a blank abyss while they are rubbing your feet they won't judge you.  Mani/pedi are 3 star worthy, long and relaxing but chip quickly. Eye brow waxing are 5 stars. \n\nPros: never a wait, affordable, clean, friendly, solid colors, private room when you can lay down to get your brows did\n\nCons: Nails chip easily (might try the gel mani next time)\n\nOverall: Solid nail spot. Will always go back"
1,"I was certainly \""lucky\"" to stumble upon this place during a late night hunger craving fest and had some of the best hashbrowns I've had in long time. The breakfast was phenomenal and it totally hit the spot perfectly. To make sure I wasn't consumed by my hunger and fooling myself into thinking it was some of the best food ever, I came back during lunchtime later and tried some of their lunch specials to which I was again impressed with the caliber and quality of food they had prepared. The service was equally attentive at the late night hours as it was during the day. The decor is fun, makes for a trendy and hip eatery. Prices won't be too high, like all Vegas diners / eateries, this 24/7 joint is inexpensive as it is fun!"
1,"This is a very different show. Nothing like I've ever seen before. However still very entertaining and interactive with the audience. Music was great!! (drums,guitars ect.)and also had good humor. Highly recommended show. Worth every dollar!"
1,"Flew back to Burbank on a Tuesday night a few weeks ago, and was craving a beer before my flight. Popped into CPK and was bowled over by the impressive customer service I received from my bartender Lu. She was attentive and personable, and truly cared about doing a great job. It's really nice to be served by someone who takes pride in what they do and cares to get to know their customer. I will be back next time!"
0,Horrible service. Took forever to serve the complete order. Don't want to waste more time by writing a more elaborate review.
1,"Great atmosphere, very laid back, friendly service, excellent food with more than generous portions."
0,"These people broke my stud and didn't replace it, citing \""rust\"" that wasn't there.... and on top of that they recommended I buy wheel locks for EVERY single stud (when you only need one per tire).\n\nIt wasn't until a few years later that I figured out that they duped me.  These people are jerks."
1,"We will return for generous servings at reasonable prices and speedy service. Face East for the best view. Face North only if you are into voyeurism, they have a very long happy hour. Opening in the summer gives the opportunity to get the staff functioning and ready for the snowbirds. Would post the menu if Yelp showed how."
1,"Definitely a contender for best restaurant in Madison. The bartenders know their stuff and the kitchen, too. Try the pork paperdelle -  it's amazing."
0,"We used to really like this place and have taken at least two dozen people here, some of which are regular diners now. That was then..\n\nMy husband tried to use a coupon from Dine4az.com and the owner refused to take it, saying it was a fake coupon. First of all, Dine4az.com is a site that restaurants sign up to promote their restaurants. Not just anyone can create a fake coupon and post on that site. The owner completely embarrassed my husband in front of a very large group of friends tonight and made my husband pay for the cheese crisp on the coupon. \n\nWe will never be back!"
1,"Great breakfast joint and cheap. Try the southern Benedict...sausage patty, eggs, biscuit smothered in gravy. Mmm delicious. Try their pancakes and get a side order of sausage and bacon. It is a nice way to start the Saturday....warning you will feel sluggish after eating....I suggest taking a nap."
0,"I never thought it would happen. Guy Fieri betrayed my love and did me wrong. My heart is heavy. **cue woeful harminica**\n\nHubby, daughter and I embarked upon Piazza al Forno after watching triple D and seeing the menu online. We got there and were seated next to a large group that was incredibly loud. So not the restaurant's fault they were obnoxious. But, the waitress would talk to us in her \""inside voice\"" which made her sound like Charlie Brown's teacher. Project, woman. Project!\n\nThe service was just so lacking. If you are clairvoyant, this is a good place for you. Those of us less gifted need not attend. She asked us if we were ready to order several times and saw we were clearly struggling to decide. Never offered menu info or a run down of specials. She didn't even offer a wine list! This week has sucked, so imagine my horror upon thinking this place was dry as no one ever alluded we could have a glass of wine or presented a list! Mama needed some wine. Help a sister out. \n\nOur food came and we got the fried ravioli, baked spaghetti and the Italian Stallion. Nothing was even remotely worth writing home about. The baked spaghetti gave me the sense that they made a whole mess of spaghetti early in the day and threw it in the overn to heat it up when needed. Viola! Baked spaghetti!\n\nWhen we appeared done she just brought us our check. Apparently, my brain waves caught on with their psychic vibe and told her we wanted to get out of dodge.  She never even asked us about dessert or brought back a menu. So, we went to Gelato Spot and I had triamisu flavored gelato. Done. \n\nWanted to love this place but it was so lackluster. So many places in the valley are better."
1,Try the chicken tamales and burritos they are great.  Everything is made fresh.... hidden gem!
1,"If you're from Hawaii and visiting Vegas, you will definitely LOVE this place!! Once I tried this place for the first time, I had to beg my boyfriend to keep coming back to eat. Definitely makes you feel at home. Their garlic chicken and fried saimin were delicious! The staff were also very friendly. Who knew you could eat such good local Hawaii food in another state?!"
0,"Bad sign when the salsa tastes bad.  Not bad-boring, like, bad-bad.  Like there was something unpleasant in it.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer platter with a few different dips.  This wasn't bad-bad, just bad-bland.\n\nBy the time our entrees arrived, I wasn't too excited.  They were okay.  I had the mahi crisp, which is kind of like a tortilla pizza, I guess, and that was probably the best of the bunch.  Still, the described tamarind sauce didn't taste like tamarind, and the wasabi flavoring didn't have any bite.\n\nWorst of our group was my wife's veggie torta - the vegetables were sparse and had a burnt aftertaste.\n\nWhen I heard the place was \""contemporary Mexican,\"" I was hoping for something like Gallo Blanco's delicious interpretations of Mexican classics, but, overall, the place felt like an extremely expensive Taco Bell.  Attempts at \""fusion\"" or \""innovative\"" Mexican cuisine don't really work if the end result doesn't even slightly resemble authentic Mexican food - or doesn't even have a bold flavor at all, period.  I don't think there was a leaf of cilantro in our entire meal.\n\nAt these prices, the food should at least be notable enough to have a strong opinion about.  And, to add insult to injury, the service we got was terrible - when one of our friends asked if an appetizer would make a suitable entree, portion-wise, the waitress literally sneered at her - \""I don't know how much you eat.\"""
0,"IDespicable Bahh Mi.  Stale bread, no flavor, just awful.  Why did I go here?  There was a much better banh mi place across the street, yet here I went.\n\nIt's not Cao Thang's fault, it's mine."
1,"The boys and I had a very good, relaxing meal here last Friday night.  Very nice restaurant in Cosmo restaurant row. Place is classy but not the least bit stuffy. Like everyone mentions, the bread selection is great. Mini Stromboli's w/ sides of marscapone, tomato/garlic...really good. Went through several of the pasta dishes for the table to begin. Duck and Foi Gras Ravioli, Risotto w/ short rib and Short Rib and bone marrow angolotti all good to excellent. Nothing better than home made pasta. Polenta w/ truffled mushrooms might have been even better that the pasta dishes...must try! I had the Veal Loin and Pork Belly. The loin was a bit dry, but flavorful..the Pork Belly was spectacular.  Friends had steak and halibut, all were very happy. Wine list is amazing..tons of Italian wines...pricey! Found a good bottle for around $100.  Overall, pretty reasonably priced meal for Vegas.  Good stuff Scott!"
1,"Amanda Melby is amazing.  I came to her for help with getting my non-existent Voiceover career off the ground, and she was an amazing help.  I've since taken several classes from her studio and each was a great value with great takeaways.  And on top of everything else, Amanda is one of those amazingly efficient people who always gets back to you within a day or so despite her hectic schedule.  Highly recommend for any of your acting, or performing needs!"
1,I recently had a birthday and as part of the celebration my partner ordered a cake from Scot's. The cake was beautifully decorated and tasted delicious. I would highly recommend them for any of your dessert needs! I should also mention we split a cookie and it was fantastic as well!
1,"My first visit to Mallorca was really quite nice.  I got a table outside on a lovely day, and besides one pestering fly and an over-zealous breeze, it was very pleasant.  I started with an appetizer of stuffed mushrooms.  The mushrooms were cooked very well (they were still solid, not overly done and mushy) and the stuffing had a nice taste although I found it to be a bit on the liquidy side.  For my meal I had the veal with mozzerella sauce.  It came out in an iron dish that had obviously come straight from the oven, and I had at least five pieces of veal swimming in a delicious cheese sauce that was slightly darkened on the top, which I loved.  The veal may have been sliiiightly overdone, but it had a very nice flavor and went with the sauce very nicely.\nThe only minor complaint I have is that the service was a little inconsistent.  I arrived for dinner right at 5pm on a weekday with a friend, and we were two of possibly four total people in the restaurant at the time.  I guess the staff was feeling rather bored, because whenever we would need attention at our table, we were surrounded by a minimum of three servers.  Which was very attentive and I appreciated the service, although it did make me slightly uncomfortable.  But the really uncomfortable thing was whenever our servers were done helping us, they stepped back about three feet and just stood behind our table the entire time.  Now THAT was uncomfortable.  And slightly creepy.  But we got all of our food in a very timely manner, which was excellent.  But then as the restaurant started to fill up, we requested our bill, and ended up waiting about 20 minutes for it.  We figured they had forgotten about us, until the bill finally arrived and we realized it had been laying on top of the servers' station a few feet from us the entire time.  So they didn't forget about us, just the bill.  \nSo although the service went from practically sitting on my lap to forgetting that we weren't trying to do a dine and dash, the food really was quite good and I'll definitely be back."
0,"I have been to this place a few times for both shopping and dining in the cafe. Here is what I like:\n\nDelicious food that is healthy and tasty \nNice selection of healthy foods \n\nHere is what I don't like:\nThe service - the people at the cafe in particular. They would rather inconvenience you, the customer, than to go out of their way to provide any type of service, Which leads me to the second thing that I dislike, which is their prices. I realize that the price point is a little higher for some of your items, and I would be fine with that if I felt I was appreciated as a customer, but since that's my first dislike, then this makes the prices much less palatable. \n\nI mean seriously."
0,"My wife and I ate here over a year ago, and I was very disappointed in the meal.  I agree that for the price, I'd expect a nicer place with better service and not an entrance from the parking lot that is like a service entrance.\n\nThe food was nothing special.  It is an amalgam, and that's not what we were looking for.  We wanted good Cuban food.  Not here.  This is the one food area where Las Vegas is really lacking."
0,Totally bummed that when I ordered TOFU and VEGGIES it came out cooked in chicken broth.  I'm sure it is my fault and I should have specified that I was a vegetarian but I thought that was implied from the conversation I had with the waitress and by the order.  I don't know any meat eaters (though I am SURE they exist) that order tofu & veggies when they go out to dinner.  I sent my food back and left.  :(
0,"Thinking I would play it safe my first time here, I ordered the Asian Steak Salad.  You can't ruin salad, right? Bleh! The steak was a cheap cut that was chewy and fatty. The mandarin oranges tasted like they came out of a can and the lettuce was wilted. Oh the apple bread was stale. Won't be paying a visit here again which is too bad as I live within walking distance."
0,"I called to see about making plans for  my sister  to get married in their drive-thru later this year.  The woman on the phone was as rude as it get's and would not directly answer my questions, she was like a robot and kept repeating herself.  What a jerk!"
0,"I went to a conference here and a lot of smelly homeless people came in and took food. I think one photobombed me as I took a selfie with an old friend. Otherwise, the place is beautiful."
0,"I wish yelp had 0 star rating ..because this eyebrow threading place deserves 0 star. 2 sisters run the place with 0 customer service skills. Today I walked in there one of the sisters was doing eyebrows.no greeting when u walk in. Once she started doing my eyebrows it was painful (I have been getting threading for 4+ years).I asked if she could use baby powder because that always seems to help with the pain. She said \""I don't put powder on my customers\"" \"" I don't see good\"". I told her I always have get powder if it hurts so much..she said \""no..you know u came in at my closing time anyway' and told me to leave and walked away. I was shocked! So she had me leave with half started one eye brow. Seriously DON'T go!"
1,By far the best Mexican Food in Phoenix! I love everything about this place!
0,I want to add that after leaving this review about my experience. USA went on my company profile and left a bad review when they have never used my company for any of their service. I got a call at my home from someone named Chris telling me that they were going to leave a bad review for my company profile on yelp. Very Bad Experience. Long story short they lied to me. Lady started crying and apologized to me for trying to take me. Told me that business has been really slow and because of me that they will never think about taking someone again. I still don't recommend this company. Please don't go here!!!
0,"My family and I have been faithful, frequent patrons of this place for 6 1/2 years.  We appreciated the service, food, and prices.  However, things have changed for the worse!  On our last few visits, the portion sizes have been consistently shrinking.  I suspect sub-standard ingredients in use, as well.  Such a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  After all this time, I can no longer count on my expectations being fulfilled.  I feel so CHEATED!  I would much rather see a fair price increase than have to search for a new favorite spot."
1,"Welcome to Montreal, home of the poutine. Of course we had to try only the best poutine place in town, La Banquise.\n\nThis was my second time in this place, the first being back in March. I tried the traditional the first time (pure awesomeness), but this time I wanted to add some toppings, so I tried to B-O-M. Yummy.\n\nThe portions are big even for a small (regular) size, I barely finished it (but took me a good 40-45 minutes to do so), and my friends who ordered a large barely finished half of it.\n\nWhen I'm here in Ontario I'll get my Smoke's Poutinerie fix, but it's honestly not even close compared to La Banquise. Cream of the crop right here."
0,"My experience with this company was very poor to say the least.  As a first time home renter they taught me several lessons.  Everything in the beginning was smooth they answered questions, phone calls and texts messages quickly and professionally.  two months after I moved in a faulty substandard cabinet in the laundry area collapsed damaging both my washer and dryer, my property!  I attempted to contact my \""property manager\"" several times by phone and text to report what happened and received absolutely no reply.  A few months later the roof started leaking badly, Once again i attempted to contact my \""property manager\"" even sent photos of the leak and once again no reply from anyone at all.  I then decided to move because they do not care about either my living conditions or my property.  After giving my required 30 day notice all of a sudden I started receiving calls and texts from AZ elite properties and all they cared about was scheduling new tenants to come look at the house.  I complied with all of their request as usual.  It just so happen to rain on a day they had new tenants looking at the house and the roof was leaking.  Within two days they had the roof fixed even though I had lived with the leak for six months.  Over the course of a year I did not hang anything on the walls nor did I paint anything the house was exactly as it was when I moved in.  I paid for the house to be cleaned (even though I had paid a non refundable cleaning fee) when I moved out and even gave the keys back two days early.  They then waited the full 14 days to send me my deposit back and when I received it it was $145 short for \""yard clean up\""!  The back yard at this property was \""completely\"" bare un finished no grass no trees no bushes nothing!  Had they advised me of a problem I would have corrected it right away.  Once again after no reply from anyone at all from AZ elite properties I will chalk this up as a learning experience, for me its not about the money if $145 is worth a bad reputation then so be it.  I tell everyone I know about my experiences with this company, very unprofessional!"
0,"Is it possible to give something less than 1 star ?\n\nReading the reviews here, I think we went to a different show, I mean seriously, I expected a little bit of Vegas OTT, but wow, how to describe this train wreck of a show......\n\nThink high school musical, with breasts, lots and lots and lots of breasts....And feathers.\n\nBeing serious, don't waste your hard earned money on this."
1,"This review is on the casino and not the hotel.\n\nMe and my friends gambled her for about 2 hours and it was our favorite casino experience.\n\nStaff-wow I have to say all of the staff were very good looking. Guys and girls were all very hot and attractive. I was lovin it! And they were all smiling and talkative to guests, and very nice. This was my fav staff in Vegas because it's very comfortable to gamble with people and staff that are happy with their jobs and not like other casino where the casino staff are over it and ready to slap everyone. Cocktail host came around literally every 10 mins and she new what we were drinking after the first time or ding so she kept bringing refills, now that is amazing service. Never seen that in any casino.\n\nCasino- I would have to say the casino is small but it's a boutique hotel so it's except able. Decor looks similar to the Cosmo. Very modern, and hip, and very sheek. Clean and smelled like flowers in there. It was a good experience, we came back the next day and gambled more."
0,"I'm sitting on the throne pissing out of my ass....can you guess how this review is going to play out?\n\nLet's begin...service was awful. Sat outside and was helped by a young girl who between visits to the table was popping zits on her face...had a couple tiny drops of blood leaking of them smh\n\nFood: smfh\nSimple enough..carn\u00e9 asada burrito with cheese.\nMeat was real fatty, guacamole was runny and abundant. Cheese....this cheese was the kind of unnatural cheese that will NEVER melt if you dropped it in a fire pit. Bottom of my burrito was cold, yet the top was warm...hmmm I wonder why...maybe because the plate felt like they just got it out of the refrigerator...\n\nNever saw the server again...probably popping more pimples.\n\nTired of waiting I went to the window to ask if someone could bring me my check...only to be told oh there is no check you pay at the window. Nice to know.\n\nNEVER will I visit this dump again!"
1,"I enjoy coming to First Watch when I'm in the mood for  a relaxed, easy-going experience for breakfast.  I always get in quickly and we get service quickly.  Plenty of space in the restaurant - bright and airy. The menu is perfect for breakfast.  Lots of healthy options.   Omelets are tasty. Love the french toast and pancakes too."
0,"Expensive. 50 bucks for two people, one kid, one drink. Food was OK, but not spectacular. Margarita slightly sickly sweet. Bagged chips. Peasant tacos were good, but oddly greasy."
1,"Zookz wasn't even on my gastronomic radar as I was driving south on Central Avenue on my way to Burton Barr Library around lunch time today.  However, it was the first restaurant on Yelp's list as I searched on my phone.  I caught a glimpse of it as I drove by to my right and immediately took the first right to circle back to it. \n\nVery friendly staff is what greeted me upon walking in.  They could sense immediately it was my first because I most likely gave an impression of a Golden Retriever puppy that walked into the neighbor's house: confused, lost and maybe a little intimidated due to unfamiliarity.  The staff eased me in however and made me feel at home within moments, explaining what they offer and serve.  I asked what their recommendations were and both gladly obliged.  Tara (I didn't get her name but calling her that because she looks like the young Tara Reid) chose No 11; while Guy (just because he was a guy) picked No 45. Both choices looked equally appetizing based on the ingredients' description from the overhead menu, but I was leaning towards No 11 because it was Tara's choice plus it had cream cheese which we both like.   As Tara was taking my order, Guy threw in a last-second recommendation - No 25 - which he said I could customize by adding cream cheese (yay Tara) and bacon.\n\nI decided to sit outside on the patio so I could enjoy this fantastic weather and have a chance to observe the surroundings.  Soon after, my order was brought to my table, enclosed in the paper bag Tara had written my order on.  Taking the sandwich out of the bag, the aroma alone whetted my appetite even more, but I was a little disappointed because a wall picture inside had me visualizing a more substantial delight.  I stared at it for a few seconds as I struggled to mentally grasp what I was looking at because it looked like two slightly larger dollar-sized pancakes fused together in a panini fashion. Nonetheless, my first bite could not have prepared me for the explosion of flavors in my mouth; all the ingredients popped and the flavors blended well together with every bite.  The consistency of the sandwich was toasted/baked/paninied (however they made it) perfectly.  It was crusty on the edges but soft and gooey in the middle.  As unsubstantial as I thought it was, I took my time relishing it anyway because the place invited me to just relax and to enjoy the moment.  The head cook/chef perhaps owner even took the time to check on each customer which added to the relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.  \n\nOverall, it was a worthwhile snappy decision to choose this place and I'll definitely be back.\n\nP.S.\n\nOwners of Zookz, give Tara and Guy raises because those two were excellent wait/counter staff.  They were both helpful, engaging and definitely knew what the cafe had to offer.  One last thing, can I get Tara's number?  ;)"

0,"After so many review updates, I usually cease to write more unless I have something really noteworthy to add (a new menu addition or fave dish, or great customer service rendered, etc).  Unfortunately, I will have to say that this morning's breakfast of biscuits and gravy and a platter of peach creme brulee pancakes didn't have us leaving w/ happy stomachs :(  \n\nThere were a couple of hitches, but these were easily amended.  (I think my love affair of DD's biscuit and gravy has ended.)  My major gripe was that our gingerbread pancakes did not contain candied ginger pieces-- did Daily Dose switch to a new mix/formulation?  If yes, please switch back!  The pancakes we had today were too dense and not at all the flavorful-spicy and texturally-exciting cakes we've had in the past :(  The peach creme brulee sauce also didn't arrive warmed, and instead was squeezed unappetizingly onto a sauce dish.  The leftovers that I usually get to enjoy again on one of my work breaks ended up in the trash.\n\nI'm going to go back again soon to give DD another try... I'd like to keep it on my list of fave brekky places!"
0,"I had such a horrible experience with Margie as my midwife. I chose her because she had so much experience and knowledge and came with good recommendations, big mistake. As my due date grew near, I realized that a majority of the time during my prenatal appointments with her were spent by Margie talking about HERSELF - her pregnancies, her health problems, her family history. Many of my concerns were brushed off and she was condescending because this was my first pregnancy. Meanwhile she would contradict herself and did not remember details about my pregnancy or my family or my medical history. I had already been paying a significant amount of money for her services, so I felt that I was stuck with her. When the big day(s) finally arrived, I truly regretted hiring this lazy woman. I ended up in labor for three days and she only came over once for about 10 minutes. I had a horrendous labor that was not progressing, and despite this Margie was not concerned about the well being of my child. On the third day of labor, when she didn't come check my baby's heart rate or check on me, I went to the hospital. I was suffering from exhaustion and dehydration, and my baby was in distress. Margie harassed my family to let her into my house to get her things while I was in the hospital, but couldn't care less about calling me to ask about my health or my daughter's health. She was supposed to provide postnatal care and lactation consulting, but we haven't heard from her. After all was said and done, we paid her $300 an hour to talk about HERSELF!!!"
0,The music great but the drunken crowd was horrible...everyone was pushing and shoving. The whole time I was there I asked myself where security was to regulate. I didn't like the atmosphere and security needs a whole lot of work.
0,"Let me start by saying the staff was GREAT!  our server was awesome, hostess was great, and the backwaiters were all great!  The food itself was dissapointing.  We started with the smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail & stuffed mushrooms.  The smoked salmon was ok, but barely any smoke flavor came thru, shrimp cocktail was average, nothing special, and the stuffed mushrooms were very bland, just not much to them.  We then had the lobster bisque, wedge, french onion soup & caprese salad.  The lobster bisque was very good, the wedge was also good, the french onion soup was average and the caprese salad was disappointing.  All of the steaks were good, not great, but good, and at $50-$60 a steak, I do expect my steak to be as good or better then I can make at home, but again, wasn't blown away.  The sides were disappointing, the mac and cheese was a big lump of cheese, not a creamy consistent sauce, but a stuck together lump of cheese & noodles.  The crab & Nocchi side was bland, no flavor, tasted like flour & sauce, garlic mashed potatoes were good.  Overall not what I expected from a steakhouse that had been reviewed so well.  As someone who cooks all the time, I may be a little critical, but when I spend over $400 on dinner, I would like to be blown away, and I wasn't, not even close."
0,"If I could give Sophia Fiori negative stars, I would. Please do your research online and you will see they are SCAMMERS!!!! I wish I had....The only reason I purchased from this company was because we had a friend working for their co. She actually drove me to their warehouse where I hand picked the jewels that I wanted. Mind you, I know jewelry and I knew these were not DeBeers or Harry Winston, but they were beautiful pieces, plus I wanted to help her and let her get the commission. I should have know something was up when they didn't want to take American Express! This was the first red flag. I insisted, as this was the only card I had on me, and they accepted it. I purchased the jewels and enjoyed them, but a few months later, my friend told me that she saw the EXACT SAME bracelet I purchased for $18k on a cruise ship (SF sells on ships- another red flag), for $8k! I never had the jewels appraised, so I wasn't sure. I contacted Bernard Bachoura, who claims to be the designer who joined his family's business when he was 16. I was pretty upset, as you would imagine, well Bernard's smug, arrogant attitude did nothing to calm me down. My husband called him back and apologized, saying I was tough, but I honestly did not like the idea of my husband buying me this beautiful jewelry that was actually all a farce- because it was A COMPLETE RIP OFF. In any case, Mr. Bachoura explained that if we got an appraisal we would \""see that the bracelet was worth 18k.\"" He claimed he would \""stand behind his brand\"". Really? My husband and I knew this was a false claim, but went and got the appraisal anyways. Guess what:  we got the bracelet appraised (by a leading jewelry co) for $8400.00. So when we sent this to Bachoura what did he do, he disputed our dispute with American Express, never return phone calls, never returned emails, and the only thing he is standing behind now is shadows. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. THEY ARE SCAMMERS. He may give out swag to celebs to get some press, but the REAL CLIENTS PAY FOR IT WITH SUB-STANDARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICE."
0,"I've eaten here a handful of times and have had a mediocre experience or even less than mediocre each time I have visited. I wish this place were more like Smoke in Homestead, or even Edgar's in the Strip (those are two excellent examples on how to make delicious tacos), but it's not even close. The tacos lack flavor and are far too expensive for food that's not nearly as good as I can make at home. I sent the steak tacos back once because they had nearly no flavor. Another time we ordered the guacamole and it was made with unripe avocados. I gave it one final chance after they sent out an email saying they had retooled their menu, but the tacos were still incredibly disappointing. It's frustrating given it's one block from my house. I'd go here at least once a week if the food were better."

We got the meat pie and I added jalapenos on half of it. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised when we got home! Everything is made from scratch and incredibly delicious! There was a party in my mouth and everyone was invited! I highly recommend this place for a yummy pizza and great customer service. They are now on my regular list."

I read the negative reviews on service on Yelp, but we decided to take a chance. The service was good and the food was delicious. Being from San Diego, we have our share of excellent Mexican Restaurants but Sonrisa offered some new and different flavors and menu choices. The tortilla soup was rich and smokey - unlike any I've had before. You must try the ribs! The ribs were so delicious - dressed in a thick, smokey sauce with a bit of a kick, and served with the a mango salsa. I'd never thought to pair mango and ribs together but it was so delicious. I tried to get the rib recipe from the waitress, but she wouldn't reveal the \""secret spices\"". The margaritas were tasty too. Not too sweet and served in a larger glass than usual. Would definitely return on our next visit."
0,"I sincerely make an effort to try local favorites while I'm traveling and I've heard a lot of hype about Primanti's. Let me just say, for the record, carb on carb action is not really my thing. Frankly, french fries and sandwiches aren't really my thing. So together it was definitely scary. \n\nI sat at the bar for a late lunch. The staff was fine but mostly disengaged. I had an order of wings with the garlic parmesan sauce and a pittsburger (get it?) with an added egg. The wings were actually pretty good. I liked the sauce and it was fun to try something totally different compared to regular wing sauce. They had many other options of sauces that I would consider returning for. \n\nWhen the sandwich came out I could barely see the meat as it was overwhelmed by coleslaw and fries. Once I'd scraped off half of each of those to make it more mouth acceptable I noticed that the meat was pretty small compared to everything else going on here. And that it bore a concerning resemblance to a mcdonald's 'meat' patty. Hmm...\n\nFrankly, even if I liked french fries or sandwiches I don't think I would have liked this rendition. The french fries were, weirdly, simultaneously soggy but also a little undercooked. The patty was gross. I ended up leaving much of this behind. I even tried to drown it in ketchup but it still left me feeling kind of gross. The rest of the day I felt a little queasy. Not really a good experience."
1,great customer service. Had a classic-tasted quite good.
0,"Did not have to wait, guys were nice, gel manicure was subpar. $25 for gel but if you want a manicure its $32. Why extra for them to cut cuticles? Very strange. Tim did my nails and the polish was messy. He got it on my cuticles and under the nails - not much attention to detail. Will not be returning."
0,"Terrible service, we waited almost an hour for our food; they brought us our appetizer but nothing else we told them we're leaving we are paying for the appetizer , we are not paying for anything else and left."
0,"This is an unusual place which is good and bad. It's part bar / bookstore / hookah / whatever else happens to be going on. I went there just to hang out and it's a good thing I wasn't too hungry. I bought one of the pre-packaged sandwiches and it was quite old. The beer and wine selections are quite limited. The hookah is the draw.\nIf you're in the area, this isn't a bad place to drop by and see what (if anything) is happening. Otherwise, it's not worth the drive."
1,"Amazing! Highly recommend! Amazing food, service, ambiance and uber cool vibe all in one! Modern elegance! Great flavors! Would defiantly go here again!!"
1,I have been going to Holley's for 2 years now and love it!!!! By the way Happy Birthday!!!! It is a great place where you and your friends can just sit back and laugh for hours.  Thank you Holley for becoming a part of the Mountains Edge family!!
1,"\""Sex Appeal Drives a Crown Vic LX with Leather Interior\""\n\nI've come to adore the welcome wagon here. \nThey're always out front, waving and whistling, gesturing to come hither.\nI know I'm a hottie but DANG they make me feel so sexy! \nSometimes when I'm lonely I pull into Star Nursery and slowly idle through, basking in attention like a pageant winner.\nRadiant, I sometimes wave back, moving my hand as if screwing in a lightbulb.\nThey love me here. They truly do. Even when I don't make a purchase.\n\nBut usually when I leave, my Crown Vic LX with leather interior is loaded with merchandise.\nOver the past year I've spent thousands here on sod, rock, and sago palm.\nFlowering cactus and oleander. \nJapanese boxwood, hawthorne, and aloe. \nEven a fake owl to scare away pigeons. \nEmployees are very helpful and always ask if I need carry service to the Crown Vic LX with leather interior. \nI smile and say no thanks, for I am dynamite beneath my hoodie, more than capable of bare-handing cactus while simultaneously hauling rock bags.\n\nI glow in their adoration and applause. Sometimes for hours.\n\nAnd I love walking around in back. It's well shaded and humid from watering, almost like a rainforest, the scent of foliage and earth an elixir on par with the welcome wagon.\n\nI come here often, and will continue to do so.\n\nThey have what I want.\n\nAnd I have what they want.\n\n*shakes ass and winks with handfuls of cash from window of Crown Vic LX with leather interior"
1,Brand new fresh casino to give a quick review on.. I liked the decor inside and the selection of slots was far from a lot but the place is just down right different inside.. I wasn't able to sample any food or rooms but I think the casino was fun and the free slot play was a bonus worth visiting for.. I plan on returning here again and staying  over night to give the rooms a review which I hope will add.. Downtown Grand get's my thumbs up for now!
1,"Great coffee, cool building.  The crowd is a cross between over aged hipsters still trying to hang on and newbie hipsters trying to create a faux urban lifestyle in Phoenix."
1,"Love that the restaurant is based on fresh local ingredients. Great atmosphere and decor, great service...my glass of water was never below half full. We ordered the goat cheese appetizer, it was really good, loved it with the beets. I ordered the smokey burger. The flavour was fantastic fries were great, but trying to eat the burger without it falling apart was impossible. My husband ordered the sirloin steak and mushrooms...he said it had great flavour but the cut of meat wasn't that great, very chewy, with gristle through the middle. Had the s'mores parfait for dessert...really, really good! \nI would definitely return, but will try the prime rib or a fish entre next time."
0,So we just finished a wonderful meal at outbacks  and we go to pay and find out that they don't support the military.    I will stick to place that actively support the military.
0,"The food was pretty decent, but the waitresses were inattentive. No ambiance. Good green tea. They tried to commit our order to memory, which was a colossal failure. Both orders were slightly wrong."
0,"First let me say, I've frequented Throve often and the Acai Bowls here are delicious. That being said, I am often left wanting more. \n\nFirst and foremost, because everything is fresh and made to order, it takes a whole to get your bowl. No complaint here, this is to be expected. However, you're often left waiting at the counter for minutes at a time before someone helps you. \n\nMost recently, I've found a favorite bowl, the Strawberry Passion. I've ordered it three to four times in the last couple of weeks. Prior to today, everything had been satisfactory. Today definitely was not. For a Strawberry Passion, even a medium, I expect there to be a good portion of strawberries. Nope! Literally less than one strawberry was used. It's honestly such a bummer. This happened once before. I mentioned it, and they said I should request to add more strawberries to the order. \n\nOf course, whenever they market their bowls, it's loaded with fruit on top. Kind of like how in McDonalds commercials, what you see actually looks good on TV...that is until you order it and then you're left disappointed. \n\nI'm not sure if it just depends on who's working, but they really need to step it up."
0,"Pretty nice selection of lights (geesh I would hope so) & the customer service is MEH!  My beef - I received a gift card, tried to order online & you can't use it online. SO I went in the store, ordered it and they don't even deliver to my house, I've got to go back in to pick it up.  I'm not lazy by all means, but really?  Gift cards happen all the time in our DAY IN AGE, get it together Lamps P, good grief!  Moral of the story kids, don't buy anyone gift cards from L.+ (I'm completely grateful for the gift & thought but completely inconvenienced by the store's lack of modernization)."
1,"Now, I can think of several places in town that serve amazing pizza - La Grande, and Pizzeria Bianco come immediately to mind.  But Pizza Heaven gets 4 stars for other reasons.  It's cheap, tasty no-frills kind of pizza , with something for everyone.  \n\nThe pizza itself is thin crust with a nice crispy, yet doughy taste.  The ham, cheese (very good cheese, btw) and mushrooms I had on pizza tasted fresh and the toppings were generous.  \n\nSomething that sets it apart is the wide variety of toppings and the restaurant's perceived desire to offer something for everyone.  The menu includes more than 20 veggie toppings, lowfat cheese and soy cheese upon request - something you don't find much of at a pizza joint - much less the fancy pizza palaces of Phoenix!  \n\nThe decor inside is very simple - chairs and tables - no booths.  They had the basketball game on TV in the background, and even have a live band on Friday and Saturday night - not sure on the type of music.  Give them a call to find out.   They serve the normal selection of pizza, pasta, subs and salads and even have a limited offering of beer and wine for the tipplers out there...\n\nBTW: The location is new - having relocated up the road to bigger digs (now at 5150 N 7th St. betw. Camelback and Missouri)."
0,"Extremely disappointing.  We waited two hours to receive a farmers market salad that had little more than a couple pieces of  blue cheese and onion we could have made at home, as well as a pizza that tasted like rubber.  We ordered the margarita pizza and tried to be polite and eat with fork and cut with knife, but it was like cutting rubber.  The crust was not finished and the pizza was less than par.  The table next to us was filled with screaming patrons who sat there a good 45 minutes after they signed their check.  It was completely not worth the wait.  Waste of time and a complete let down.  Don't waste the time, it is not worth it."
0,"Even ignoring all the hype, this place is only worth two stars.  The ridiculous line out the door didn't help it anyway.\n\nI ordered a cheddar cheddarish cheddar burger or something like that.  Really good cheese I will admit.  But thats the only good thing about this burger.  Didn't have any sauce that I can remember, but that is fine.  Lettuce, tomato, and bun were average.  The meat was very unimpressive.  It was thin and flavorless.  It reminded me of the sort of hamburger meat you would get at a school cafeteria.\n\nThe fries were the horrible shoestring junk you would find at in-n-out.  They don't taste like potatoes, but instead taste like whatever grease they were fried in.  I'm pretty fed up with this whole trend of thin crispy fries.  Give me steak fries.  The place is called steak and shake isn't it?\n\nThe milkshake was average at best.  Pretty much the same shake you would expect from mcdonalds.  I'll continue to go to jack in the box if I want a milkshake.\n\nMy buddy ordered the chili.  It was pretty bland and unimpressive from what I heard.\n\nAfter our food was delivered we were completely ignored by the waiter.  Never got any drink refills and never got the mustard we requested."
1,"Pearce's is a fantastic, vibrant, friendly cafe / pub / restaurant 5 minutes walk from Waverley steps (if you have long legs like me).\nIt would probably consider itself a pub first and a cafe / eatery second, but the standard of food served here is honestly better than most of the restaurants I have visited in the city. Top-class stuff.\nDuring the day there is a section at the rear of the bar dedicated to customers with young children, something I hadnt seen before and thought I would hate, but it actually creates a really friendly, cheerful atmosphere in the bar.  \nThere are often events like art auctions and baking competitions held here, which although twee sounding, help add a unique flavour to the place and really help Pearce's stand out from the crowd.\nGreat for a drink or a bite to eat on a sunny afternoon, as well as a relaxing pub to unwind in during the evening."
1,"*Mine & the Kid's- Cheese Burger w/ Grilled & Raw Onions.\n*His- Double-Double protein style.\n\nI don't even know if I should leave anymore of a review, if you haven't had In-N-Out yet, you must've been living under a rock!!!\n\nThe only bad thing about this location are the street outlets. One-Way & No Left-Turns... Poopy for you, and I can say this because I am not one of you, crazy-scardy-cat-female-drivers!!! \n\nDrive safe & Eat good!"
0,"Wow. I really hated this place. \n\nOur server was also the bartender. (I ate there last night 1-30-12.) She was either terribly slow or terribly overworked. Either way-- not my problem. She came to the table and gave us a canned speech about \""what she really likes on the menu.\"" Of course, wow, everything she liked numbered amongst \""most expensive\"" on the menu. Big surprise. \n\n(If you read other reviews on Yelp, you can read about the pushy service. Just awful.)\n\nShe talked at us, and not to us. When we were done ordering, she-- in constant sales mode-- pushed the Rice & Peas, which is Jamaican rice and beans. \n\nI love rice & peas, so even though I didn't like our pushy server, I ordered anyway. When the food arrived, my companion and I each took a bite of the rice and-- if I would have had a napkin-- I would have spit it out. \n\nThe flavor could only be described as \""odd\""-- and it was served room temperature. We both agreed- independently of one another-- that the rice was inedible. \n\nGosh, the way our server upsold us, you would think it would be at least edible. \n\nI ordered the soup of the day. I was told it was red snapper with vegetable. It was a fish broth with vegetables. There was no red snapper. So why was \""red snapper\"" included in the title of the soup? I have no idea. \n\nSo they basically boiled some fish heads, put some veggies in, and made $7.25 profit on a $7.50 soup. I was pissed. \n\nOf course, I would have liked to tell our useless server / bartender about this, but she never stopped by to ask us how our meal was-- NOT ONCE. \n\nWhen the food was dropped, we ordered another round of drinks and did not get them until our meal was almost finished. \n\nThe manager came and cleared our plates, so I told him. He just smiled and basically told me it was my fault for not enjoying the overpriced rice and soup. \n\nPlaintains were oven-roasted and tasty. Very stingy portion though.  I would say about half a plaintain per order. These people have their food cost in control baby! Don't serve any food! That's the key.\n\nThe only thing that was good was my companion's jerk chicken. It was excellent, actually. As far as drinks go, the overpriced Mojito Vanilla was also good. \n\nSo here's the deal: If you are a hipster foodie who likes the idea of eating overpriced Jamaican food-- even though you and your knit cap has never even been to Jamaica-- with stingy portions, and poor service...this is your place. \n\nThey missed on every level. Horrible."
1,"I've eaten here probably a dozen times at my frequent stays at the Palazzo. It's a step up from the Cheescake Factory which I hear it is owned by? The chicken and waffles are good, and I love the ahi tuna rolls. I usually eat here for brunch, lunch, or breakfast. I guess whenever I get up. It always hits the spot, and the portions are huge. I'm definately a FAN!"
1,"I didn't notice the perfume everyone on here mentioned that was pumped through the hotel for its ambiance until my friend pointed it out later when we were checking out and I agree it does smell DELICIOUS. SMOKE free. AWESOME. I didn't really care and never really noticed a difference until after the trip. Staff is very welcome and nice. Very accommodating, GYM is on point. I was able to slap my IPOD with the two flat screen tvs. We were upgraded to a view overlooking the entire strip and Bellagio. Pool was nice. Jacuzzi quite small. \n\nOlder clientele. More, older looking folks and business casual. (Personally would've enjoyed seeing more folks my age, but glad no crazy wild young crowds acting crazy!)\n\nGREAT AMENITIES. Housekeeping on point. \n\nBed was very comfortable. Bathroom kind of awkward. There's no actual door so if you're traveling with a friend you will have to kindly slide the shutter when changing, taking a shower, or using the restroom. \n\nThe bathtub pipe was leaking towards the end of the trip so it scared the crap out of it. I did NOT want to use that throughout the trip. \n\nCheck in and check out was breeze. You can actually check out upstairs in your room via the tv screen monitor. \n\nI'd consider going back to stay if there was a deal, however, please note it is quite behind COSMO and you have to walk through the side streets or through the Bellagio to get through everything."
1,"Fancy! =)\n\nWell, I must admit that my husband does know how to pick them. We went here for dinner during our weekend getaway and I was not disappointed. The style and ambiance is very simple and chic. If I may add another word - classy.\nThe service was impeccable! The waiters (we had 3), were so welcoming and genuinely interested in how they could make our stay there memorable. So that's always a big plus for me (i do not like snooty waiters). \nThe food was great! Not the best I've tasted but still up there =). I had the white fish with lump crab and it was delicious! The fish was soft and not chewy at all and the crab definitely complimented the slight saltiness of the fish. Great find!\nThe New orleans bbq shrimp were a tad too salty for my taste, but nevertheless, delicious.\nI would've definitely ordered dessert, but I was so full that I just couldn't get myself to do it. \nIn any case, I had a wonderful time and I must implore you to try it if you are ever at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas (did that sound classy??? eh i tried). Lol.\nBottom line: go for it!"
0,"Omg this place is HORRID! I've never even reviewed a place so low before! \n\nI'm really disappointed Vegas!\n\nSo this has got to be the worst Dim Sum restaurant I've been too. With food and service. Usually service is horrible at dim sum, because its dim sum. They feel the need that they don't need to check up on you, because they have the little ladies with carts going around, and around serving you what you choose. Which isn't that bad.\n\nBut this place... As soon as we got seated, they brought out our water in PLASTIC disposable cups, when everyone else had regular re- used washable cups. How do you run out of cups? Very classy for a \""nice\"" restaurant. And we had also got tea, chrysanthemum tea. As I poured it into my tea cup, I looked in and saw that a bug came out of the pot! It was disgusting! We couldn't even get anyones attention to change it out. Or for them to take it away.\n\nAlso, our Soy Sauce bottle was empty!! They didn't even notice to give us a new one, we had to switch it out with the table next to us.\n\nAnd at last,, the food. It was COLD. Dim sum is suppose to be hot. Steaming hot. But it was so cold, it was breaking apart. Horrible I tell you."
1,"Health conscious organic eaters, you will enjoy this spot! Homemade food, natural sweeteners for coffee, gluten free options, non-dairy options...\nThe owner is very genuine, laid back and kind hearted. \nI totally dig the Nest."
1,"Glad to have this pizza \""to go\"" joint in the neighborhood.  They just opened in May 2012, and I got one of their grand opening special prices for a large pepperoni.\nThey got one of the most important things right: excellent quality cheese and plenty of it!  The sauce was very good, but just a little too spicy.  The regular crust I had was very nice.  Next time, I might try the thin crust, but I will definitely be a regular as long as the quality is there."
0,"This club gave us a very disappointing New Year's Eve experience.  The bouncer guys treated us like kids in school & acted like Nazis maintaining us in lines & behind chain gates which they opened & closed at will & let us through as if they were doing us a huge favor rather than treating us with the courtesy they should have afforded us as the paying customers that we were. They wouldn't  allow us in with bags & told us to check them at the bell desk of the hotel. The hotel wouldn't check our bags & so we ping-ponged back & forth between the surly bouncers & the bell desk until the bell desk took pity  on us & checked our bags. The advertised \""host\"" Bruno Mars, did not make an appearance before midnight so we left without seeing him, which was the reason we went and why we were prepared to pay the $100.00 cover charge.  Very misleading advertising which constituted misrepresentation in my humble opinion & if I was wealthy & litigious I would be talking to counsel as we speak."
0,"Terrible & Dishonest. \n\nMaybe it's my dumb luck but I've had problems with Jiffy before when getting an oil change that it cost me a road trip in which my car ran out of oil because they damaged my gasket amongst other things. I was lucky to make it back home and all they did was deny they did anything wrong.\n\nRegardless, I thought I would give a different location a try and decided to stop here when I noticed I needed a new headlight. I checked in and told the Jiffy employee that my head light went out and if they had the proper bulb if they could fix it. He said, ok and I went into the waiting room. After patiently waiting for 45 minutes they call me back to to my car telling me the electrical wire is the problem and not the bulb. They said I needed to check if it was under warranty with my dealer.  Unfortunate to have to wait all that time just for that simple answer. Never the less I remained pleasant with the workers and thanked them for their time.\n\nLuckily I have a family friend who works at the dealer where I got my car. After explaining to him the problem he got back to later with some interesting information. My headlight casing was cracked and busted recently and the reason he could tell was because upon inspection of the light they found an epoxy that had recently been applied to the damage area for a \""quick fix\"". Another words the \""great\"" employees at Jiffy Lube further damaged my vehicle, made me wait 45 minutes while they hid it  just to lie to my face. \n\nI want you all to think deep down to a time where a dishonest mechanic did you wrong (because let's face it, this happens to everyone at-least once.) and maybe you were not only a victim, but a victim whom to no fault of your own is not in a position for justice; then please I ask you to not patron this establishment out of sheer principle. It's not like there aren't many other business that offer the same services. I apologize for such a negative post but if you look at my history I mainly give 4 & 5 star reviews filled with positivity. I'm not some negative spreading person I just hate seeing good honest people get taken advantage of by dishonest people time and time again."
0,If you go here - go hungry or split a meal.   A breakfast + coffee will probably cost around $25.  It took about 40 minutes to get served after being seated - so don't go if you're in a rush.\n\nThat said the breakfast was delicious and filling.
1,"Ce soir c'\u00e9tait pizza, et le moins que l'on puisse dire c'est que c'est l'endroit pour!!

1,"Me and my boyfriend went on a weekday. Not too busy with a good vibe! Waitress and hostess were very nice. Healthy option menu. He got the dwblta and added an egg. It came with a tomato soup which was equally bomb. I ordered the truffled egg sandwich, hold the shrooms. Was probably the best scramby egg sandwich I ever had. Potatoes I weren't crazy about but that's ok. Loved this place. Would go back again."
0,"How's the food?  Couldn't tell you because it never came out of the kitchen.  We stopped here in July to get some appetizers.  We came in after 9:00 PM and the place was not busy.  After being seated, our waiter pretty much forgot about us because it was about 30 minutes before someone else came by to take our drink orders.  We ordered our food at the same time and, just as we were ordering, our original waiter came back to the table to take over.  We told both waiters that we wanted the portabello mushroom appetizer (they have two mushroom appetizers, the other is stuffed caps).  They both went away and the original waiter came back again to confirm which mushroom appetizer we wanted.  We repeated - portabella.  30 minutes later (we've been here an hour now), out comes someone else with mushroom caps - not what we ordered.  We told him those weren't right and he didn't seem to understand what we were saying.  We called our server over and he saw what was wrong, apologized and took away the food to get the order right.  We're now starving and eating the all the bread at the table - which is grocery store quality by the way.  Spongy and not crusty at all.  After waiting another 30 minutes (now 90 minutes waiting FOR AN APPETIZER), and several visits from our waiter who kept making us feel uncomfortable by being over apologetic, we decided to talk with the manager.  She was nice enough, apologized for the inconvenience and said that we didn't have to pay for anything - so we left.  Over an hour an a half there, no real food (other than bad bread) and bad service.  Our first trip there was our last.  Hope your experience is better.  \n\nOh by the way, if you like GOOD Italian food, this is not the place for you.  You can tell by the bread when a place is good or not (it's not good here) and we could see what others were getting.  This place looks like mid-west American style Italian food.  On par with Olive Garden.  Good luck!"
0,"This place used to be great back in the heyday. Every time I would go on the hunt for gauges in the area (since I used to live relatively close to this location), they always seemed to be out on some sort of make or model of gauges I would want. I've also noticed a lot of their gauges don't come in pairs, and generally are missing or out of stock completely. If you're lucky enough to get a good pair that's discounter it could work to your benefit on saving money, but other than that this location has really fell in business and in service. What was a little aggravating is that the person I talked to in regards of spiral gauges didn't even know what a spiral gauge was or what they looked like. Really, now?\n\nI don't believe you should deserve to work at a tattoo shop if you have no idea what you are talking about or you fail to answer questions that are centered in your department."
0,"The owners Susan and Chris are nice people but they are having some serious business problems which I believe are distracting them.  When I arrived to drop off my dog, Susan and I went over what I brought to feed him (they recommend you supply your own food to avoid gastric problems) and the 2 toys I brought to keep him entertained.  Just to be sure there was no confusion, I also left very simple written instructions about his food and clearly marked everything as well.\n\nWhen I picked the dog up two days later, he was fine, but I discovered none of his food had been given to him and no toy or treat was given to him either!  When I called her back to discuss what went wrong, she apologized and said she apparently misunderstood me.  As I unpacked the little bag I sent with the dog, I realized everything reeked of cigarette smoke--it permeated every single thing I sent with the dog, even his leash and harness!  Looking back, I'm so glad I at least made sure he had his bed and blanket in the pen before I left or he might have been sleeping on the cold floor!  I think they mean well but are caught up with their problems at the moment.  If this could happen when they only had a couple of dogs there, I can't imagine what could go on when they have a full house.  I won't be going back to Small Town Dog."
0,"Great view overlooking the Bellagio fountains if sitting outside. chips and salsa were good. Carnitas platter was decent but nothing special.  the beans were tasty but rice was not impressive at all.  Maybe the food would have tasted better or been more impressive if I was a drinker, but I am not. If your looking for good Mexican food on the strip this is not it.  Keep walking."
1,"I come here for the rice cakes and dessert!! I've tried their wonton noodle, and it was decent. There xlb is ok also! But I enjoy the simple casual atmosphere! The building is a stand alone and you can't miss it ! Service is good too!"
1,"Never say never, I was completely against hot yoga, the thought of being in a stinky sweaty room with other peoples body heat was the last thing on my mind. But right before my Birthday last year I decided to try new things and I am so glad I did.  Not only did I like it, I loved it.  First, it is  great workout, second I feel like I had a massage after the class. Third, staff great especially Serena, I highly suggest taking her class, she is motivational, plays great tunes and will make you smile. If you are new to hot yoga or didn't click with bikram before you give up on it try Sumit."
1,"My husband and I stayed at Vdara over Thanksgiving. We have stayed at the Bellagio for years but the appeal of a non-gaming hotel was too much. We did not regret our choice.\n\nThe room was spacious and well decorated. The room's color scheme was very complimentary and modern. The bed was comfortable. My only complaint is that they only had down like filled pillows. I prefer foam pillows. The furniture was comfortable. The bathroom was spacious. We did not have any issue with noise, with the exception of the loud patron walking down the hall and yelling at his friends. We had a lakeside view  room and could see the Bellagio fountains.\n\nI agree with the reviewer that articulated the relaxing atmosphere of the hotel. I loved the fresh orchids at the front desk. It's a nice change from the hustle and bustle of other hotels. Which, by the way, you can access by walking a few hundred feet to Aria.The hotel has a chic, spa-like vibe throughout.\n\nThe restaurant (only one) has very limited hours. Room service is available 24 hours.\n\nThe entire staff was friendly and helpful. Both bellman were exceptionally friendly and helpful, as were the employees that checked us in and out. \n\nThe walk to the strip means walking through the Bellagio. We are moderate pace walkers and it took us about 10 minutes to get to the strip where you cross at Planet Hollywood.\n\nFor the price, this is the nicest, most luxurious hotel in Vegas."
1,"I LOVE this fun, local restaurant! Cabo is always the #1 place that our family takes out of town friends and family! The servers are friendly , knowledgeable, and quick taking our order, and the food is served hot and delicious. The chipotle corn salsa and the chipotle cheese dip are delicious starters! For a decadent starter, I highly recommend the seafood dish! My favorite dish is 1 mahi mahi taco and 1 shrimp taco with the avocado pasta salad side dish. With a squeeze of fresh lime, the perfect chewiness of the floor tortillas, and the bright flavors of the fish and shrimp--YUM! I could go there right now! :)"
1,"I really like this bank, the staff is friendly and always take care of what I need.  I hate talking through the glass with bank tellers, and that is never a problem here. The design is nice and when I walk in its easy to relax, and then everyone is nice and they smile.  This is the best banking experience I have had.  We now have our personal and business accounts with Midfirst bank."
0,"JET SUCKS--not good hip hop at all: I came here with my boyfriend for New Years Eve to party for the New Year as well as a belated birthday for me.  We paid $150 per ticket that claimed \""VIP\"" however we standed in the regular line for over an hour trying to get in.  I thought we were going to spend the  NY in the hallway of the hotel. Aagghh.  We finally got in, not sure what the long wait was...  Lesson to club- dont claim VIP if its the same as the normal line.\n\nOnce inside, I started to feel sick for some reason.  I hadnt drank anything yet but felt real hot and dehydrated.  I felt like I was going to pass out and needed water fast.  The bar lines were crazy long so I asked my BF to go to the side of the bar and tell the waitress I was sick and needed water. Of course we would have tipped her well.  She screamed at him, \""the line is in front of the bar, you need to go there!!\""  WTF.  I was about to pass out and she didnt give a shit.  So much for compassion.  After about 45 mins of me barely hanging on, he came back with water.  I drank it and felt much better no thanks to the staff there! They sucked!!!\n\nThen we made our way to the dance floor. It was packed and crowded. It was NY's so hey I was trying to deal with it.  There are these raised platforms with stripper poles for girls to dance on.  Everyone kept laying their drinks on it while the girls were dancing so drinks kept falling off onto the floor, all over my pants and shoes.  By later that night there must have been 50+ drinks on that thing, no one never came to clean it up.  Also, does every fat chick have to get on that thing?  If you weigh over 160, dont get up there!!\n\nOkay so it must be me but if you are in a crowded club you dont dance BIG.  Meaning you 2 step side to side, groove a little.  I almost punched like 20 girls and dudes in the damm face.  I was constantly pushed, elbowed in the back HARD, hit in the head, etc...  WTF.   Trust me, Im not all stuck up and used to crowds but some respect for each other please people.\n \nThe DJ sucked.  He would play 2 hip hop songs, had the crowd hype and then would play some wack sh_t and stop the floor.  Cant you see this?  What are you looking at while DJ'ing?  The people wanted hip hop, they were jamming and then you switch up??  WTF  --- again cant you see this?\n\nThe place was big, had 2 bars I saw.  \n\nI didnt like it at all. If I never have to go back thats fine with me."
0,"Fremont Street seems like a place the \""kids\"" might enjoy.. Not really much going on that's actually cool. Just a lit/screen roof, ziplining, music, and stores/casinos along both sides of the street. Maybe my expectations were too high (although I'm not too sure what exactly I had expected to see), but it wasn't really much of an \""experience\"", you can pretty much see everything there is to see in about 30 minutes.\n\nAfter walking through Fremont Street, you should head to the downtown area bars which are, unlike Fremont, really cool. I LOVE Insert Coin(s)!"
1,Ron does great work
0,"I was drawn in here by the promise of coffee and pastries and the 10% student discount advertised on the window outside. Inside, the counter is full of costly cakes that look absolutely delicious, however at \u00a32-\u00a33 a slice, I would advise holding off until after 3pm, when all cakes, pastries and rolls are half price. \n\nThis place has a kind of Mystic Pizza feel to it, with the sisterly looking waitresses serving up traditional Italian fare, with a radio belting out power ballads in the background. The floors are tiled and the traditional wooden tabled are spotlessly clean. \n\nThe coffee was hot strong and tasty and the shortbread I had with it was sugary, sweet and very nice indeed. The only thing I could complain about would be the prices, at around \u00a33 for a takeaway sandwich and an alarming \u00a32.50 for a variety pack size box of cereal that I doubt Tony the tiger would find grrreat."
1,We were a party of 8 taking our grandparents out for a special celebration. Even though we didn't make a reservation we were seated promptly. They have a great wine selection. Their food menu has a wide selection as well. We each ordered something different off the menu and everything was just scrumptious!! I had the seared Ahi tuna and my husband had the pork tenderloin. Both were phenomenal. Service was impeccable and friendly. It was a bit dark but over all it was a great lil find!
0,Went here for lunch the other day since it is close to work. I ordered a grilled chicken ranch wrap. Got a fried chicken wrap with honey mustard. Chicken was fatty and gross but I should have expected that I guess. Not trying that again
1,"For a special occasion, there is no better place to go than this great Lebanese restaurant. The owners are such wonderful people. They always recognize your and your family when you come in to visit - even if it's only a few times a year. There is always the lamb special - leg of lamb stuffed with a blend of rice, pine nuts, and almond slivers roasted for 5-7 hours until it's falling off the bone. The lamb is served on a bed of the rice and has SO much flavor. My father always enjoys the lamb shank - in a beautiful tomato-based sauce. The meat is always tender and scrumptious.\n\nI almost forgot to mention the soup! If you are lucky enough to get there on a night when they have the tomato soup, DO IT! The lentil is also quite tasty, however. Don't forget dessert...they make a delightful pudding with rosewater and sprinkled with crushed pistachios and drizzled with honey. Oh man..."
0,"Is this a chain restaurant? I honestly have no idea. \n\nLet me start off by saying this. This is the best pizza in Uptown. With that said, the pizza is just okay. \n\nIt's a shame that there's really not good pizza in Charlotte. The Hawaiian pie is okay. The cinnamon-knots are the best thing on the menu.\n\nIf you NEED pizza, I'd go there. Other than that, don't go out of your way."
0,"I think it's quite possible that McAlister's Deli may be the most overrated deli I have ever been to... ever.  Each time I go there (which isn't often), I leave feeling like I have somehow been ripped off.  I think their food is overpriced for the quality that you get and that's what irritates me about this place.  Maybe I just haven't been getting the right menu items but last weekend, I had a greek chicken wrap that was bland and full of nothing but lettuce.  The \""feta cheese\"" in the wrap was either not truly feta or some really, really low quality stuff.  It had a mealy, gross texture and no saltiness to it at all.  Maybe it was goat cheese, but it didn't even taste like that either.  I dunno...I\""m just not fan and I would much rather go to Panera, Sub Station, or Owen's.  Oh and everyone raves about their sweet tea, but c'mon now, this is North Carolina...you can get sweet tea on every corner."
1,"Holy amazing christ. This is the best buffet I've ever been to. It's expensive, yeah, but mind-blowing. The selection is huge, and VERY vegetarian friendly (I think that the owner is a a vegan, or something, so there are a lot of vegetarian and vegan options). Plus there's a pasta bar. Where you pick your pasta, pick your sauce, pick your ingredients... Oh man.\nForget the gambling, come to Vegas to go to this place; arrive for breakfast, and stay until dinner to get your money's worth."
1,Great place in town!!!
0,"Food was just ok. The eggplant I found really good. But when asking questions about the menu, the server didnt know how to help at all. She barely spoke english and was confused when asking if we could get beef instead of chicken with ramen. She then suggested beef noodles. It didnt have ramen though, we didnt know that. My friend didnt really like its texture that much. \n\nWe ordered a soju alcoholic drink. It was good but when we ordered another one, the server came back 15 minutes later and said that the manager made the last drink, she didnt know how to make it and she wasnt sure if the manager was coming back. \n\nI did like the hot pot, i thought it was spicy and adding extra toppings werent expensive\n\nWe ordreed a side of beef tongue which we were pretty sure it had a bad smell.\n\nAlthough I thought the hot pot was good, I probably will be very hesitant to come back because of all the other entrees and the restaurant's service."
1,"Some of the best food that I have had.  We each tried a different pasty - every one was superb.  They were flavorful and crusty.  The meat and cheese pasty and the chicken pot pie pasty were especially tasty.  The atmosphere was what I would imagine a pub to be!  The reason for the 4 rating was because of the service!   We seemed to wait forever for the food , and the waitresses seemed to disappear for long stretches.  The first waitress we had was bitchy, but the second one seemed sweet!  We eat out a lot and know good service - this was not it!  The person from the kitchen that brought our chips did apologize for the wait.  It even took long for drink refills!  Too bad because the food was great!"
0,"Very bad promotions, for those who get offers which I do but not really participate( play $30 get $5), and funny how they have another promo that says ( play $20 get $10 in fsp) but cannot use  if you get Sept offers, which is so lame.. Therefore I will spend my money elsewhere, not here at LV Westgate.. I really doubt there marketing dept. reads this But I must say the players club has always been very nice, and slot machines are tight here."
1,"This was the 2nd stop on our buffet of buffets tour, and I must say it was a pleasant surprise! My expectations were kinda low after reading the reviews on here, and the intent was to only grab a snack. That turned into 2 plates. Their sushi was really good, my brother and I made 2 big plates of nachos and split them, the other Asian selections were tasty, and it was a pretty good variety overall. I stayed away from the crab and heavy meats since this was only supposed to be a snack before hitting the Rio a few hours later, but my appetite ended up getting hijacked here. I am curious to try their brunch, especially knowing it can't be worse than Planet Hollywood's. There was also no line here at like 5pm on Saturday evening. The service wasn't bad, especially since the staff displayed a sense of humor joking around with us several times during our meal. Overall, I'd say this is still 3rd of the 4 we went to, but I would definitely come back."
0,"On a recent visit we requested a non-smoking room. There were NO non-smoking rooms available but there were many smoking rooms available. We were told to come back to the desk in one hour and a room would be cleaned. After 1.5 hours I returned. Nothing cleaned. Was offered an upgrade for $20.00 / night. After traveling all day and being exhausted I was too tired to argue. Next day tried to persuade management to split the cost of the upgrade since I was not responsible for them not having my room cleaned.  Management wouldn't hear of it and told me that requesting a non-smoking was only a request and that they didn't  have to offer me a non-smoking room.  The upgraded suite was dirty. When you turned on the water the  pipes rattled loudly.  I called for housekeeping to bring extra towels, they never arrived. My 30+ trip to Vegas, never to stay in this dump again."
1,"This is such a fun little store.  I really love coming in here, the people are friendly, their stuff is awesome, and they have a clearance section!  Boom!\n\nThey have a fabulous selection of everything paper, from invitations to gift wrapping.  They've got you covered for every holiday and event.  (I have browsed this beautiful section, but am yet to have a real need for customized invites)\n\nYou'll find me in the gifts section, looking at everything from whiskey stones to cupcake banners.  \""Why cupcake banners?\"" You ask.\n\n\""WHY NOT CUPCAKE BANNERS?!\"" I politely answer.  This is how I wander around this store.  It's fabulous, and ridiculous.  Occasionally over-priced.  But that's why you'll also find me in the clearance section - trying to rationalize an orange glass plate with an anchor on it.... Why not?"
1,"We have been going to the paradise valley Picazzo's since it opened and it is one of my favorite places for lunch or dinner, any day.  The salads are exceptional, and the pasta (especially the mushroom!) and pizzas are wonderful.  I like the fact that it is organic, and that you can pretty much design what you want.  The servers (with one remote and fortunately gone exception) are very responsive.  This place is successful for good reason.  I hope it remains open for a long, long time."
0,Use to be the BEST in town\nNow the FIRST PLACE is BACCHANAL at caesar palace\nI do not recommend anymore the buffet\nYou would be dIsappointed\nWe could have thought that after beeing so good they would have make a special effort at the apperance of bacchanal\nIt is the contruary\nChinese food is not varied and no good\nMeat is very poor\nPizzas are awfull\nSalads and vegetables with no taste\nDeserts are a d\u00e9solation\nIce cream a joke \nUsed to be a huge fan no more !!!
1,"While visiting Glendale,  I stumbled into this lovely cafe. The owner is fantastic and so welcoming. For my first meal, I ordered the turkey avocado sandwich and I added bacon. It was delicious and the bread toasted with Parmesan butter was a nice touch. On my second trip to this restaurant, I ordered a breakfast sandwich and iced coffee. I love that the breakfast menu allows for custom orders."
0,"The services was slow......But his runner did lot of the runners but after our waiter take our bill, he never came back to see is we anything more.\nThe steak was over cook, nor favorite and was a tough meat. We were celebrating our 11yrs wedding anniversary. No one wish us or make it special on our special event."
1,"The mama's spinach thin crust pizza is awesome! I never seen my wife eat so much pizza! Great garlic flavor, sauce is tasty!"
1,My friend lives right around the corner and after a little shopping we decided to stop in and grab some food. She ordered a turkey wrap and I got the turkey bacon melt. Both were made when we ordered it and were ready in about 3 minutes. Mine was perfectly hot and the flavor was excellent. Gotta show support for local business!!
0,"Note to self - yelp has a mobile app, use it!\nI wish I would have read the reviews for this place before stopping in for lunch but I was in the area and figured a chain couldn't be bad. Ha!\n\nA sign told us to seat ourselves so we did. A server stopped by and asked if we wanted something to drink. We all ordered but I almost had to argue with the server to get a root beer. She told me it was from the tap and was $4.50; she said this like she was trying to talk me out of it but she did add that I would get free refills. Ha! More on this later. She didn't give us menus and left for about five minutes. When she returned she brought menus but forgot the straws so she disappeared again. I should note that there were three servers for six occupied tables.\n\nWe finally got to order. I had the parmesan chicken sandwich. It was pretty bland. I got potato salad for a side, also bland. I tried the Philly Cheesesteak and, yep - bland. I also tried the fries. They were OK.\n\nThe server never did stop by to see if everything was OK or to refill our drinks. I waited patiently for my check and finally got up and hunted her down. She was chatting with the other servers. I got my check, paid cash so I wouldn't have to spend any more time and left. On the way out I noticed a sign that said we were entitled to a free dessert. Someone might want to mention it to the server.\n\nOverall, bland food, terrible service and an expensive root beer."
0,"This was my first time eating here. The food was very bland and uninspired. However, the drinks were very tasty. Our server was not the worst. But, definitely not the best. However, the manager was excellent. She came and asked how everything was. When I replied that it was just OK, she wanted details. The manager was very appreciative of my feedback and even took my fish tacos off of the check (something I did not expect). Also, they accidentally charged my card too much. The manager that I spoke to was very concerned and understanding. He even went to their accounting department to verify that their records only showed the correct charge. Although my first experience with the food was not great, I am considering giving them another shot thanks to the excellent managers."
0,"No good. \nI went with a friend because she heard the pizza was good. - it's alright.\n\nThe guy bar tending hated his life. And his job. He was making sure we knew that. \n\nIt was SO DEAD. We were the only ones there, along with our sleeping bartender.\n\nWe won't be returning, go to stieners!"
0,When I'm hungry for Italian...\n\n... I see the Martorano's billboard and lose my appetite.
1,"I am going to pay for this meal, but I don't care.  I will run a few extra miles because it was so worth it.  My shawarma chicken was to die for.  The chicken was marinated to perfection.  I also had a side of baba ganoush, omg, so delicious. I also ended up eating half of my hubby's lentil soup.   I wish I had enough space for the spanakopita.  I had the baklava \""to go\"" for later.  It didn't even make it to I 17.  It was freaking delicious, the honey and pistachios were so prevalent in the taste.  I am still dreaming about it.  I also shopped for a few items at the market.  What a cool place.  Can't wait to take the hike back to the west side."
0,"Horrible customer service!!\nI understood first time, but this is second time. \nThey were working like a robot. No server smiled at all, and they seemed like they were trying not to see other tables while they were working.\nNo one checked our table even though there were a few  servers. Our side dishes were empty 20minutes ago, but still no server came. The restaurant didn't seem to be busy (only about 10 tables) but the servers were busy.  All they care was a table with a big check so they can get a big tip. If you are going this restaurant only for dinner, you will be unwelcomed and treated like beggers."
0,Oh Foodie Fest! How you broke my heart this year! \n\nI have been in past years and was used to the idea of paying $10 to get in and then pay the trucks for their Food Truck ambrosia delights at their regular full prices. I won't spend a lot of time on the cost factor but will mention the trucks should make smaller portions at reduced prices so those people like myself can try a little bit of everything. \n\nThis year I have to give props to the Slap Yo Mamma truck and their gator tacos. They were delicious! \n\nFukuburger a normal 5 star truck disappointed us by serving our Burgers bloody and under cooked on the first night. 2nd day the Burgers were cooked to perfection but then they were out of Naga Dogs. It was the first time we were ever disappointed with this truck.\n\nThe daughter loved the fried candy station. Don't know how she lives with me and I never exposed her to deep fried Reese's peanut butter cups or Twinkies but we had to get back in line for more of those.\n\nWe also couldn't find fried pickles anywhere...where oh where were you Redneck Kitchen?\n\nRides were a little expensive but still the best part of the foodie fest. How sad is that? You are at a food truck fest and the sub par/over priced rides were the best part of the event?\n\nAll in all it was a horrible experience this year and I hope the Silverton brings back the group that put it on in years past as this year they failed miserably in my humble opinion.
0,"The previous reviewers must be out of their mind.  This was the worst restaurant i have ever been to.  \nInquired about some martinis but the waiter looked puzzled and unsure, so settled on Amstels and a pomegranate martinis which tasted like moonshine.\nStarted with the table-side caesar salad for 2.  Disgusting: the lettuce was lacking in  romaine hearts, and  was actually wilted.  next was the crab cakes-WAS NOT EDIBLE we both could not finish it.  For the main we got the sole and ribeye.  Sole tasted like a tv-dinner and the steak ($80) was full of gristle and fat.\nAfter the main they bring a giant fruit bowl, which was probably from a previous table.  Not sliced fruit, but whole fruits.  WTF?!  Ouside, we burst out laughing and agreed it was the worst dining experience we have ever had.  So bad we couldnt even get mad.\nThe bill was $380.00 for 2 and left a 15% tip."
0,"I have been here multiple times. When it first opened years ago it was great, but since then the service and outcome has been less than great. The car often has spots missed being cleaned on both the exterior and the interior. I had just moved back a couple weeks ago and decided to finally get my car cleaned-especially vacuumed-so I went here because it was the one I knew and noticed it was still open so I thought I would give them another chance. When I asked them to make sure they did a thorough vacuum job, I was informed they could not get \""that out\"" of the seats-the \""that\"" he was referring to was dog and cat hair because I just moved with them for a 2500 mile road trip. Any high powered vacuum should be able to remove pet hair thus this should not have been an issue. I explained it was just pet hair and would come out-it wasn't a stain. The guy proceeded to tell me their vacuums cannot remove pet hair. So-final analysis-poor workmanship on cleaning the car and their vacuums are admittedly the least effective in the business. I do not recommend this car wash."
1,"This was my first hookah experience!  But since I'm more about food, let me start there!\n\nChicks on your grill ... grilled chicken and rice.  A little bland, especially after eating the Cry Baby Curry!  OMG this was so delish!! In fact, we came here twice while in Vegas and I ordered it both times.  The hummus and pita ... again, delish!\n\nThe first time here we had some sort of mint hookah.  It was good but after a while, gave me a stomach ache.  LOL.  Next time I should eat before I smoke hookah.  The 2nd time we were here, we had double apple ... it was really good but again, got a stomach ache for just a short bit.  LOL.  What a sissy!"
0,"Wife, myself and another couple had dinner tonight at legume. After ordering nice bottle of Spanish wine (a blended red) and studying menu we elected to have the 5 course (meat) tasting menu. None of us could be described as hearty eaters, but at $55 per person the portions were exceedingly small. The desserts were as large as 2 of the other courses. Presentation was nice and overall food was good. We have eaten all over the country and in many countries overseas in very fine restaurants and so I am not trying to compare with 5 star restaurant. With this said, they could be a little more generous with portions."
0,"After wandering around Planet Hollywood, we stumbled upon this place for some quick and dirty food. We got seated (with a wide open restaurant may I add as well as patio) between a pole and group of 6. We ordered some burgers, which were lack luster but did the trick for any hangover. The drinks (3.99 blood marys) were mehhh. For 3.99 in Vegas I expected stronger, but nope! Would take about 15 of these to get you any sort of feeling. Straight spice and Tomato juice. Regardless the food was just ok, but the service was good enough aside from seating. Which earns this place my rating!"
0,"1-Star service is what you get when you try to escape the prices of the nice, fancy hotel spas.  \n\nMy girlfriend & I wanted a mani & pedi, but we didn't want to pay the $115 that The Wynn Spa was charging.  So we went across the street to the mall for a more reasonable price of $70.\n\nThey were so nice there, we just assumed they were doing a good job.  Every single nail was crooked.  When I went to pay, I noticed and made her refile my fingers so they were even and presentable.  After sitting under the dryer for over 10 mintues and getting quick-dry spray, every single nail managed to smudge or chip.\n\nIt was truly the worst manicure & pedicure I've ever had.  Do not go to this place!"
0,"I only give it a second star because I like the atmosphere, seating and cozy/social feel.  I also liked that the waitress walks you through the kitchen to get to your table.\n\nThat was the upside.  Here is the downside.  As you can tell from other reviews it is very pricey.  If you are looking for good Italian kitchen family style food you must go to Maggiano's, 5 star and you get a ton more food for the same price as this joint.  The service tonight was slow and I didn't expect that since we came in after the rush.  The waitress seem experienced but she only pretended to care.  She seem as if she could not be bothered by us even after we introduced ourselves as first time customers.\n\nWe ordered the Chicken Limone and it was very dry.  Enough said.  The spicy chicken (insert your favorite little Italian pasta name here) was pretty good. \n\nMy wife asked what I thought and I said it was okay but I wouldn't exactly come running back."
0,"I REALLY wanted to like this place!  Good location, good sports decor, large cheap pitchers, and bar sports (pool, darts, foosball, scuffle board), but alas, I did not.\n\nI have to agree with some (most) of the other Yelpers when I say the service was subpar.  Usually I can handle poor service if the food is decent (I know, I know, it's bar food) but even for bar food, it wasn't very enjoyable.  I mean, HOW on EARTH do you mess up a cheese crisp and chicken tenders?!?    \n\nWe may go back for a late night foosball game and a health dose of beer, but as far as dinner, drinks and sports.... I sadly say, head across the street to Zipps."
1,Favorite place here in town and great prices!!
1,"This place has a top notch tuna tataki app! Great rolls out quick regardless of how busy they are. Excellent service all the way around and very reasonable on price. Green tea ice cream for after dinner treat, I think so!!!! I forgot to mention I was in and out during lunch time spending 20 dollars."
0,"Absolutely terrible service. Would definitely give 0 stars if it was possible. After having 4 new tires put on, we noticed the car was shaking, so we took it back to have them fix the problem that they caused. After making us wait an hour, they told us that their balancing? machine was not working properly, and needed to be calibrated. There were others there with me who had the same problem, and we were all told to come back in a week. \nFast forward a week, I called to make an appointment to make sure that the machine was working and so we wouldn't have to wait there while they fixed the problem. They set me up with an appointment and told me I would be in and out. The next day when I arrived at my appointment time, I was turned away and told that the machine had still not been calibrated. How can they be putting tires on other vehicles safely for a whole week if the machine is still not working? Frank, the manager, had nothing to say besides offering free oil changes, but why would I want to ever again entrust my car to a shop who clearly cares nothing about the quality of their work?\nI will never spend a dollar here again, and recommend that you look elsewhere when you need any tire or vehicle services."
1,"macaroni pizza! salad! desserts! pretty cheap buffet, great, enthusiastic service and clean, kid-friendly place."
1,"Was there for lunch today with a friend, got lucky there was only a couple of people infront of us.\n\nThe food came fast, and it was delicious....Started with the Kim Chi tofu Salad which was Great. We then had the Shrimp Burger which was out of this world Amazing and the 24-Hour Pork bowl was was also delicious.\n\nWe split a home-made caramel ice cream for dessert which was also very tasty.\n\n\nThe price is also very reasonable about 15 bucks a person\nGoing back for sure, maybe even for supper tonight"
1,great place to visit. food were really good but our server was a kind of mean. still give em 4 stars because of food.
0,"Blech. I expected so much more from Wicked Spoon based on reviews and recommendations from friends, and left disappointed. \n\nOne upside: the service was great, and our server was attentive and friendly. \n\nNow the downsides: for one of the supposed \""top tier\"" buffets in Vegas, the lack of selection was surprising. Yes, there are crab legs, but you can find those at any buffet in Vegas nowadays. Yes, there was bone marrow - the thing I was looking most forward to! - but for each bone you could get maybe a quarter teaspoon of marrow. And yes, the ice cream was delicious, but I was too busy scraping the remnants of the stalest macaron that I've ever eaten off the roof of my mouth to enjoy it much.\n\nI imagine that the appeal of Wicked Spoon lies in how they've covered their bases by including all of the \""fan favourites\"" of the Vegas buffets: the aforementioned crab legs, fried chicken in cute baskets, a carving station, mac and cheese, etc. So, if you've never tried any other buffet in Vegas, you will probably be satisfied. However, once you try any other buffet, you'll realize that it's missing a lot of things that might not be as novel or cute, but are nonetheless key to a good buffet: veggies (cooked or raw), fruit (of any kind), and international cuisine selections beyond a few types of sushi and some nachos and salsa. Not to mention that we were told that the fresh pasta station only had cream sauce, the soup of the day had run out, and instructed to use taco shells as nacho chips as they had also run out of those (mind you, the buffet was not busy when we went either). \n\nAnd the macaron! That hideous macaron! It had the taste and consistency of a mint that I had left in my purse for months and forgotten about. \n\nFor the regular $39/person for dinner, this was already not worth your money or time. For the $47/person \""holiday\"" pricing, this was inexcusable. Do yourself a favour and head to the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars instead."
1,"The wait and line can seem intimidating but I finally went to Farmhouse for Sunday brunch. The wait was 15 min, no big deal. If there's nobody outside,  write your name and party number on the clipboard outside to get your name down on the list. We went inside and the restaurant is so charming but small. Tables get turned quickly. We were seated in a booth and given a menu with one side breakfast and one side lunch. I went with the Belgian waffle and my fiance had the #18 scrambler. Food came out quickly and portions are just right. Food was decent, I thought my fiance's food was better than my waffle. Prices are good, much better than other breakfast options nearby. I would come again."
0,"Not a secure place....used ATM there and got identity stolen.  This was the only place we used our card.  After contacting the Mirage....they said \""what do u expect us to do about it\""?  Really...that's how much u care about ur patrons.  Won't be back after that!  They wouldn't even help with a police report.\n\nTerrible consideration!"
0,"Was included in the baby consignment listings when doing a search on yelp (app and mobile).\n\nI certainly do not consider 1 rack maybe 4-5 foot long of baby clothes a place I want to even bother going to in search of baby items (unless maybe I'm looking for vintage baby clothes). Also, way overpriced if you ask me. \n\nHowever, if you're looking for vintage clothes/shoes/etc... This is a decent place to start..kinda. Though when I was full on in my rockabilly phase, there were far better places to go in search of clothes (A Goodwill store being the first stop). \n\nOn another note, the gal working when we went in the other day seemed more interested in playing with her phone than engaging us, her potential customers."
1,"This place is amazing!!! The flavorful combinations of spices are like nothing I have ever experienced.  Every dish is so unique and flavorful!!   All the other reviews say enough I just had to add my 5 stars.  This place is amazing and I will not ever leave Vegas without eating here.  The staff is amazing,  it is quite intimate for being such a busy place, and the food is exquisite!! \n\nYou must try this place!!"
0,"I purchased a groupon and visited the Teriyaki Boy restaurant on 10/17/12.  \n\nMy first impression was the food smelled good and the restaurant was clean.  The person taking my order, adult female, was very short with me and less then helpful.  \n\nI ordered a chicken bowl with brown rice and vegetables.  The brown rice and vegetables were good, the chicken however was over cooked to the point that it was difficult to chew.  \n\nI felt like I was eating beef jerky without the flavor.  I will not return to this restaurant."
0,"This is a NOISY, DIRTY UN-FRIENDLY store! Sure it has all the same items every other Dollar Tree has, but the \""cheap\"" isn't worth it! Long lines, surly staff always clogged with boxes and trash and it takes too much of my time and energy dealing with it all! i live within walking distance of this store-i have \""switched\"" to a Dollar Tree i must drive to because it is CLEAN, CALM and the staff are really NICE. No longcheck-out lines and i find everything i need/want, without \""attitude\"" and filth."
0,"Blech! Can you just say this is pure disgust? There pho broth tastes so bland that I might just as well have water as broth with my pho. On top of it shitty service does really accompanies with their food quality.   The lady owner is such a b-i-t-c-h she was taking my order, and giving me attitude when I was asking about the sizes.  Crappiest Pho place I ever been to in my life!!"
1,Yummy is my yummy neighborhood sushi place. \nThe fish is so fresh it's still flapping in your mouth. The food is just great with top notch service. \nAnd it's open till 1am. I love this yummy joint.
0,I'm not sure why everyone raves about this steakhouse.  We have had better food - just across the street.  Our server was great but the food can only be described as mediocre.  The tomato and onion salad consisted of huge slices of under-ripe tomatoes and huge hunks of hot onion that no one could eat.  The rib-eye was OK but not spectacular.  I can name two dozen other steakhouses in Phoenix and Las Vegas that far surpass the food here.  Hopefully we were there on a bad night but we don't plan to give it a second chance--not for the prices charged.
0,"Never understood all the hype about this place. The burgers are rather bland and burnt.  No fries, only their potato things which are NOT as good as any fry I have ever had.  And the wait was always ridiculous to boot.\n\nI admittedly haven't been here in a few years, but it doesn't seem like this is the type of place that would have changed."
1,"Nice sandwich selection with fresh ingredients. Side salad has lots of tomatoes, carrots onions...very nice, not your standard skimpy side salad. Staff was very friendly and patient. Great little airport sandwich shop."
1,"Fresh Chinese food, good prices. This place is very similar to Pei Wei. The meal was very good. I would definitely go again."
1,"I had the pleasure to meet Dave and Rich at their office this week. What impressed me most is their knowledge of the industry and their customer service oriented business model.  Their personal approach carries through the way they do business... nurturing business relationships, asking for personal referrals, and giving a customer undivided attention at the appointment.\nI met both gentlemen at a networking event and was intrigued about the business model of not having a store front.  Now that I understand it better, I have to say it's the way to go!"
1,Service was wonderful and the food matched. Really High quality fish and they made our anniversary special! The kobe meatball was also fabulous as the one thing we tried beyond sushi. We would definitely go back. The bread pudding was a nice balance with sushi too!
0,"When this please first opened it was good, but they have gone downhill since the beginning.  Plus there are way more better burgers places than indulge.  This place the prices are too high for the food you get and the burgers are nothing to write home about, very boring.  Yes they have buffalo but so does most other places.  Yes they have a gluten free menu but so does many other places.  The turkey burger and the buffalo burgers we tried were boring and dry.  Plus the sweet potatoe fries tasted like them came out of a bag rather than being made from scratch.  We will not be returning, they are no longer a good value and the food is not longer great but boring."
1,"This place wasn't as hard to find as I had imagined. Many of the employees at Cosmo were very helpful in pointing out the directions along the way. The inside reminded me a lot of NYC's pizzerias and they even had those ancient arcade games you hardly ever see anymore.\n\nThough the line wasn't too bad (I came here for lunch), the price for a slice of pizza was a pretty penny. I think ~$5-6 for a slice is a bit pricey, but ordering the whole pizza isn't that much cheaper either, considering the # of toppings.\n\nThe texture of my pizza was crispy and thin, I loved it. I ordered the combo slice with all the toppings. Overall, it was delicious, and a great place to stop by with friends."
1,Juicy steaks !!!  Love sitting outside in early summer and watching the people.
1,"I stayed here long ago and hadn't been back because I had heard the property was worn. Well, if so, they must have had a face lift. Check in was flawless, room was large and very clean. Nice small gym and you don't have to walk through a casino to get to your room. Plus you can park close. Many guests were foreigners. Close to the strip, (if you're driving and who goes to Vegas in the Summer without a car?!) A nice inexpensive stay at a very nice property. Recommended!"
0,"Heard so many good things about this place and its prime rib steak that I was disappointed. My cousins are always saying that the prime rib steak is amazing.\n\nI had it but it was far too salty. I later found out that I should have had it cooked in the \""slow roasted\"" method but went for Outback Style - basically peppery. It was very salty and very peppery. I tried someone elses Prime Rib steak which was cooked in \""right\"" way and it was OK - nothing to write home about.\n\nAlso, heard that the bread they give you was brilliant too. Just tasted like normal bread with slightly different (to England anyway) butter."
1,"I had to try it....\n\nNice place tucked in a strip mall right near Rays Pizza and Discount Tire. \n\nIt seats more then it looks like it can but the decor is comfortable. They are nice and friendly, seem to know the regulars, and appreciate the new folks too. \n\nI had the special of the day. Roast Beef in a French Bread roll, hot, with horeseradish mayo, pepperchenies, red onion and rare roast beef sliced with sharp cheddar melted over the top. Served with Homemade potatoe salad and a pickle. It also comes with a cookie for desert. \n\nThey serve breakfast and lunch, and was told the breakfast is awesome. They have Coke \""on tap\"" and everything else in a cooler. Yep even Mt Dew. \n\nMy only gripe is i could not afford to eat here everyday."
1,"I wish I could give half stars because I truly want to give Delta's a 3.5, but to fair I will round up to 4. \n\nThe atmosphere is absolutely fantastic. For the listening pleasure of patrons, a live band plays in the evenings daily. Also, on Tuesdays they offer great drink specials where the menu listings are creations of the skilled bartenders. Yum!\n\n\nThere are two reasons why I give Delta's a 3.5:\n\n#1: Service: The waitress/waiters are very cordial. But it takes an unacceptable amount of time for the food to be delivered from the kitchen. We waited over a hour for our dishes to arrive, and when they did, they were cold.  :(\n\n#2: The Food: The food is good and has major potential, but is not at its best when served cold. Also, for the price (~$20-$30 per plate) I'd expect more flavor and distinction.\n\n\nGiven the atmosphere, live music, and drinks, I'd say that Delta's is a great place for a date or a group outing. However, be weary of the long wait for your main course. Perhaps your experience will be better than mine. It's definitely worth a try!"
1,"The 4 stars are for the Tequila bar. Located in Treasure Island, Isla has HH everyday from 4-7 PM and offers discounted prices on beer and cocktails. Also, the bartenders are extremely helpful and even let you sample different tequilas that they personally recommend.\n\nThey have a HUGE tequila menu but I would chat with the bartenders, specifically Teri, and ask for recommendations. Do you really want to sit at the bar and read a 30 page book? Depending on your price range and taste, they can suggest one to your potential liking.\n\nYou can either sit at the bar or on one of the small couches adjacent to the casino.\n\nThe restaurant food is another story. I would solely come here for HH or the Tequila bar. Their guacamole is extremely fresh and full of flavor but that's about it. The tacos were sub par, especially for Vegas. I really regret not trying Roberto's Taco Shop, which our taxi driver complimented.\n\nIf you like tequila that has a soft caramel finish, try Frida Kahlo."
1,"Finally checked this place out after \""fan\""-ing them on facebook months ago.  \n\nI must say I really like the feel in this location. The staff was really nice and attentive without being pushy or obnoxious. \n\nIt really seemed like the type of place where you could come in with your friends and pop out of the dressing room to get the whole store's opinion on your outfit.  It was fun and hip, but not pretentious. Feels like a place you would find in a smaller town, laid back, place where everyone knows your name, type place. I must say this is a huge perk in the middle of a big city.\n\nI really enjoyed that they had a wide variety of sizes, making this a place all body shapes can feel comfortable.  \n\nThey seem to be big on sales which is one of my favorite words, in fact on the day I came in my receipt had a coupon for their other location on the bottom of it... Hello Marketing GENIUS!\n\nI'd be back for sure. High quality, brand names and amazing prices without the funky thrift store smell! Hello reasonably priced boutique store love!"
1,"I've been to LBS twice now, most recently 2 weeks ago on a Friday night.  If you have a larger group like we did (there were 5 of us), you can usually expect to have to wait for a table -- our wait was 45 minutes.  But it gave us time to work up our appetites :)\n\nI think the burgers here are pretty good -- they're HUGE! My favorite is the smokehouse burger, smothered in BBQ sauce, cheese, onion rings and bacon.  I tried the turkey burger, which was super moist, and got a wheat bun (it's nice to have a choice).  Fries are decent (not as good as Smashburger though, I'll admit) and the burgers are served with a very generous amount of fries on the side.  For $12, you definitely get a lot of food!\n\nOur server was really friendly and attentive and our food came exactly as ordered, which was great because when I say no pickles, I really mean NO pickles :) \n\nOverall, this place is a good choice when you're in the mood for a burger; they have some unique burgers on the menu and a variety of non-burger items as well.  The atmosphere is energetic (partly because it's in the casino) but the masculine interior still feels kind of cozy since the restaurant isn't that big.  I'm sure I'll be back to LBS again and hope you try it too!"
0,This location is gone.
1,"This place gets a solid 5 stars for the atmosphere and history. The live rock music also gets this place onto my list of favorites. From the decor to the bar specials, so many things here make Long Wong's a Valley icon.\nThat said, the food is really good too. The burgers, wraps, subs, and hot dogs are all around the 4 star mark, with only some of their offerings being truly noteworthy. Sadly, no matter how much they advertise, the wings here are at the most 3 stars. I LOVE CHICKEN WINGS (What a Sommelier is to fine wine, I am to chicken wings). Unfortunately, these wings are nothing special. A few of the flavors are admittedly delicious, but most are barely decent. The quality of the wings kill it; they are small, fatty, stringy, and covered in too much batter and gooey sauce. Also, the worst lemonade I've ever had at a restaurant.\nMost all of the food here is pretty darn good, and for a night at a bar or a bumping concert, the food psychologically turns exceptional. But in the sobering light of day, the food here is nothing special. Pay homage to what this place is, what it was, and what it stands for. It's a fun relic with good food and great music... still doesn't mean it's the best place out there to go out to eat."
1,Wonderful place to dine al fresco. Freshest food.
0,"Terrible service, plain and simple!"
1,"I have previously reviewed Eggspectation and found its kitchen creations excellent. They appear to have improved their service significantly since I last shared my opinions. As promised, therefore, four stars well-deserved. \n\nThe menu has been revamped and the quirkiness and puns are mostly gone, but the eggs surely aren't. I think I will miss the great variety of dishes one could select from, however they seem to focus on a core set of competences these days and churn out a very pleasant palette of flavors.\n\nWith the sad departure of a couple of my brunch haunts, my trekking over a kilometre to Eggspectation shows it's good, filling and pleasant."
0,"Let me say that this used to be one of my favorite sushi places in the valley.  I could care less that it wasn't all you could eat in the past because it was good quality and a pretty cool atmosphere.  Whenever I would go they would remember me and even my favorite rolls, the sushi chefs were super fun to talk to, and when eric was still there he would make up the most awesome presentations.  Gradually the quality of the sushi went down, and then eric disappeared, and the rolls coming out didn't even look or taste like their description or what I knew they were supposed to be.  They switched to all you can eat and several months ago (yes I took a while to write this) when we went it just was the last straw, the fish in those rolls was such bad quality I was a bit worried to eat it, almost every roll I ordered was made wrong, and the wait staff that used to be a really well oiled and cohesive unit was very disjointed.  It sucks they have gone so downhill when they used to be so awesome.  I wont be going back again."
1,"Went to 1 Oak last Saturday night and it was everything that I imagined a Vegas party being like. There is a 1 Oak in NYC (never been) and it has a great reputation as well. Me and my girls got in free, no line, no waiting, we sat at a promoters table with bottle service, (Skyy Vodka- ehhhh) danced on stage and then after went out onto the main dance floor and it was soooo much fun! We met a group of guys that had a table and partied with them for a little, the bottle service areas are pretty cool, cozy....I don't know why they serve Skyy of all vodkas? But whatever. The DJ was great, he was very versatile, my friends and I had a BLAST. It was packed but it was a damn good party! We met a bunch of promoters for 1 Oak on the strip and got put on the list and it was smooth sailing from there. I had a BLAST, it felt like New Years Eve again...will def go back."
0,Call me before I got here to make sure they had an LED bulb for my pool I came over but they did not match the price they did on the phone. I live in North Las Vegas and I found this a difficult place to find. Don't trust Google Maps.
0,"Went there just for a few drinks, the asu game happened to be on,  we don't keep up with football and had no idea. We understand you are crowded, our drinks took a little longer but hey, we only got one and our server was very attentive. However, as we were almost done with our beer, my friend asked me to take a seat really quick because I had an injured ankle and when we sat down literally for 2 mins (even tho we know someone would come and ask us to allow them to clean the table, we just needed a seat for a min) Abby came and rudely began to go on about her 6 page waiting list with attitude asking us to leave the table. Unnecessary to be rude, I have been in the industry for years, that's not the way you speak to a customer. Maybe you should train some off your staff a little better on etiquette."
0,"OMG sbarros! You guys suck in Las Vegas! The prices were high for no reason, there was no combos, and the flavor of the food was not good :( \nAnd I LOVE the sbarros here in SD, so believe me I know what Sbarros is supposed to taste like."
1,"The waitstaff was really informative and passionate about their Taiwanese food.  They patiently and enthusiastically explained their favorite dishes on the menu  and explained the story behind them.\n\nPortions are generous (well, maybe not the appetizers) and a good deal.  They cater to the nearby ASU students.\n\nI liked the garlic eggplant, which is surpising because I usually hate eggplant dishes.  The Beef Noodle soup was also tasty and I would conside just ordering this and this only next time I go.  And there will be  a nex time."
0,Worst service and the food comes out cold.
0,"Really now?! There mold in the meats have you guys checked that recently?  Rice is old and soggy. Plates are barely cleaned. Not what I expected when it comes to \""fine\"" dining."
0,"The employees seem friendly enough however they are not efficient in this profession. Also I was told by a teller to wait in the lobby for a banker to assist me when all I needed was to report my card lost and order/ obtain a replacement. Either the lack of training or staff, perhaps both is hindering this branch to reach its potential. I have worked for banks for the past 6 years and have not received or given this level of service before. I am appalled to call these \""financial professionals\"" colleagues. When I was finally seen by the Banker, I informed him of my discontent & he barely acknowledged it. He basically went on the offensive starting that I Needed to understand that they are all busy. I ended up closing my account due to this experience and his attitude.\n\nI also visited the Citibank branch just up the street(total different experience) & in less than 5 minutes I made a deposit and had my card ordered for expedited delivery in two business days. Now that's service.\n\nIn both cases I was the first in line and had completely different outcomes. Suck it Wells!!"
1,"If you have a sweet tooth but don't feel like eating a 600+ calorie ice cream dessert,  you've got to check out Frost!  It's delicious, creamy,  and satisfies a sweet tooth for a minimal amount of calories.  My fave is the Italian Cookies & Cream one!  :)"
1,"Good club, great music, long lines, a friend hooked it up so we didn't have to wait.  Ladies, if you don't have a table ,wear comfortable shoes, men get the table so your ladies can sit.  I swear I think my feet would have been more blistered and bloody if I couldn't sit."
1,"This is a cool park to checkout. If you're walking, don't bother with Notre Dame, the second island. If you want to sight see, you can probably run through what's worth seeing in a hour. However, on a nice day, you can certainly spend time laying, wadding in the stream, or strolling through the trees. We also saw what looked like a nice pool. Not sure about admission, since we were not looking to go in."
1,Had the fresh mixed berry smoothie and enjoyed the quickly whipped and rich drink. Wonderful! This place next to first floor elevator.
1,"I'm not exactly how I started going to Sweet Daddy Cupcakes, but I haven't looked back since first stepping foot into their shop. Their cupcakes are absolutely phenomenal! To me, it's all about the frosting -- and I could literally eat a tub of their frosting... it's not the thick, butter-based frosting that makes you feel like you're churning butter in your mouth; it's creamy and finger-licking good. Then the cupcakes themselves are so moist, and flavorful. The cupcake flavors are well thought out and they always rotate different flavors so you are able to try something new when you stop in. Hands down, Sweet Daddy's definitely has the best cupcakes in town, from their cupcake flavors, to the frosting and glitter on top. I literally drive 30-45 minutes to get a Sweet Daddy cupcake (or a dozen) anytime I need a sugar fix. So worth it!"
1,Bought this on a groupon and boy am I hooked!  This place has good food and a great variety.  I would recommend you get the larger portion as its very cost effective.  Samurai Sam's...I will return!
1,"My favorite breakfast place in west island! Its not the cheapest place and it has nothing to do with healthy eating, you go there to enjoy yourself and literally pig out. \n\nLove their potatoes and the crepe filled with a banana and Nutella!"
1,"My fiancee and I had dinner at this Brio Saturday night and enjoyed great service, great food,  and delicious drinks.  The bartender was outstanding!"
1,"Beer-wise, I still prefer Papago Brewing and Topps. But the ambiance was pretty delightful, the service was great (it helps to have a cute kid), and the pizza was shockingly good.\n\nThat's not hyperbole. I mean, we're not talking Pizzeria Bianco here - deep dish is the focus - but we were stunned at the depth, complexity and deliciousness of the California Carver. It's not often you come across innovation in the world of pizza, but this was really phenomenal."
1,"New First Meal/Breakfast Review:\n\nA couple of months ago the AZ Republic had coupon inserts for Taco Bell's roll-out of their new breakfast menu. They call it The First Meal. Not being a breakfast person, I ignored it. \n\nWell, several months later, more and more TBs are starting to serve breakfast.  Soon almost all their Phoenix locations will have it. What can you expect?  Typical Taco Bell faire with some interesting twists. \n\nTheir big new item, is something call the \""AM Crunchwap\"".  Your choices are either bacon or sausage. I tried the bacon and it's quite good.  It's a little smaller than their normal Crunchwrap, maybe 3/4 of inch.  It's filled with scrambled egg, bacon, cheese and a creamy Jalapeno sauce that gives off a little heat.  Yummy!\n\nThe key to the sandwich, besides the flavorful sauce, is a very thin circular hash-brown that is in the middle of the wrap.  I liked it and it's priced at only $2.49 each. BTW, breakfast is served until 11 am.\n\nShould Mickey Ds next door start worrying? No. But along with their Bacon or Sausage Skillet (Soft Taco) for $0.99, it's a nice alternative.  The Combo meal ran me slightly less than $4.00, excluding tax.  \n\nSurprisingly, there doesn't seem to be any decent coffee option.  When I paid, the server offered me a medium drink. Taco Bell's First Meal won't change my habit of skipping breakfast, but I might give them a try every couple of months.\n\nWow, I just gave a Taco Bell Four Stars.  D'oh!"
0,Customer appreciation  tonight. Head out to enjoy the night . Time to go home. Complementary  shuttle called... Half way home (B&F ) shuttle tells me it's $10 to get home ... Driver makes us get out at white and Parker and Honeycutt . I have no problem paying $20! The problem with (B&F) shuttle is they try to take advantage of you because you have been drinking . Why not make it  clear before you pick it up? Oshays please don't use B&F shuttle anymore
1,"I won't beat around the bush here, NiuKee is a hole in the wall. Down a darkened side street with an abandoned lot on one side and something forgettable on the other side, the customer entrance looks more like a service entrance.  Proceed up the decrepit looking stairs and on the second floor amongst the yellowing Chinese kitsch used as decor is the dining area.  Crowded with assorted tables and chairs that saw better days a decade ago take a seat and grab a menu. Be sure to glance at the aging dumbwaiter which just seems so out of place to me, but undeniably useful.\n\nIf you've made it this far(into my review and the restaurant), it's fair to conclude the NiuKee isn't about the decor.  You're here for the food and NiuKee serves up some of the most authentic Mainland Chinese food you'll be able to find in Montreal.  The first thing to note is that they do serve cold beer, which is always welcome. I'd recommend eating with friends on a Friday or Saturday night before heading to a more serious watering hole.\n\nThe food is exactly as you would find if you were in a similar establishment in China.  The spicy chicken is actually spicy and has bones, they serve classics like julienned potatoes with peppers, spicy green beans with pork, and the always popular cucumbers and garlic appetizer.  Having soup with dinner is the norm in China and here at NiuKee we usually choose the fish with pickled vegetables since the broth makes a delicious soup.\n\nNot fine dining, but good food at decent prices and very authentically Chinese.  It's probably worth bringing a Chinese friend with you if you aren't familiar with real Chinese food. Though, if you are feeling adventurous, go without and play food roulette, because remember they have beer and everything is better with beer."
1,"They are very, very creative in the themes of the show... and parts of the show they are very interactive with their audience... \n\nI give them props to be dancing that active for an hour long on and off...\n\nBut, it's a show that once you've seen it.... you won't watch it again ... for awhile..."
1,"A sushi AYCE treasure 5 miles off the strip. Decent quality fish, good service, reasonable price, and a great selection compared to other sushi AYCE places.\n\nLiving in the OC area for 4 years, there are tons of AYCE sushi places and I have visited many of them. Hikari compares and ranks among the best places found in the OC.\n\nFirst off, most places don't offer unlimited fresh oysters, uni, and fried soft shell crabs. Most places are very stingy with these items, but the sushi chef allowed us to order the oysters by the dozens, mounded the uni on the sushi, and gave us 4 freshly fried crabs. The oysters were seasoned with ponzu and Japanese sweet mayo. The uni was sweet and creamy (bad uni tastes and smells like dead fish ass). The soft shell crabs were very succulent, each bite contained chunks of salty meat and creamy guts. Nom.\n\nTheir fish selections were pretty good. They even offer amaebi (sweet shrimp) raw which is always good. Most places charge $7.50 a plate for it and this place hands them out like candy! The ono (white fish) is also worth mentioning, it had a very creamy and savory white flesh (be sure to get it seared with a blow torch, it releases the fats and allows for a more melting bite, without it the ono will be very tough and chewy). Careful with the ono too, it's a oily fish so don't ingest TOO much of it (oily in oily out if you catch my drift).\n\nAnyways, I always make a effort to come here everytime i'm in Vegas. I just came back from the Holiday season and my advice is NEVER to go here during big holidays. The place gets packed and they run out of most of the popular stuff like the oysters and uni."
1,"Went to this place with my friend for some fresh oysters. Didn't realize the bread they serve is so amazing!!! The oysters were fantastic and after two, yes thats TWO, loafs of their awesome bread I was stuffed. Great place to visit, a little pricy but worth it for sure."
0,"Honestly, I probably just ordered the wrong item.  I think this place could have the potential to be a 3 star or even 4 star fast-food restaurant, but my experience on this trip was pretty poor.\n\nI had a philly cheesesteak.  It was pretty tiny considering it cost $6.89 pre tax.  The bread was more of a flatbread instead of a hoagie bread; it was weird.  It was a bit heavy on the green peppers.  The cheese (provolone) to steak ratio was good though.  The meat was gross though.  It was bland and had a mushy texture.  I'm thinking that the meat was boiled instead of grilled.\n\nMy friends seemed to enjoy their burgers, but they also seemed a bit small for the over $6 price point (without fries).\n\nThe onion rings were good but once again I'm not sure if they were worth the $3.39 price.  They are huge and are an actual onion ring (not the composite mushy stuff).  I guess the rings just weren't good enough to overcome my disapointment with the cheesesteak."

0,"Myself and my husband initiated contact with Martinez and Shanken after being referred to their office by someone we do business with. Our appointment was with Lynn Frost a self reported \""accountant\"". Our appointment was for personal and business accounting purposes. We set up an appointment for Lynn to prepare and file our personal and business 2011 taxes as well as to perform bookkeeping services for 2011. We were guaranteed that our taxes would be filed on time and correctly. Unfortunately neither were true. All of our filings were extended, done incorrectly and/or not filed at all. We have since found out that our \""accountant\"" is in fact not an accountant but a business development manager who prepared and filed all of our taxes and oversaw all of our bookkeeping. When we called the office to ask questions regarding their services we were told that Lynn is in charge of our account and were sent to her extension and when I specifically asked for the bookkeeper for our account, the only information she or he could give me is what Lynn had told them. We have had large penalties, fees and additional taxes incurred because of their fraudulent and inadequate services and are still being billed by their office for services that were not performed correctly, not performed at all and/or at a fee that was not agreed upon. In response to a letter we sent to them we were told that any services that were incorrect or needed to be amended would be done by them at no cost, however the last 4 appointments made with their office were cancelled on the day they were set for. We were told that an appointment with the CPA would incur a fee and we had no one else to go to. We had deadlines for our 2012 taxes and needed to have the information completed quickly which required that I go to another accountant before we had more penalties, fees and additional taxes. This new accountant also amended many mistakes their office had made on the 2011 taxes. We have run out of resources to remedy this situation."
0,"I wish there was a zero star option. I've used the cab services in Pittsburgh several times and I can say that every driver I've had was cold and had no personality. \n\nMy last encounter (if you can even call it that) was the worst. We were downtown for Pittsburgh Pride and needed a ride back to the Slopes. It was 2 a.m. and busses weren't running so they were our only option. The three of us all waited on hold for about 30 minutes with their hotline till we realized we weren't getting anywhere. We decided to just walk back rather than wait for someone to answer to probably just tell us the wait would be three hours (and that's if they show up!).\n\nThis is why Lyft and Uber are taking over and EXACTLY why I will only use these ride-sharing apps from now on. Not only are the cars cleaner, but the drivers are much more personable. Not to mention that they always show up and are at your front door in a matter of minutes."
1,"Great view, I did not try the roller coaster I may be crazy but not stupid. We did not stay here just checking out the view, so for that it got 4 stars"
0,Service was ok. My wife and I had the dim sum quite disappointing!  The Gyoza did not taste fresh.  Prices were average. Would not recommend!
1,"We stumbled upon Las Palmas when we were looking for something open on New Year's day.  What a pleasant surprise!  The lady who greeted us was so sweet!  She was very warm and welcoming, and she had such a lovely smile.\n\nAs for the food, the menu is a mixture of Cuban, Columbian, and Ecuadorian cuisine.  It's heavily protein based so there's not much for vegetarians except for a few side dishes.  I ended up asking for a plate of yellow rice, black beans, green plantains, and guacamole.  I also asked for their hottest salsas.  Though my entree was a culmination of small dishes, the food was delicious.  I particularly loved the guacamole with it's lemony zest which had a wonderful kick to it.  The salsas tasted very fresh and blended perfectly with everything.  My friend had a cuban sandwich and french fries and I tried a bite of her fries and loved it.  The french fry was slightly crispy, full, and soft on the inside, and had just the right amount of salt to it.\n\nThe decor is simple and quaint.  The interior presents itself a lot better than it does on the outside, where it's located in strip mall in an area that's pretty drab.  If you can get past that, then the food and service will not disappoint.  Price wise too, very pocket friendly."
0,"Visited today. Spent $15 on an IMAX ticket and $15 on concessions. Everyone I interacted with was unfriendly and the 6 kids working at the concession were having a gruesome conversation about the most humane way to kill an animal while ringing up my order. The icing on the cake was being denied access to the theater because I had a coffee from Starbucks, even after purchasing theater concessions. No one mentioned this when I bought my ticket or purchase concessions nor was a sign posted at the entrance. I was told to \""chug it or toss it\"". With these prices and this treatment I will not be back."
1,"Not exactly what I expected ..................I liked it. \n\nI was thinking some sprawling ranch house with wood floors and saw dust everywhere, maybe some old west artifacts on the walls and grumpy old waitresses. \n\nWhat I got was a cool little funky building, with cool interior and neat things on the walls. More of a sports bar atmosphere with a good sized dining area. Killer staff and great food. \n\nI had a burger, I believe flat grilled, cooked medium rare and I could tell it was good beef. They said they grind it themselves. The fries were great as they are a fresh cut type. The beans were different. They were a lighter vinegary type of bean with onion and bacon. I liked them but could not eat the whole pot that came out. \n\nIt ended up being a little expensive. 9 for the burger and Fries, 2.50 for the drink and 1.50 for the beans. Tax and tip it was an 18 dollar lunch."
0,"60% of the dancers are great looking but th eproblem is they discriminate and the dancers seem to choose the guys they want to dance to. I saw neary 7 girls but the really hot ones never came to me. They would look at me and then pass on to the next table. They even spent time sitting idle or sitting in some one else's table rather than asking me.So i request the management to speak to these girls and ask them not to discriminate. Since everyone pays the cover charge, the girls need to be told to ask each and everyone else management should refund the cobver charge."
1,Love this place because this is the closet to what I enjoy back home in Hawaii. It doesn't taste as fresh as Hawaii but it still good to me.
1,"Vraiment une boutique charmante, toujours enchant\u00e9e de trouv\u00e9 ce que j'ai besoin en version \u00e9quitable et plusieures belle chose \u00e0 offrir."
1,I love this place. Used to love in chandler and came quite often. Really good food every time. Haven't been in a while but I absolutely love it. Good sushi and Korean food (;
1,Love the food and service.  The only problem with brownies is their hours. Soups are always super yummy!
1,"Went there on a saturday night. The place was full and hopping! Using other reviews, my wife and I tried the grilled octopus on a bed of greens- delicious and recommended, we tried the lobster ravioli- delicious and recommended and finally we shared a veal chop grilled to perfection."
1,Stumbled in here because it was pretty crowded.  Good call.  Quite possibly some of the best pho I've had in recent memory.
1,"Here's the skimp on the Capital Grille for the average joe..\n\nThe ambiance is great, service spectacular, prices intimidatingly expensive, mixed with good quality food but just OK flavors.\n\nI had the Kona crusted dry aged steak w/ shallot butter. I couldn't taste too much of the coffee flavor but the steak was fairly tender and the portion was huge. The shallot butter was great but I didn't have nearly enough to give the extra amount of flavor it needed. Call me crazy but this steak was not nearly good enough to stand on its own without the saltiness I'm used to. I even had to ask for au jus and even that was pretty bland. For a $47 steak a la carte I expected more flavor, A LOT more.\n\nOn the other hand, the parmesan truffle fries were amazing (as they are at every other place I've had them). The waiter even gave our table of 5 free shots as well as a complimentary dessert trio because it was my friend's birthday. The coconut cream pie that was part of that dessert was so light and fluffy, definitely the star of the night.\n\nWhat can I say Capital Grille? You have 5 star ambiance/service but 3 star food."
1,"This is the only place I go to buy my boards and gear. I tried going to Big5, but the quality is average at best. Sports Chalet is ok, but their prices are too steep and don't have the professional help and knowledge that is needed for you to find the right board and gear. Then there is Powder and Sun, my go to place for all my snowboarding needs. The staff is super helpful, friendly and extremely knowledgable because everyone that works there are boarders and have a passion for it. Prices are very reasonable and post and pre season sales are the best! When you're ready to finally buy your own board or just pick up some new gear to feed your addiction, there isn't any better place to go than Powder and Sun."
1,Raising Cane's is definitely a nice place to eat at. Good atmosphere and the chicken is nice and crispy. The texas toast is also very good. Eat here and thank me later!
0,"I ordered the chorizo breakfast meal. Food is good but service sucks here. The waitress didn't ask if anyone needed refill of coffee or water and when we have to ask for it, it takes awhile for it to come. I'm giving it two stars because the food is good but the service is poor that I won't come back. I can't enjoy good food with bad/poor service. Price is reasonable and portions is huge. The waiting wasn't long. It took less than ten minutes to sit nine of us."
0,"This was the second sushi visit in one day for me, so I was really in the mood. I had heard good things about Mikado, but had never been.\n\nWe ordered tuna, yellowtail, and salmon nigiri, a angry cucumber salad (which was described as \""spicy\""), a kimchi roll, and eel nigiri.\n\nThe tuna was mealy in texture, the yellowtail was fine, and the salmon was okay. The cucumber salad was okay, but not as described. The kimchi rolls didn't really taste anything like kimchi, just cabbage-y, and the eel rolls were good, but needed more sauce.\n\nAnd it took the staff a bit of time to greet us when we walked in.\n\nNothing was bad with the exception of the tuna, but nothing was really outstanding either. I won't be back."
0,"Scored a pretty sweet deal and got a \""premium\"" for $50. Granted, it was a random Tuesday evening when I stayed at the Palms, but still, king size bed, decent views, wi-fi included...now that's a pretty good deal.\n\nIt was maintained well, keeping with the modern decor. It's not like the Tropicana with the old 70's style carpet with actual 70's carpet.\n\nI wasn't impressed with the casino. From behind the scenes, it looks like the busy workers were keeping the slot machines all nice and maintained by cording off sections while they were working on it.\n\nBut in reality, it was just a way for them to manipulate the machines to their favor. How do I know this? I was playing some slot machines nearby and overheard one of the floor managers telling the maintenance folks who was working on some of the machines, \""Hey, I noticed a lot of winners on those machines.\"" And the maintenance guy replies back, \""Yah, we're here to fix that!!\""\n\nAlthough I enjoyed my room with all the amenities, I probably wouldn't come back to play in their casino."
1,"This place is awesome.  \n\nI won't go into detail, cuz there's plenty of reviews about how good the food is.  The only reason I give it 4 stars, instead of 5 is the price is a bit steep for pizza, and getting a seat requires some patience.  But then again, it's not Pizza Hut.  Place is very busy plan on a 45 minute to hour wait on weekends....but worth it.  \n\nI usually now go in for lunch where you get a giant slice for 3.99...either way, the food is great, albeit a tad pricy...."
0,"Woke up on a Friday morning and urgently needed a pho fix.\n\nThe special combo beef pho was a no-go.\nThe soup was really oily along with a herbal taste.\n However, they have fresh coconut juice and perfect Vietnamese coffee !!\n\nUm, won't be back."
0,"45 minutes between clearing appetizers & being served dinner. Extremely disappointed in meal & service. Went here a few times years ago months after it's opening when both food & service were phenomenal. Seems like different place, so we'll be going elsewhere in the future."
1,"Excellent beer selection, fantastic food, and a really nice atmosphere make for a win.  When the weather is nice, the long wait is tempered by drinks out front.  My only complaint is that the hostess was difficult to locate and was extremely rude, but hey, at least we got a table."
0,"I mistakenly reviewed the Aruba, but then realized I meant the lounge IN the Aruba... anyway! I hope the Hotel and Spa are better than the lounge.\n\nI will never go here again.  I have been two or three times, and the bartender(s?) SUCK.  The drinks are way overpriced for a dive bar, and just, no.\n\nStory: I order a bloody mary with Absolut.  Bartender tells me they don't have Absolut.  Ok, fine, Stoli, whatevs.  \""We don't have bloody mary mix.\"" Uh? wtf? Why are we arguing over vodka then?\n\nMy friend orders a Rusty Nail (scotch + Drambuie).  Ok, nobody but 70 year olds even know what that is, so he explains it, no prob there.  But the bartender isn't even sure what SCOTCH is.... He points out the Dewar's and Drambuie and she takes them off the shelf.  We pay for our drinks, and then wonder why his is RED.  Because she made him a Dewar's and CRANBERRY.  EW.  So he explains that it's supposed to be DRAMBUIE (which, really, does not even sound like cranberry).... so she remakes the drink and he gets... wait for it.... Drambuie and Cranberry.  Yeah. I think I'll just walk a block to Dino's next time."
0,"Chicken was very dry and I had a hard time cutting the chicken even with a steak knife. Chips were nice and warm, salsa was just okay. Service was good I will give it 2 stars."
0,"Please make 0 stars an option Yelp!  Avoid BOB and STEVE at the Thomas/44th St. location at all costs! Got suckered into a Serta Perfect Sleeper here, and within a MONTH the nearly $1500.00 bed was sagging!  We didn't want to deal with it and are moving and called Bedmart about the warranty weeks ago.  They looked up our file, and said that an inspector would \""be in touch\"" to set up an appointment to inspect the bed.  I waited a week and called back but they said not to worry.  I called a week later, and they said they would \""look into it.\""  Called again and they said they'd look into it again, but go no return call.  Finally, I called again today, for the 4th time, and STEVE told me there was no way it would happen until next year (after we move).  \n\nThat's annoying, and bad service, sure, but the reason I'm writing this is that they were patronizing, rude, and just plain insulting.  When I said I was dissatisfied at having to wait a month, after we move, just for the initial appointment, STEVE spoke to me like he was doing me a favor to look into why we had not been contacted!  In fact, he actually said this!  He was vague about the whole thing and when I asked a question about it, he actually said he could fax my request to the \""factory today\"" or \""THROW IT IN THE TRASH!\""  \n\nBTW, the \""manager\"" Bob said the factory is actually closed, so faxing it was not a favor at all!  Either way, are they really doing me a favor to follow up on the bad service for the crappy product they sell?  No!  \n\nI called back and asked to speak to the store manager, who answered the phone and identified himself as BOB.  Without even giving me a chance to say hello, he gruffly said he had heard the whole conversation and was not going to allow abuse.  I explained that I was the abused one, and that unless I had been on speaker phone, he had only heard one side of the conversation.  He did not like facts, and was even more rude after I pointed this out.  Needless to say, he clearly did not care about customer service, talked over me and cut me off, and spoke to me like he was Donald Trump and I was his peon contestant.  He proceeded to tell me that there would be no inspection anytime soon, since the Serta factory was closed until the New Year. \n\nBut he offered a hollow favor...if I wanted, he would call me Monday, Xmas Eve.  Umm, hello, but you just told me the factory who sets up the inspection appointments, is closed for 10 days...so what new information would you have in 2 days?  BOB did not want to be bothered with facts, and just wanted to shove it to me, whether it made sense or not, so he kept repeating and belaboring this.  \n\n\""When does the factory open, I asked?\""  But BOB, who either made up the whole thing about the closure, or knew only half the facts, or just wanted to keep shoving it to me, wouldn't tell me.  \""When do you want me to call you back, since you want everything on your schedule,\"" he asked.  \""How about right when the factory re-opens.\""  \""How about we just have them call you to set up the appointment,\"" he said.  Um, but \""I already did that weeks ago, and they didn't set it up,\"" I pointed out.  (That's why I called 4 times.)  \""Whenever the factory opens, the next day would be fine,\"" I said.  Then BOB decided, even though I told him this would not work, he would not follow up on why they hadn't called and just start over.  In other words, throw the follow-up request in the trash!  No, I said, I don't want that.  \""That's what I'm doing,\"" and then hung up on me\n\nWe went to BedMart looking for a latex mattress that was firm.  But Bed Mart on 44th/Thomas convinced us that this spring bed would be great and would not sag.  They lied.  Then we call about the warranty because the bed is crap and they know it, we don't hear from them repeatedly.  Someone else at the 44th/Thomas location was supposed to follow up with me two days ago but never did (on my 3rd call).  Clearly, they want to get a bed sold, period.  If you have a problem, which eventually you will, they will tell you it is someone else fault, not return calls, patronizingly tell you that they are doing you a favor to follow up on your lack of service, and basically treat you like you are crap because you have a problem with the bed.  To top it all off, they will hang up on you and be rude.  Stay away from this location, from BedMart generally, and from Bob and Steve!"
0,"DLUX is a restaurant that is still struggling to figure out what it would like to be.  I have been twice and both times left me wanting. \n\nPros:\n\n- The interior is beautiful.  I LOVE looking at the bar.\n- The sweet potato fries are nothing to write home about alone, but are delicious with the siracha mayo.  \n- The service is friendly, but green. \n- Seating was immediate.\n- Plenty of ramp parking not too far away\n\nCons:\n\n- The food was unremarkable.  It wasn't bad by any means, but easily forgotten.  I really appreciate that DLUX took a chance with the vegetarian white bean burger, but it was lost in the bun.   \n\n-  The music was far too loud at night.  It was at a level that would have been fine if it was full of bar patrons, but the restaurant was almost empty.   It resulted in a lot of shouting to waiters and dining companions.\n\n- The toasted marshmallow milkshake was a total loss.  The milkshake had the consistency of water.  And, the marshmallow is not toasted - it is burnt.  It took a couple of hours to clear the ash taste out of the mouth.  The pecan milkshake was rich, but watery and unremarkable.\n\n- I know this is a bit nit picky, but the lighting did not transition to dinner at the right time.  It felt like we were eating in a cafeteria until the lighting changed.  Then, the atmosphere was much better.\n\nOverall:\n\nIt is an easily forgettable, unoffensive place for a quick first date with an internet connection.  There are just too many other great places nearby to go back to DLUX again."
0,"As you would expect from a place as ornate as Caesar's Palace, this has to be the prettiest Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. Its gleaming bright white is festooned with paisley-like cut-outs to give oh-so-subtle silhouette patterns from floor to ceiling (see photos). If you ask me, it's a little too white, sort of like a scene from George Lucas' \""THX 1138\"" (sorry for the geek sci-fi reference). The only real color comes courtesy of the thousands of goldfish inhabiting the oblong tanks along the entryway. It's quite a sight since you're never quite sure if they are there for decoration or as a potential appetizer. \n\nYet, even when you're seated, the white-on-white decor makes you feel like everyone is staring and your fly is open. Jamie W. and I quickly buried our heads into the menus. We decided to share two dishes, both extravagantly priced - the $20.09 Steamed Scallops and Vermicelli with Garlic and the $16.09 Braised Pork with Rice Noodle Beijing Style (see photos). Note the artificial use of the number 9 in their prices to reflect their name. Anyway, when the dishes came out, we were both startled at how decidedly mediocre they looked and tasted. It was like watching a supermodel wearing a stunning outfit only to discover she was wearing dirty panties underneath. \n\nThe scallops were not terrible, just paltry (only six served) and bland with an incompatible pile of transparent pasta underneath. The braised beef dish, however, was deplorable. Whether the noodles were homemade or not, they looked like the kind of thick chow mein you would get at a bad suburban take-out joint. Again, the meat portion was paltry, and there was nothing to indicate it had been braised more than sitting in a wok for far too long. Not only the food was disappointing, but the service was surly and the hostess had attitude. Perhaps there were too many high-rollers who didn't leave tips. \n\nFOOD - 2 stars...mediocre and pricey, a deadly combination \nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...like I said, pretty white-on-white decor with lots of goldfish \nSERVICE - 2 stars...why the sour face? \nTOTAL - 2 stars...take a pass and go to Noodles in the Bellagio...better food with a smile"
0,"Ok I don't know where to begin... I guess the beginning. I was brought here with great intentions for a great night with someone who knows German food. That's the best part of the experience! \nThe place was empty and the server was nice and attentive but not anything special. I had asked for a specific salad dressing and he had told me they don't have it when they did. I had also said no onions and they were still on there. \nThe iced tea was watered down or something as tasted very bland. There were only pork protein options except one dish. I don't typically eat pork except ribs so I got the one meat dish. The sauerbraten was very fatty meat but the part I did have was good in a nice sauce. The bread we got was skimpy, no rolls like in the picture and it was stale rye bread. His jaeger schnitzel was good as I had a few bites but I liked my sauce better. The spaetzle was also bland but looked like it should have so much more flavor. his beer also came in a liquor glass... Seemed odd but maybe a cultural thing and didnt seem to be the amount of beer stated on menu. The 6-10 bites of food I had was decent hence the two stars. Also if I ate more pork it might have been different... The only other German restaurant I went to at least had chicken options or something. The only chicken had ham with it and the waiter said couldn't make without it as already done. \nNow I have a sweet tooth... Apple pie is one of my favorites... However the picture of the strudel didn't seem appetizing as 80% pastry and 20% apple. Oh well saved me the calories. Maybe German isn't my thing, maybe just an off day and I should keep an open mind and give one more try, but with all the restaurants out there I like and that I haven't tried yet, it will not be a rush back."
0,"So, as we walk into Orchids Gardens, my friend tells me that this particular location has been shut down several times by the health department, and then has re-branded itself several times.  My response?  Well they must have their act together now.\n\nWe were sat promptly in the vast room at a large round table.  A server came by immediately and offered us drinks and then we were bombarded by a line of waitresses sling all kinds of food items of a plastic encased rolling gueridon.  A lot of times, we couldn't understand what they were selling, but we tried it anyway, cause we were feeling adventurous.  \n\nOne overwhelming factor in my poor experience was the temperature of the food.  Out of the ten items we received, one was hot, three were luke warm, and six were cold.  The flavors and textures were decent, but it was pretty hard to get past the temperature issue.   \n\nMaybe i'll com back and try ordering off the menu, but for now, thumbs down."
0,"I had read a review that King's was an over priced Red Lobster. Unfortunately the food didn't even measure up to that. Over cooked fishy tasting salmon that wasn't fresh, soft shell crab was horrible, and for the price point we were expecting much more."
0,"I'll start by saying... The concept is great. \nExecution is a completely different story. \nWe were excited about the menu and ordered quite an array of items. We ordered a burger and truffle fries, Greek pizza, ahi sirachi taco, hot-mame, and strawberry lemonade. \nLet's start by saying I understand that this is a new place... Get it. I understand that they didn't anticipate such traffic... Get it. \nSo.... The key is to make your guest who will be visibly irritated at the chaos & lack of uniformity feel important and happy. That's not happening. The employees are just as confused as the people arriving!!!\nWe walked in never having been here. WE see that it's crowded... Assume we have to wait, which is fine. The guy at the front wants to tell me about the menu.... I'm not dense or stupid.... Ill figure the menu out. What I would like you to do is answer how I'm to proceed with my 2 year old son and 1 year old nephew and two other members of my party. He tells me there is no list to put our names down on and it's first come first serve. The problem with that idea is that there was already a line out the door and people standing around waiting for tables...... Let's put it this way, it's just a shit fest. The Blind leading the blind. \nYeah you can take it to go..... BUT GO WHERE?!?? The place is on a desolate road near the strip. \nThey get a two because the food was good. \nThe other three stars they can get if I ever decide to come back to this place after they work the kinks out and get their shit together.....oh & after I visit every other restaurant that we'd like to in Vegas..... You know... Where they have seats and a staff. Not just food and a register. \n\nThe highlight was the strawberry lemonade... Which for the other two people with me was horrible, for me was great bc it wasn't sweet and literally tasted like strawberry, lemon, and water. \n\n**side note: while there they asked a couple to move to the bar bc they were taking up seats at a table for a bigger party...... And people were at the ALREADY busy register asking for boxes and trying to correct wrong orders. ...... A MESS!"
1,"Omg!! I can't believe how amazing the people are here, quick to get me my caffeine fix, and so, so nice. I was killed by kindness and I liked it. Still smiling as I'm driving down the road, iced double torture in hand. Thanks for making my morning extra awesome."
0,"The quality of food has gone down. Food comes out warm, dry ribs and quality just isn't the same. I used to like it here."
0,"I SOOOOOO wanted to like this place! It's so close to where I work that I could stop on the way for coffee. I've been frequenting Sambalatte, which I absolutely LOVE and keep meaning to check out Tipsy's. So today, I finally did.\nIt is definitely a cute place with a comfortable feel. I like that they offer regular milk, plus almond or rice milk to make their espresso drinks. \nI ordered a 12 oz plain hot latte with whole milk, which was almost $4 (pretty standard). My first disappointment was that it came in a paper to go cup. I was pretty surprised they didn't offer real coffee mugs if you are not taking your drink to go. So I sat to work on some paperwork and upon trying my latte, I have to admit I was a little disappointed. It wasn't TERRIBLE or anything. It was \""OK\"" - my impression was that  I would drink one again, but I MUCH prefer a latte from Sambalatte.\nBefore I left, I wanted to get some truffles for family back home as a part of their Christmas gift. I had read good reviews of them so I thought, \""why not??!!\""\nI ordered 4 truffle cake balls and 4 truffle drops, plus a couple small bags of choc covered espresso beans (only 0.99 each, a great deal!!) The barista bagged them up for me and rang me up. It came to just over $20. Yes, expensive, but I knew it would be so it was no surprise. Plus, they were gifts and I didn't mind. He put them in a nice, black bag that had their brand name on the outside. Since the truffles were going to 2 separate people, I asked if he had another bag. He said they didn't have a bag like that that was smaller, and that particular bag is \""really expensive\"". He then offered a plain white lunch sack or a brown paper bag with handles. Well, I have those at home so I declined. I was pretty turned off that I, in less than one hour, could spend $20 on truffles and $4 on coffee in a place and they wouldn't give me an extra bag......To me, that just comes down to customer service and giving your customer what they want. Unfortunately, it will make the difference of me returning to the store or not. I believe in good customer service and my first impression ruined the prospect of me returning. \nI hate to give anyone a low rating of 2 stars, but that really sums up my experience. And like I said, I really wanted to like them!"
0,"A group of friends and I went into this bar on a Friday night.  I've had friends who had okay experiences, and I personally have been in there once before and it wasn't terrible, so it had potential, I guess.  I got my first drink from the bar and chatted with my friends, went to the restroom, got a new drink and went to the patio, where I was immediately accosted by two large bouncers (I'm a pretty small girl) who told me I was stumbling, belligerent, slurring, and disruptive, and I had to leave.  Despite all my efforts to have a rational conversation with them about what I could have possibly done wrong (since I'd been on the patio for about six seconds before they asked me to leave), they were rude and, frankly, pretty mean.  \n\nThis bar is not busy enough to be throwing out all of their bar patrons, to be honest.  We went over to Cactus Moon, who not only treated us much better but also said this happens at Toby's pretty often.  Drink at your own risk, I suppose.  The risk being that you might buy an overpriced drink and be forced to leave most of it behind.. that's one (super shady) way to make money in a struggling bar!  :)"
1,"Love this place. I've been three times, once for pizza, then penne in vodka sauce, and most recently spaghetti with meat sauce. Absolutely everything is made fresh and I can taste every bit of it! The sauces are fantastic. Next time I'm trying the pesto. I don't even like pesto, but that's how much I enjoy the food here. The service is great too. Very friendly and warm staff. Feels like home."
0,"I was going to give this place 3 stars but when I sat down to write my review, \""Meh\"" was the first that came to mind, so it gets 2 stars since that is the literal description Yelp give a 2 star rating.  Anyway... I came here 3 time during a trip to Vegas.  Once just for shakes and candy with the kids.  The shakes were prety good but definitely not worth $10 each.  Then we came for brunch with a groupon.  Again, nothing special.  Food was mediocre and priced too high.  Service was ok, not teriffic. It's a crowded place so that could affect attentiveness of the staff. We were underwhelmed but I forgot to use the groupon so we had to go back again before heading home.  Once again, nothing was special, nothing was delicious, nothing was terrible.  Still, $10 for a shake, $30 for a coctail (albeit huge) and $25 for chicken and waffles (obviously not homemade) isn't worth it.  There are many more quality places to eat in Vegas at those prices."
0,"We ordered naans, chicken curry and chicken biryani to pick up in Indian Masala when we were in Vegas on vacation.\nWe didn't know that Indian Masala has 2 branches one on strip and one here.  we went to the one on strip and then came here, coz they said they're different.  what a waste of time!! anyways, it's our mistake to get confused.\n\nComing to the food.  What a horrible food.  Sooo disappointing. The naans are burnt to the core.  I somehow managed to get one small piece that wasn't burnt and it is uncooked!!! How can somebody manage to burn so much yet uncook???\nChicken was soooooo raw and had bones.  A good vet could still have saved the hen!!"
0,The owner is extremely rude and yelled at my wife and kids as they were leaving Goldie's next door saying they were being too loud.  I've seen him him complain several other times about kids being in that shopping center.  I will never eat at Voila because of the owner's poor behavior and the way he treated my wife and kids.
0,"So....I read the reviews on Yelp & Urban Spoon.\nMostly negative, but hey I was hungry and gave it a shot.\nIt's true the place is dingy & like entering a Greek grandfather's home. \nI was first asked  if I wanted huumus. I declined that after reading is was mediocre at best. So I tried the $5.25 saganaki. It came out in an old brown dish with what looked like rubber floating in lemon juice and oil. * The owner failed to mention the pita bread was extra.\nIt tasted WORSE than it looked (if that was possible). Tough cheese mostly tasteless and chewy. * I have had many saganaki in various countries. This ranked as one of the VERY worst! I made the best decision to leave before food poisoning set in. Bottom line:  HORRIFIC !!!"
0,$26 for a midori sour.  Are you kidding me?  Also too crowded for my tastes.
1,"The wings are the best I've ever had.  What stops me from giving it five starts is that they do not give celery sticks with the wings. That is just wrong, maybe even inhumane."
1,"1st time here. I hear it's really good! Rtf\n\nOkay, here we go in a New York minute I'll sum this up...\n\nTimes Square lived up to the word on the street.  Cheese Stuffed Tortellini is worth every calorie and the savory veggie pizza is a veggie lovers dream come true!\n\nDuring lunch rush seating took place within five minutes, then the food came out steaming hot and ready within twenty minutes.  The waitress and everyone else were friendly and quick with beverage refills.  \n\nI did notice with the small capacity room that if a lot a people are waiting, it can become an issue considering their limited waiting area section & bar.  \n\nI enjoyed the food and overall service, so YELP I recommend this place!"
0,"Williams-Sonoma is not so great as people say it is when it comes to buying their coffee pots. \nFirst of all they really need to hire people who know about coffee pots and also make sure their coffee pots really function. \nI use to love Williams-Sonoma until we started having the worst problems after buying their coffee pots. Cusine Art Coffee pot that cost over $100 didn't work properly. We would end up with burnt tasting coffee. \nBefore that we ordered their Italian coffee maker, Bialetti \""Moka Express\"" Stove Top Espresso Maker. Later on we ended up with metallic tasting coffee and returned it to the same shop. \nSurprisingly after letting them know about the coffee pot problems a month later they still had the same coffee pots there. But on the very bottom shelf. \nWe didn't have any problems getting our money back or store credit. \nBasically don't buy their coffee pots. \nOn top of that when the employee would ask us if we had any questions they couldn't even answer any questions about coffee pots. \nOther than that all their other items are pretty functional. So far."
0,"They way they treat locals on a locals/industry night is horrible.  I went solo to meet friends that were there and entered the first half of the general admission line. As I was allowed to get into the 2nd half. One of the not to bright worker in a black suit suddenly has a problem with my DRESS shoes as if they were not dress code. After that matter was settled. I get a call from my friend that they wouldn't let him in line anymore. He is also a local and the time was at 10:50pm.  First they tell him \""Only guest list and locals\"". He replies he's a local then suddenly its now \""Only guest list\"". Now things have just reach its point of ridiculous. To treat locals so poorly is mind boggling on a night which is designed FOR US.  Oh yeah and I work at the shoppes at the Palazzo which is part of Venetian and at our bar, we're suppose to be on good terms with Tao yet they treat me like dirt. Simply amazing."
1,Why did we stop going to Chili's... We were looking for a dinner place on a Tuesday night and ended up here so we can watch a movie next door. \n\nI ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta. It was sooooo cheesy and the garlic bread was perfect crunchy and soft. Yum!! And we got the dessert which is of course the Chocolate Molten! Soooo delishhhhh and ooey gooey. \n\nWe used their ziosk to order the dessert which was pretty cool and also paid our tab there. So quick and easy. And our server was great as well!\n\nDef need to start coming here again!
0,"I swung in to see what all the hype was all about. Sat at the bar for some time while the arrogant girl blonde bartender was moving as if she was annoyed to be working. Not sure how many blonde female bartenders they have staffed but she was the one with the mens 50's style hairdo. Not sure if the beer was good or bad. The service was so horrendous I closed out and took off with my friends. Funny how service can put the aroma of dog crap into what is suppose to be good tasting juice. Good luck y'all!  I will not be back, show support for the brewery, or pass along the good word."
1,"AYCE !\n\nGreat selection. Great, fresh tasting. \n\nService always came by and made sure we had what we need. \n\nThere is a limit to certain delectable items. \n\n*Rather small establishment. Expect a wait, if you're not there before everyone else. \n*There is are two TV's that are viewable from all seats in the restaurant. \n\nI would AYCE here again!\n+ they take RESERVATIONS !"
0,"Convenient location,  comfortable interior, vegan vibe service.  We split the warm lentil/spinach salad on recommendation of server.  Just OK @ $10, the lentils had a nice herbed flavor and had been simmered in a flavorful stock w some fried pita chips.  The kung pao chicken was very wierd and not even close to expectation-more like bland spagetti sauce over noodles with peanuts and chicken w/chili oil for that LOL \""oriental flavor\""-dish needs to be totally reformulated-chef/owner please google \""kung pao chicken recipes\"" .  Will head to pita jungle next time.  Dr Hummus: stick to your fine retail food products(great baba, hummus, garlic pitas)-you cook poorly."
0,Beware-- vegetarians you are subject to a crappy salad or an ok cheese sandwich (only veggies they have are lettuce and tomatoes). The potato salad and coleslaw also leave something to be desired. My meat eating counter parts advised that the soup was the only thing that they would go back for. Save your money and go elsewhere.
1,"Excellent food, great atmosphere and staff. \n\nWe were visiting from Los Angeles and weren't feeling any of the restaurants on the square [including the most expensive one - my fianc\u00e9 is very 'particular'..]. We were stoked to find Forequarter off the main drag -- the food rivaled the trendy farm to table we get out here. Creative cocktails with rustic ice [big blocks w/out bubbles!], perfectly cooked fish, my fianc\u00e9 could cut his meat with a spoon [think it was a pork thing, which I clearly don't eat] and we're still talking about the cacao nib beet dish. We each had two cocktails, ordered a bit more food than we could manage [but ate it all..] and walked/ rolled out of there for under a hundo [far cry from LA prices..].\n\nHighly recommended - would love to check out their new menu."
0,"Its a dump. Mind you - a very nicely decorated dump. If you wish to hang out and yell over music with out much care what goes in your mouth then this place is for you. If you care about your food you should get in your car and go elsewhere, as this is not a place for Sushi/Rolls lovers. Its mediocre at the very best. Bleah. \n\n\""I dunt like\""\nEugene"
0,"I see so many 4-5 star reviews for this place, but after trying so many menu items, it has to be about the burgers and my experience was particularly bland.  One of my friends and his girlfriend were raving about this place, since they came the previous month and told me that I had to come try it for myself.  We had the following:\n\n**Jalapeno Poppers: Now these are legitimately awesome, and would get them on their own.  Great taste, not to spicy and a perfect sauce.  \n\n**Fries (Truffle Parmesan/Sweet Potato/Regular): These were all delicious, as was their accompanying sauces. \n\n**Hells Kitchen Burger: So shouldn't this be the main event?  I was anxiously awaiting some crazy taste bud exploding moment of ecstasy that never came.  The meat was bland, the cheese didn't have much of a taste and I never felt like I tasted the peppers.  I did get it medium, so I was surprised that it was so devoid of flavors.  What happened to this supposedly insane burger?\n\nService wasn't good.  After we ordered, the waiter mentioned that since the burgers taken 30-45 minutes to make, we might want to think about some appetizers.  Great, thanks for letting us know.  We ordered three (3) appetizers, and they came out about 25 minutes later.  3-4 minutes after that all our burgers came out.  So much for getting appetizers to hold us over for our meal. We all had suspicions that our tab was intentionally  raised, but whatever.  \n\nSince we had players cards, we had a small discount on the food, which amounted to about $20.  He forgot to apply it, and he said he would after he ran our credit/debit cards.  He \""forgot\"" yet again, until I explained to him that he had not ran our players card discount.  He did finally corrected it, but after I spotted it twice.  My party felt like he was doing way too many things on \""purpose\"" to forget to apply the discount.  \n\nThe funny thing is that I did not want to say anything about my experience at BurGR with my friends since one of them really wanted us to go try it out.  It wasn't until we went to Fat Burger right before we were heading back home that two of my friends commented on how much better Fat Burger was than BurGR, at a fraction of the price.  And I completely agreed in not only cost but in flavor.\n\nI might try it out again, since so many people rave about it.  But I may have to share a plate in case I am disappointed again."
0,"I used to be a regular here with my boyfriend. They started learning our names. We were even seated next to Wolfley's football buddies at the anniversary party. Loved this place so much, then it all changed. \n\nWe went back one day to find an almost all new staff, the seats were redone, and the menu overhauled. Most of my favorites were gone and the new things I wanted we're only available after five. I went for lunch. The menu is overwhelming, no more Mac and cheese as a side. Service is not nearly as good and the wings. Now come in 10 instead of 12. So strange to change what works.  \n\nIn the past I have been treated well and with respect. If there was ever a problem they took care of it.  I can honestly say this is no longer true. I have only been there a few small handful of times since the change, and each time I am disappointed. The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes. If you are seated on the patio forget ever getting a refill. I am just so sad that everything ha s changed. I am sad to say they have lost regulars and we are now on the lookout for something new."
1,"I have gone to Holley's since they opened and it remains my go to for meetings, friend time and really special brews.  Heart of Darkness everytime. Love the quiet, airy feel of mornings there.  Perfect way to start the day.  Food is awesome too but i always give in to the cheesiest whatever so cant speak to the healthy options!"
0,There is not enough server so I didnt get help as much as I need and it is very expensive and air conditioner is broken
0,Before coming here we called and were told 20 to 30 min wait however we are being seen 90 min from the time we got here
0,Do not come here for breakfast. The waffles were overcooked; they were crunchy. The quiche was okay. It was seers with some greens but I wouldn't call it a salad because there was no dressing. I would not return here for breakfast. Great view of Bellagio though.
1,"One of the best places for breakfast in town. Little bit of an urban feel. Nice patio. Good service. Yummy pancakes, eggs, bacon, mimosas, fresh coffee. Yum. Wish it was a Sat. morning and I was there right now:)"
1,"Sahra is stunning, there is no doubt about that.  It is incredibly expansive, with a gilded waterfall welcoming you on your way in to what looks like a Saharan Oasis. For as much space as the foyer, walkways, hallways, and lobbies make up, the actual spa itself seems quite small. The locker room is average with a separate bathroom down the hall behind a door which I thought was a little strange and pedestrian. The amenities were C.O Bigelow  and the vanity area had some aerosol deodorant and hairdryers but honestly wasn't much different than a set-up you'd find at an Equinox or nice gym.  There was a hallway with a room off to the right to wait for treatments, and then to the left was a room with the spa: a jacuzzi with waterfall, a steam room, sauna, and a cold water/air room thing. I guess I thought a spa of this stature and price would have a bit more room for the guest to explore and relax in, especially since the waiting room was filled when I was there and I wanted some privacy but didn't want to have to find it in a sauna. \n\nI came to realize that the rest of the giant \""spa\"" is 2-3 floors and hallway after hallway of treatment rooms, unmarked dark wood doors. My boyfriend and I were getting a couples massage and after meeting in the middle area after he came from an identical set up on the other Men's side, we were taken up a flight of stairs to the maze of rooms. Our room was nice and large with two massage tables, a bathtub that we didn't use, and a pretty couch area with candles we didn't get to use. We both got the Balance & Harmony Massage which was a combination of Swedish technique with hot stones and the hot stones were AMAZING. It was relaxing and went incredibly fast though...wasn't completely quiet since he started SNORING!!! The women were nice, a little awkward at the end when one of them went in for an elaborate handshake/zen move thing that was a half hug confusing moment. 20% gratuity is included when you book, overall, nice experience, but I think I was expecting a bit more for the exorbitant price. Sahra is the most I've paid including the Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons..."
1,"Best place in town for large groups. We had 20 in our group and they were very accommodating. Food was great, great margaritas and there were always servers around getting what ever you needed."
1,"Cheapest kegs in town. And don't forget about the 89 cent bags of ice. A regular stop for the ASU Tailgate Team before a game. Phong is mos def the shit. He's been sellin me booze since back when he owned T's liquor on Dorsey. \""What time is it... Par-T-time!\"""
1,"Amazing job, did warranty work, fixed garage door in 30 mints. Had gotten estimates from other companies, 2 of whom told me I needed to buy a new door opener ( would cost $300), and would take a lot longer. They showed me what's wrong, fixed quickly in 30 mints, and only charged me $ 100 (although contracted rate is $125)."
1,"Recommended to this place by Tien. Ordered the Sweet Chili wings. Good sized wings, and a good price. They were crisp and pretty tasty. I think for their sauce they used the Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce. The celery sticks were good. This is located in the same mini-mall as Manna Korean restaurant and Kaba Curry. Nice place to go for an affordable meal in an informal setting."
0,"The service is so bad as is the food.  The Manager could care less.  The waitress lost our credit card but delivered the check and never told us.\n\nIt took 28 mins to get check and we were late for event.  The food is so bad, the last 2 times I chose to not eat at the Restaurant as the concession food is better at a High School football game.\n\nAvoid!!!!!"
0,"Place can't hold a candle to Luv-it. They must use the word \""concrete\"" very loosely because all i got was soft-serve custard with my two toppins of choc. chips and coconut mixed in blizzard style. Too bad that i could have saved 3 bucks and ordered a scoop of custard with a topping and mix that up by myself. Concretes in the Midwest are packed tight, but no suck luck here. It is also embarrassing that you can't make more than two flavors? Luv-it has those special flavors each day and the vanilla over there is way tastier than in the suburbs. Back to drawing board Mister D."
0,"This review is more about the experience with the executive chef than the food at Booger restaurant.\n\nSo we were at Burgr restaurant and had just ordered a $ 15 burger when I noticed that Christine from Hell's Kitchen was standing around talking to two of her friends. I didn't want to interrupt so I waited 10 minutes before one of her friends left. That's when I decided to ask her if she could take a picture with us. I gave my camera to a waitress and politely began to request, \""I am sorry to interrupt...\"" Even before I can get the next words out, she RUDELY said twice while raising her finger, \""Oh, but you are interrupting!\"" Never have i been so disgusted/appalled at one's behavior toward another polite human, especially after waiting so patiently.  \n\nThe nerve of this person. She is merely a reality star and she thinks that she is a hot celebrity. I am not sure if even most real celebrities would behave in such a rude manner. It must be because she knows that her food SUCKS and that her gig will be over soon and her 5 seconds of fame will be up.\n\nMr. Ramsey, you made a big mistake in selecting Christine as your winner and executive chef. \n\nAlso, the food was bland and the meat was overcooked, so i would not recommend going to a place where the executive chef is rude and the place is overpriced!"
0,"I'm staying near the Desert Ridge area for about a month and have been here twice. However, after the last experience, I think it will be a while since I come here again or recommend this place to friends.\n\nThe first time I came here was around lunch time since we were at Desert Ridge and looking for a bite to eat.  We ordered a combo of appetizers and entrees.\n\nMac & Cheese Bites with Truffle Dip - it is okay, just little balls of mac and cheese that is later fried. When you bite into it, it is airy and there isn't a whole lot of taste to it.\n\nZucchini Fritti with Truffle Dip - I wouldn't recommend this appetizer again unless they keep an eye on how long they fry the zucchini.  The idea sounds good, long strips of zucchini that is fried almost like thin strips of chips, however, what came out was less than desired.  Most of what was on our plate was over fried. I don't mean \""golden brown\"" either, but like dark brown, inedible pieces.  We didn't complain to the waiter but he must've seen that most of the plate was untouched.\n\nPenne Rustica - roasted chicken, shrimp, rosemary cream, prosciutto, parmesan. This was alright, I thought the pasta was a bit overcooked and not al dente, but it wasn't mushy either.\n\nSweet Corn & Clam Fettuccine- clams, pancetta, celery, cream, white wine, green onion.  My friend ordered this and substituted with penne pasta instead. She seemed to like it although found it to be a bit too heavy as she got to the end of the dish.\n\nService was fine on our first visit.\n\nThen about two weeks later I took my aunt/uncle who were visiting from out of town. We decided to stop here for a late lunch. It was around 1:45 pm by now.\nWhen we entered, most of the dining area was empty with the exception of two small tables that had people who were eating. The annoying part of this was that we waited for almost 10 minutes before anyone came by to actually seat us, we basically gone unnoticed and there was 3 of us with 2 more on their way. I had to approach someone to mention we would like to be seated. If we didn't already arrange to meet my aunt and uncle to meet us there already, I would've left the restaurant and gone elsewhere. \n \nWe ordered a few appetizers to share, and I mentioned to our table not to order the zucchini fritti after last time's bad experience.\n\nCalamari Fritti - fried calamari was actually pretty good. The batter was light and there was a fair amount of calmari to share.\n \nLobster-Stuffed Clams- clams, pancetta, garlic breadcrumbs, red pepper aioli. This was a disappointing item. It sounded good from the description, but the clams were tiny, couldn't find much (if any lobster) and you tasted more breadcrumbs than anything else.\n\nShrimp Portofino - jumbo shrimp, capellini, spinach, mushrooms, pine nuts, lemon butter. This this was fine, perhaps a bit too much oil for my taste.\n \nThe rest of the group ordered the combo lunch specials and then another ordered the sweet corn & clam fettuccine. \n\nThe service this time wasn't very good. Yes, she came to get our drinks when we first sat down, but we had to flag her down to take our orders and also to get us some more bread and refill our drinks midway.  Mind you, this place had a total of 3 tables including us and there were a few waitstaff working that day.  Paying for the bill took forever as well.\n\nOverall, the food isn't terrible here but there are some dishes better than others. Service I wish would be more consistent."
1,"We had the pork shoulder , shrimp. Enchaldis am ceviche.  All was good but pork shoulder was great.  Was a splitable dish for the 3 of us.  Tender, lots of flavor, great dish!!!"
1,My kids love the zoo... The membership is cheap and is a really good deal if you plan on going often.
1,"I can not say enough good things about greka pita. I LOVE greek good, and this place is legit. From the owners, to the shwarma. Please give all your money to this place because I eat here like 4 times a week."
1,"I don't think their is a better restaurant  in Las Vegas.  \n\nFrangria, steak, frites and watching the Bellagio fountains."
0,"I'm in from out of town and wanted to watch the Buffalo game while having lunch. I walked up to the bar and asked if it was on anywhere, was told no. I asked if they could put it on one of their many TVs and was again told no because the manager said the TVs were staying on the games they are already on. Now the place was not full by any means and I could have easily had the game out on one of the small TVs. But not even double checking is just lazy and terrible customer service. So here I am literally around the corner at Buffalo Wild Wings instead and I will be very reluctant to try them again over the next few weeks while I am here."
1,"Food- The complimentary chips and salsa are delicious. The chips are homemade and a little bit thicker than most restaurant tortilla chips. The salsa is also really good.\nI typical get a mixture of side dishes and mix them together to make a \""naked\"" burrito or burrito bowl. The beans are perfectly seasoned and really flavorful. Same with the rice. Their charred corn is always cooked well. I did get the carrots and jalepenos one time, and it was SO spicy that I couldn't eat it. I have a medium tolerance for spice.\n\nI also enjoy the White Peach and Hibiscus Margarita. It has a great flavor. \nMy husband typically gets the Machaca Burrito made Enchilada style. It comes in a cast iron type individual casserole dish. \n\nService- The servers are really attentive and helpful, giving suggestions of menu items and accommodating special requests.\n\nDecor- The design of the restaurant is really cool. Nice blues and whites, huge industrial type light fixtures. A nice patio and stocked bar in the middle of the main dining room.\n\nIn all fairness, we don't frequent Blanco, because you can get Mexican food that is just as good at a cheaper price point, but I do enjoy splurging on the ambiance of Blanco once in a while."
1,"Great local Pittsburghesque Diner.  I had delicious pumpkin pancakes with eggs and \""kielbasy\"".  Very good, the kielbasy was not like any I had before, I suppose all kielbasa has it's own local flavor.\n\nInteresting people watching, from the locals, tourists, tattooed staff and Pittsburgh's finest.   Everything is cooked behind a low counter - you can see all the activity - looks crazy back there.  The booths are not very comfortable, straight backed and Formica topped (adds to the charm?)  There is a strange mural on the wall, Greek mythology themed with Pan and others, labeled as a prop from the movie \""Passed Away\"".\n\nReally enjoyed it, would go back and recommend to others.  Fun and funky area to shop too."
1,"Ich war das erste Mal mit einem Freund hier. Den D\u00f6ner bieten sie in H\u00e4hnchenfleisch oder aus Kalbfleisch in eigener Produktion an. Ich habe beides probiert und fand sie lecker. \nVor allem das Kalbfleisch ist Yaprak-D\u00f6ner, also Bl\u00e4tter-D\u00f6ner aus (fast) reinem Fleisch. Das geh\u00f6rt generell zu den teuersten und qualitativ hochwertigen D\u00f6nern. Den kann ich empfehlen. Ich esse meist Yufka-D\u00f6ner und trinke dazu selbst gemachten Ayran. Insgesamt lecker. Zu dem Fett gibt es eine Besonderheit.\nBei Hackfleisch Spie\u00dfen ist die Mischung fettiger, aber man schmeckt es nicht gross raus. (verstecktes Fett)\nBeim Bl\u00e4tter-D\u00f6ner wird von aussen gefettet, damit die Fleisch-Bl\u00e4tter nicht zu trocken werden. Leider erscheint und schmeckt er dadurch fettiger.\nDas sollte man dabei beachten. Die Bedienung ist in t\u00fcrkischer Sprache nett und h\u00f6flich. \nAber in deutscher Sprache sind sie leider nicht so galant. \nDas liegt nicht an den deutschsprachigen Kunden, sondern meistens daran, dass die meisten Ausl\u00e4nder dies in deutscher Sprache nicht ausreichend gut k\u00f6nnen. \nDa m\u00fcssten sie mehr \u00fcben. Vielleicht sollten die Kritiker dies bedenken und in den deutschen Sprachkenntnissen mithelfen. In der Summe komme ich gerne hierher."
0,"My boyfriend had an IPA which he said was great.  I had an amber beer but would rather have had a wine or lighter beer but they didn't gave that as a choice.  The place is a work in progress.   Needs some ambiance for sure. Dim the lights, add some mirrors (because it is so small, the mirrors will open it up a bit) add wine to your menu and chill your glasses.  Offer a lighter beer choice too.  Menu needs improvement."
0,Took weeks to get my car after I purchased it when they told me it would only be one week.
1,"Random stop for gas, poddy break and eats.  Any place with \""Pie\"" in the name sounds okay by me!\n\nThe order:\n\nChili & Corn Bread\nPotato Skins\nRhubarb Crumb Pie\nCherry Crumb Pie\n\nAmple servings.  Nice, down home country service.  Old West (Original) decor.  \n\nService - 5 stars\nEntrees - 3 stars\nPIE - 5 stars\n\nI would drive hundreds of miles, just to get that pie!  Go for the poddy, stay for the pie!"
1,"This was not going out to eat, it was a true dining experience! The food was fantastic, the service was outstanding and manager, William Mischke made sure we got the most beautiful view of the city. My girlfriend and I are already planning our next visit. I highly recommend this restaurant. You will not be disappointed."
1,"Maybe i was just really hungry. The food was delish and very satisfying! Good service, too. :)"
1,"As all previous yelpers have stated...They saw the reviews, took a chance and it paid off. \n\nAfter being given a 1.5week window for repair on our dryer that went out, I panicked (freaked out) as I have a newborn and a toddler (Plus a husband and me) where laundry is 24/7 and I wouldn't have survived.  \n\nCalled and got a same day appointment and Vladimir showed up and helped fix the dryer and gave me tips on what l needed to do. When we need anything fixed in the future as far as appliances, we will use him. Very nice man and honest. \n\nHighly recommend."
1,"This is a great place!! I'm a big eating caveman, so I got two sandwiches. I ordered the pizza and the turkey with bacon. The pizza had a fantastic flavor. The turkey is exactly what you would expect. The bacon made the sandwich pop though. Very fast service. Great lunch spot."
1,"Stopped here for a quick bite before show.  The place was very crowded but seats by the bar area open.  The food was excellent - seabass and asparagus appetizer.  Great atmosphere, by far a better experience than Japonaise!"
1,"The food is very good and I really like the ambience.  Lots of choices for trying to eat vegetarian and they're willing to improvise the menu if there's something you want. I'm still not sure about it's location in Tivoli, which appears to be a shopping center with only restaurants (?)."
0,"Let's start with what I liked.\n\nThe cat.  Who doesn't like being greeted at the door by a cute kitty?  (Someone who is allergic to cats like I am...but, I still thought the cat was cute.)\n\nThe parrot!  So sweet.  Seemed to take a liking to me.\n\nBut wait a minute..is this a pet store or a vintage shop?  5 stars for pet store.  2 stars for vintage shop.\n\nWhenever I travel, I go on a hunt for great vintage shops.  Living within minutes of some of the best shops in the country, my standards are pretty high.  When I read that this shop in Las Vegas was the \""biggest vintage store in the world\"" well, I was sold!  Really?  Biggest in the world?  Who wouldn't want to pay them a visit?\n\nI have most definitely been to bigger vintage stores.  Size is not everything, but the selection of items was not that great.  I always find tons of things to try on, but here, I was disappointed.  Nothing struck my fancy.  The prices were also a bit high for what the items were.  \n\nYou might like this place, I suggest giving it a try if you are in the area.  I wasn't too thrilled with it and probably would not go back next time I'm in Vegas.  Actually, I might.  I'd go for the cat."
1,"Look, when you've grown tired of the $8 imports at your hotel bar, find your way to Burger Bar for some of the best beer in Las Vegas. Sampled a dozen or so during two trips the week before last, and was particularly impressed by both the Belgian and the East Cost (i.e. - Dogfish) selections. 25 drafts and 100 bottles - I think that's right. Enjoyed both meals - the second was an All-American burger followed by the Dessert Burger - one that must be tasted to be believed. Friendly, attentive staff. Quality food. Outstanding beer selection. Reasonable prices. I'll be back."
0,The worst Macaroni Grill I've ever been to!  Do not waste your time!!!
1,"Not only is it one of the most badass museums you'll see in your life, it also offers the most outstanding experience you can think of. Yes, you get a nicely laid-out history and great exhibition, but you also get to drive a real-life simulation with training and explanations. Also, the souvenir shop rocks! Basically, this museum is awesome."
0,"The food is BAD and so DISAPPOINTED! I feel awful to write this. But we all work hard for a living. When we pay to eat out.....we do expect it to taste good. \n\nOrange Chicken - Over cooked and was so stringy. Couldn't enjoy it at all. Sauce didn't taste right either. Very bland. Didn't have that slightly spicy orange sweet flavor.\n\nEgg Fried Rice - NO flavor whatsoever. I added that sweet red sauce to it, which made it taste a lot better. \n\nCrab Puff - I actually think this is the only thing I liked. \n\nBeef and Broccoli - Overcooked and no flavor, per family member who ate it. \n\nChicken in Garlic Sauce - My BF ordered it. The chicken was cooked well and it tasted good. He wanted spicy, and it was spicy. \n\nEgg Drop Soup - Bland, no flavor. Worse we all have ever had.\n\nAgain I feel bad having to write a very negative review. But having to wait an hour and a half for delivery of the food (took 30 min longer than it was supposed too) and costing $35 for the 3 of us to eat. It was a waste of money. I wish we had gone elsewhere."
0,"My mom has been taking her car here for many years and they keep screwing her royally.   They supposedly fixed an oil leak & charged her $1,000, she noticed when she got home that the oil was still leaking so she took it back to Big O and they told her that it was a different oil leak and charged her another $1,000.  To this day her oil is still leaking.  Every time she goes in there to get her oil changed they tell her that something else is wrong with her car.  Her car was in good shape before she took it to Big O, now it is ruined by them."
0,"This place is great if you are looking to wash your dog by yourself. They layout for self-wash is good. The reason I am giving this place 1 star is because of my horrible experience with the groomer named Michelle. I called to inquire about grooming and was told that it includes a wash, nail trim, ear cleaning and haircut. I made my appointment 2 weeks in advance.\n\nWhen it was time for my appointment, I dropped my dog off and the groomer was not friendly at all. She just told me to lock my dog up in their cage. She didn't even take a second to ask me anything or talk to me since she was busy working with another dog. I left and waited, it took her 6 hours to call me back to pick my dog up. \n\nI had my friend pick up my dog since I couldn't. She paid the grooming fee plus tip. Once I saw my dog, it came to my surprise that his hair wasn't cut, nails weren't trimmed, and his left ear was super red. I called the groomer to voice my concern and instead of making it right with me, she made an excuse saying and I quote \""you should have clarified and said what you wanted done with your dog\"". I then said I didn't have a chance since she made it so hard to talk to her and I did mention what I wanted when I made the appointment (plus I shouldn't have to, I was informed that the grooming package included nail trim and hair cut so that's what I expected) and her response was, again I quote \""I don't remember every appointment I book!\"" how unprofessional!! Maybe you should write it down or at least be friendly enough to talk to your customers!\n\nTo make matters worse, my dog got an ear infection in his left ear which cost me $60.00 to treat. It was difficult trying to put the ear drops on my dog. After the 10 day treatment, the experience left my dog scared to be touched on his head and by his ears.\n\nIf you don't want to go through hell, DO NOT go here for grooming! You'll waste your money, be misinformed, not get the service you want, give trauma to your dog and be treated unprofessionally."
1,I wish there were more indoor seating. It's like a less awesome Casey Moore's with older people.
1,"I tried the walleye sandwich for the second time last night and it is a sandwich to be recognized. The only thing wrong with it is that it is, somehow, too big. But believe me when I say I will try to eat the whole thing every time.\n\nMy significant other ordered the house burger, which was delicious as well . We have been here in the past and tried specials, cheese plates and lazy susans.  While nothing has been bad (I was impressed with their cheese platters especially) I have yet to have anything that is equally as delightful as the walleye sandwich. \n\nI highly recommend the Old Fashioned for dinner or drinks. It offers a casual atmosphere and a great location on the square."
1,"Pros \n- nice ambiance \n- delicious tacos, we all liked the chicken ones the most. \n- good salsa\n\nCon\n- only 1 waitress"
1,"I really enjoyed watching baseball here during the A's Spring Training. I sat in Section D mostly and the view was amazing and the shade was much needed. I liked the beer garden with the picnic tables and the chicken taco stand was very delicious. The ushers were very helpful when we needed to find our seats initially and seemed to know the couple who we sat next to for all of the games; I later learned that they come every year and sit in the same spot! \n\nThe only downside, and it's not even that bad, is this place is cash only. They provide ATMS but the service charge is $3.95/transaction. That adds up if you forget to bring cash all the time and there isn't a close by place to get cash back at near the stadium.\n\nI would love to visit this stadium again but, sadly, not for the Oakland A's Spring Training in 2015 since they are moving to Mesa. \n\nGreat place all around and a good variety of adult beverages. Perfect for the family to come and watch America's past time."
1,"I have eaten here a few times, not as much as I would like. \n\nGreat sense of community here.\n\nAmazing home style cooking, the guy in the back really knows what hes doing.\n\nQuick, friendly, attentive service.\n\nGood looking chicks that work here.\n\nPrices are great once you taste the food and realize how much effort and care they put behind it.\n\nWhat else can you look for in a little diner cafe?"
1,Healthy and tasty! Gotta try the soy fries!
0,"Disgusting dog food and service. They tried to rip me off by saying this is \""how it's cooked\"". Fuck that! My dog wouldn't eat this garbage. Beware!!!!!"
0,"We were so thrilled when we got booked at the Delano because our room was gorgeous and it was a very special trip for us. I was ready to post 5 start reviews (despite the $25 per night mandatory fee for internet/gym access and the $4 for a cup of coffee in your room) on Yelp and Tripadvisor until I checked my credit card and realized I was charged 4 times for my stay. $1,000 when you're on vacation, on the night the love of your life proposed to you, leaves a pretty annoying black mark on such a special day. \n\nCustomer service to get our refund was a complete nightmare, waiting on hold for more than an hour and was then passed around from one agent to another for another hour, until, of course, I was hung up on and had to start all over. The craziest thing about being charged 4 times for our room was that we had already paid in full before walking through the door, the mandatory credit card on hold for \""incidentals\"" was the one that was charged four times! Thank goodness we didn't use our debit card to hold the room and used our empty credit card, otherwise it could have been disastrous."
1,"This is how beer fests are done. Lots of samples to be tried and a terrific layout that encourages walking and prevents insane crowding. What's better than getting to walk around a cool area all whilst sampling delicious beers? And the beer folks really care about what they're serving up. The majority make a point of telling you about the beers and answering questions. So yeah, it's awesome."
1,It was super quick to get a marriage license here. Came in at 8:23 and left by 8:40. All it took was a little money and a few moments away from my drivers license now I'm inches away from being married. The workers didn't look to friendly but I suppose that's how they wanted to have the professional look? Come here for quick service for sure.
1,"I love this place whenever I need a quick bite, especially happy hour!\n\nThe wings here are cooked to be nice and juicy on the inside, but crispy on the outside! I am a fan of the golden variety, which has the same spice levels as your classic wings, but is a bit sweeter. I'd advise coming to specials, happy hours and select nights, to get a dozen wings for 5 bucks. Sweet deal!\n\nThe homemade onion rings here are perhaps the best I've eaten, and the burgers are great for a good bite. I don't know about other people, but my BBQ Bacon Burger was cooked evenly to a medium rare consistency, which I liked.\n\nThe staff is decent, and the time for food and refills is short even on busy nights!\n\nI'm not even a sports fan, but I can dig this sports grill."
1,"Living downtown leaves you with limited options when it comes to grocery and liquor stores, so to say that the addition of the Phoenix Public Market Urban Grocery and Wine Bar is welcome is an understatement.\n\nUrban Grocery reminds me a lot of Foodie's Urban Market in Boston (but on a much smaller scale), and as is the case with most urban markets, the selection limited.   While Urban Grocery does offer a wide range of products (fresh meat, dairy, produce, dry goods) one could never possibly do all of their grocery shopping here.  That is the point of urban markets and groceries though- they offer unique items that you may need at the moment.  Or unique items you can combine into one specific dish. Given its connection to the Downtown Phoenix Public Market you can find a lot of the goods that are from the vendors at the market - jams or honey for example.   I think it is best to think of this as a boutique shopping experience rather than a grocer experience, and know going in that they may not have what you are looking for it if you need something really specific. \n\nThe biggest drawback, for me, is the hours.   I hope in the future that this will change, I would really appreciate a store open on the weekends and past 8pm.  I hope that as time goes on that they respond to the need of the residents in the area and provide more opportunities for us to shop there.  It does have promise as a lunch location, and I am looking forward to checking it out for that purpose. The space where the seating is located is surrounded by large windows so it is very bright, yet is separated from the market in such a way that you do not feel as if you are sitting in the aisle of a store.\n\nFor now I am giving Urban Grocery 4 stars, it really fills a need in our neighborhood and shows promise."
1,"This is a review on Cafe Caruma's Happy Hour.\n\n5$ appetizers!!! YUM.\nWe had some really great things... but the number one thing I need to recommend (I would really be a jerk if I didn't) are the sweet potato fries. I've had sweet potato fries before... but these not only came with ketchup, but a side of warm maple syrup. The mixture of the fry and syrup was something sweet, delicious and dreamy. It was like, a mini-French Toast... without being soggy.\n\nOther highlights... 2$ domestic, 3$ premium draft beers. And I think this is a summer special, but 5$ full size Patron margaritas! Woo woo!"
1,"While I didn't go to CMU or Pitt, which share this beloved place as a go-to spot for good food and drink, I still frequent it when I'm in the city. The vibe is an old college town bar from the 70s or 80s. In fact, my mom, who went to Pitt, said it hasn't changed much over the years (and that's not a bad thing).\n\nThere are two reasons I go here: \n\n1. 10 dollar bottles of wine. Yes, you heard me. 10 DOLLARS. They are actually decent wines, too! The Sea Glass Pinot Noir is my favorite. \n\n2. Fast and fresh food with quality ingredients. I usually get the NY Strip steak salad and I've never once gotten sick from food allergy cross contamination. The meat is always seasoned well and tender. \n\nYou really can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches, salads or other bar fare. I admit I have not tried many entrees due to food allergies. The only reason they lost a star for me was because during my last visit, the waiter put a breadstick on top of my salad (I am allergic to it) and they had to make me a new one. Honest mistake, but I did warn him about my allergies prior to the meal. And anyway, it was more of an inconvenience for them than me! However, I didn't get sick, so life is good!"
1,"Tanta qualit\u00e0. \nMangiare uno di questi hamburger \u00e8 come mangiare una bistecca. Vera carne, spessa e cotta davvero bene. \n\nLocale carino ma niente di speciale."
1,"It's like your back yard, but with a bartender and someone else tending the grill. Skunk Creek Flats (east side frontage road off I-17 just north of Jomax) is a great addition to the N. Phoenix neighborhoods and I'm looking forward to good times to come hanging out there. The food thus far has been adequate, but the real draw is atmosphere and live bands when there going. That said, the cheese burgers are pretty solid. \n\nNow all they need is to throw some Buffet on every once in a while, and I'd feel like I was in Rocky Point! :)\n\nCheck it out!"
0,Horrible food very salty and greasy. They forgot one of our orders but the food was so bad we canceled it and left you pay for what you get gross never again
0,"GROSS. I had one bite of each item of food I brought back to my table. Not one dish was edible. Even the rice was overcooked. The salt and pepper shakers were sticky, i had to ask for new silverware TWICE. My fianc\u00e9e and I refused to pay but offered to pay for our soda. Luckily they agreed. Will not be returning to this establishment. DO NOT EAT HERE!"
0,"Food was ok.  Went with a group of people and each meal ordered was considered \""ok\"".  One complaint I will share is that we asked to replace fries with onion rings on one of the burger plates.  We were told that it would cost .99 cents extra, which was fine (usually there is a cost to \""upgrade\"" to onion rings).  So was very surprised with the burger came with four (4)...yes, four small onion rings.  Stick with fries next time!  \n\nThe huge eclair caught our eye when we went by the bakery case and we were excited to splurge with one.  Skip it, folks.  It was very dry and the filling was skimpy (actually it was thicker in the dead center of this huge eclair but overall, the experience was not worth the cost.  \n\nMost likely won't be back to this cafe.  We actually chose to eat here because we attended a concert at the casino."
1,"Superfan! The Boulders is a fantastic retreat in Scottsdale (or Carefree technically). \n\nThey have houses and small apartments/condos. When I was there we stayed on a nice cul-de-sac for a family get together. The houses are gorgeous and have huge porches. You get state of the art appliances including washers & driers as well as grills and in our case a smoker! So if you're planning a bit of an extended vacation these homes are a great way to save some money by making your own food.\n\nOnce you're in the place you'll never want to leave. For the price of your room there are a lot of included perks: shuttle service around the property, all the pools, the features at the spa and activities at the spa (like yoga and water aerobics). For an extra fee there's more stuff to do: spa treatments, bikes, guided tours, and sports like golf & tennis (I think the sports are extra, I didn't actually do any, it was vacation after all).\n\nIt's also a gorgeous place for your wedding plans. If you love the outdoors of Arizona, you should really consider getting married here. There are some beautiful locations and one even has a nice, big waterfall in the background! \n\nThe food and drinks on the property are a little on the pricey side, but I think that's normal at a resort. I'd just say go to the ABC store (or that MASSIVE Whole Foods) and pick up your drinks and make 'em yourself."
0,As my first Cirque du Soleil show. It was kind of disappointing. \n\nThe show really needed a storyline. Annoying baby and a wondering snail just doesn't due it. \n\nI kept asking everyone else if their other shows were like this. The others are better. Pay the extra money.
0,"Huge line. Feels like waiting in line at Disney Land.  They got machines that look like are for self check in, but people aren't allowed to use them because apparently a live person has to man them, and they got none. This looks like the last century, and everyone is laughing. Hertz should be ashamed of themselves... One hour flight from San Francisco, 2 hours in line at Hertz rental..."
1,"International Newsagents is a good place to make a pit stop for water or for a packet of crisps, but its main purpose is to provide the people of Edinburgh with international news.\n\nWith its wide selection of magazines and newspapers from across the globe, it's probably one of the only places in town you can pick up a newspaper from your hometown (if you're not from Edinburgh). They have everything, from the Washington Post to French newspapers (that I couldn't read or tell ya about, because my French is regrettably shameful). Le sigh! \n\nso even if I can't understand what the French paper said, someone who is here on business or indeed lives here will very much appreciate being able to pick up the latest scoop from back home. \n\nAnd, like Eleanor, the army of bagpipe playing dolls displayed in the window dolls did invoke a giggle or two!"
1,"Lovely owner...\nGreat staff, cheap prices and healthy choices!\nLove love love!!!"
1,"I typically buy breakfast or lunch here once a weekend.  Highly recommended.  They have good lunch specials where you get a good sandwich, chips and a drink for around $6.  Also, I recommend the bagels and breakfast burritos.  I have been coming here for years. and would definitely recommend to people looking for a good local bagel shop."
0,"Definitely a failure. Premium pricing and Motel 6 service. The place is nice enough inside. The rooms are clean and modern. The towels were HORRIBLE motel six scratchy (VERY) and thin. Where Bellagio and other premium hotels have ice waiting for you, Aria is \""self service\"". \n\nThe service is abysmal. The card key did not work. It took the floor manager (who we happened to see while trying to get into our room) 20 minutes to get approval to let us in with his pass key. Then because we were running late we called down and asked for the key to be sent up. It took 5 minutes for them to answer the phone, then the actually ASKED US TO COME DOWN AND GET THE KEY. First class my x$%&-! As a matter of fact, EVERY call took forever to get answered (room service, housekeeping, and front desk)\n\nWe've stayed at many similarly priced hotels in Vegas. Bellagio, Venetian, and TI are better. Go there."
0,"This place is dirty, and the staff are more interested in talking amongst themselves and eating than helping customers.  One dressing room (the second is filled with junk).  Not for me, but you go! animal lovers."
0,"Very disappointed in the two girls working here tonight. Most of the toppings were put away by the time we got there @ 9:40 pm. Plain frozen yogurt tonight for the kids. They did not offer any samples and we had to eat in the car since the chairs were already put away. Drive a little farther and go to either Razzleberriez (awesome service and open until 11 pm), or the Yogurtology in Arrowhead."
0,My friends wanted to come here so Me being the Awesome friend I agreed :) \n\nI think I came on a bad night.  I didn't see any skills on the pole... \n\nMusic was really good.  If you like booty shakin with a hint of Ghetto.. Ok more than a hint lol this spot is for you.  This place lacks variety.  Different flavors for different people.. I didn't see that here...maybe I came at a bad night.  On the other hand Our waitress was very nice.  \n\nI did like that they have a taco truck right outside ;). Good idea on their part.
1,"I know that I've had Tom's BBQ before. I've seen them at events, but this was the first time I went inside to eat. We walked right in at lunchtime, but it wasn't too overly busy. There were people there enjoying the BBQ, but it was calm, relaxed and the food didn't take long. Most places are much more hectic during lunch. Billy was so friendly! We loved the BBQ and Chicago feel in Arizona. She also let us try some fried mac n cheese. YUM! I loved it and would have probably not known to order it as a side on my own. Thanks so much!!"
1,"I come through Waverley Station quite a lot, as most of my family live in London, I am always coming back and forth and as such I have become quite familiar with the station. There are currently works undergoing at the station, to make it look part of the 21st century, which is good as from the outside it does look a bit ugly.\nThe best thing about the station is it's location, directly on Princes Street, right in the heart of the station and within direct reach of other transport services with a taxi rank, airport buses and general bus services just outside. \nThere are a fair amount of shops and places to pick up some food or something to read for your journey, but seeing as Princes Street is just up the Waverley steps, it would make sense to go there to get some food and drinks instead of paying much higher prices in the station. However, many people don't actually leave themselves enough time to do so, myself included, and if this happens I tend to go to Upper Crust, which has a good range of snacks."
1,"This is a really nice caf\u00e9 at St Zotique and St Denis. The interior is very pleasing, the service friendly, and the food good. One small complaint is that the veggie burger completely fell apart as I was eating it -- I would not order it again. But the fries and salad were really great. Will definitely be going back to try other stuff on the menu!"
1,"The BT Cheeseburger is large and very tasty, certainly enough to fill you up without needing any sides.\nIf I'm ever in Charlotte again, this will definitely be on my list of places to visit."
0,"I've literally been here 3 times in a row and been to about 4-5 of their drive-in spots didn't work. Pressed the red button 3 times in each space and nobody answered. I understand if they don't work but if they don't put an out of order sticker on them. This place sucks. A lot. But hey, it's sonic. Not setting the bar too high."
0,"Skip it.\n\nWorse meal of our trip, in both food and service, a true disappointment as Emeril is one of our favorite Chef!  No comparison to Robuchen's or Rick Moonen's RM seafood or even Shibuya or Wolfgang's.  I had better food at the fish and chip stand in NYNY.\n\nThe crab trio tasting was less than memorable.  The king crab was ok, the rest meh.\nThe oysters had so many loose shell shards in them, and they didn't give us any utensil to serve the condiments.\n\nWe are from boston, so maybe we are a little spoiled by proper lobster bisque.  But what we got was salty and less than tasteful.  It was made edible only after we asked for some cream fraiche.\n\nThe only thing that was somewhat decent was the grilled whole fish wife got, even if it was a bit overcooked.  My own entree was so unmemorable, I can't even remember what I had now.\n\nOh definitely skip the Creme Brulee or rather egg custard, we left ours after one spoon.\n\nThe service was terrible, from the hostesses to the waiter, felt like we were in a road side diner (actually that maybe an insult to some of the diners we had visited that had awesome and attentive service).  Amateur night is how I would describe it.\n\nWe had ordered a bottle of sparkling, which the server took away and did not bother to return and refill until end of our meal.\n\nWe had a show to rush to and when the waiter came to drop off the bill we even discussed it and he watched me put my card on the table.  But instead of picking it up, he turned around and left.  Ahmmm, really? \n\nTruly a disappointment..."
1,"One of the things I love best about travelling to Mexico is stopping at the street taco vendors and getting some authentic cooked to order carne asada dollar tacos.  \n\nTaco Azteca brought that exact thing to Las Vegas, and they do it WONDERFULLY.  There is a restaurant storefront, but I am not entirely sure you can go inside (I've never seen anyone but an employee go in) because the sell everything from a food cart in their parking lot.  I have only ever stopped by here after dark, and I'm pretty sure they aren't open in the daytime (or maybe that's when you can go inside to dine...I'm not sure and don't really care.)   \n\nLadies and Gentlemen, if you have not eaten at Taco Azteca, you are missing out on one of the best culinary experiences in Vegas.   This little food cart has been featured on Anthony Bourdain, and it's not hard to see why the producers picked this place for a feature spot.  AMAZING.  Oh, and there is always a line of Mexicans waiting to get their orders, which to me is a pretty strong sign of good authentic Mexican food.  \n\nTheir tacos are a buck a piece, and 50 cents to add cheese (and who wouldn't want cheese?).  They offer traditional fillings like carne asada (steak), carnitas (shredded pork), and pollo (chicken), or if you are feeling adventurous, they have lengua (tongue) and cabeza (which I'm pretty sure is cow brain - I'm not that adventurous)\n\nI cannot say this strongly enough.  Do yourself a favor and FIND THIS PLACE.  Okay...now i'm hungry.  I'm thinking i may have to hit this place tonight.\n\n***Expert tip:  Ask them for some lime wedges and squeeze a lime on each taco just before you eat it.  It enhances the flavor of the meat and makes your tastebuds want to sing with joy."
1,"I was in the neighborhood and decided to stop by for a quick bite - not knowing anything about it. Having been the previous locations of Dish and The Kitchen, I thought it would be something similar... but was surprised to see it was more of a take out / healthy tv dinner concept. I got a great little intro to the place from the staff and purchased their turkey meatloaf/mashed sweet potato recommendation and warmed it up there... YUM! My only hesitation was that the packaging was in plastic... and microwaving plastic just doesn't seem healthy. The prices are reasonable and if you are looking for glutton free - there are a ton of options... however it would be nice if they explored different packaging... maybe the paper boxes? I'd go again for the food, but may opt to bring home and warm up on a plate or in glass..."
1,"Too much hype - Amazing Subs\n\nI had a car appointment not too far from here, so I decided to check this place out. I heard about this place from various different forums. People from Toronto, on the radio, friends, and advertising. All of them saying that this is best pizzeria and sub place in Montreal. Well I will have to cut the short on that.\n\nThe pizza is ok, the dough for me is too thick. I like thin dough with longs of toppings.\n\nThe sub however, those are definitely one of the best in Montreal. I high recommended going here and trying a sub. Don't get hyped up on the pizza....get a sub and you will be pleasantly satisfied.\n\nOne downfall, its not really a sit in place. So don't worry what it looks like, just go with a buddy or your significant and grab a sub."
0,"We went here a few days after Christmas for a special family dinner.  My family of 4 asked for recommendations from the concierge at Cosmopollitan and she suggested this restaurant.  We made reservations to go after our Michael Jackson show at 9PM. \n\nFrom the minute we showed up and were seated at a circular table towards the center of the dining area we were immediately disappointed.  It took our waiter at least 5 minutes before they even acknowledged us.  My mom had time to go to the bathroom and come back and still we waited.  When our waiter finally came my dad was very irritated- we were all ravenous and grumpy.  When the waiter read off the specials he did so with an aire of complete elitism and arrogance. It put our whole table off and we immediately commented on his attitude of complete boredom with us.  He read off the specials quickly slurring his words and not making eye contact.  From there the whole tone of the dinner was set.  Briefly our order:\nBottle of Wine- all are insanely overpriced\nGrilled Octopus- amazing, bet thing we ordered, very small potion- they say its family style sizes.. they are small sizes\nDozen Oysters- half kumamoto half kushi- I love oysters and these were extremely disappointing. Each one was full of grit and shell. we were all spitting pieces out after every bite. The mignonet and raspberry sauces they serve alongside were far too similar.\nMilos Special- the biggest rip off of all. $30 dollars for basically fried zucchini? SO OVERPRICED and not very special. \nDessert: Svigous- basically fried donuts with bitter honey and walnut on top- nobody ate it...\nUltimately my whole family letft the restaurant at each others throats. We all blamed our experience for putting us in a bad mood.\nDo not go here. Comme Ca was so so much tastier- way better service and atmosphere. That place left us all very happy and content. Milos will hold bad memories for us."
0,"My mistake!!! I thought it was a good idea to swing by this Filiberto's and grab some Super Nachos.... something quick and easy! The whole visit wasn't quick or easy and the food was meh..... after having to wait 20 minutes in the drive through I was HANGRY!!! Who has to wait 20 minutes in a drive through for food, the point of a drive through is to get your food quick and easy! This Filiberto's definitely doesn't believe in quick.\n\nAfter becoming quite hangry I finally got my food and drove all the way home. When I got home, my food was cold! Are you kidding me!? We live in AZ no way on my drive home did my food get cold, it was already cold when they gave it to me. The meat was very dry and tasteless! Needless to say I ended up wasting 20 minutes of my time getting my food and ended up throwing it away and cooking something at home! Lets get it together Filibertos!!"
1,"Had some sushi here a couple of weeks ago and it was quite good.  It was probably the best philly roll i have ever had with a huge chunk of fish, not alot of rice, and the perfect amount of seaweed.   it wasnt cheap, but it was reasonable for the amount of fish.  True, the service is slow, but our waitess was nice.  As long as the server is nice and respectful, I do not mind slow service."
0,"Worst Hertz location experience I have ever had.  The car I reserved was not in my Gold space so I went inside.  They told me the class of car I reserved was in the space but would get me the actual car I reserved, a small SUV.  I waited 20 minutes for the right car.  While waiting the manager asked me if I was okay with a Suburban.  I said yes and he said it would cost more.  I told him I was a President's Circle member and entitled to a free upgrade.  He said no to free upgrade.\n\nUpon return there was no employee outside to check us in, although there were 3 employees standing in the return area."
1,"Best donuts I've ever had! I'm so glad they  opened a store near me because I'd have to trek to the northwest to get my donut fix! My favorite so far is the s'more donut, but everything else is pretty amazeballs. It's sooooo worth it on cheat days!"
0,"OK... While I do agree with some previous posters that Calabria is WAY better than any fast food options (and yes, Subway is fast food, people), I find a lot to be lacking at Calabria.\n\nLocated in the awesome Historic Gold Spot, I really wanted Calabria to have the charm of an Italian deli one would find in Northern New Jersey.  But, alas... It has all the charm of yet another strip mall store you find everywhere in Phoenix. \n\nYes, they do have what seem to be fresh meats and cheeses, but the sandwiches are in my opinion lackluster. I once tried one of their arancini and found it to be very similar to hush puppies like I grew up with. Fried within an inch of its life and not very tasty. \n\nHaving said that, their lasagna is tolerable. \n\nTo me, the problem with Calabria is the value for what you're paying. It's like a $10 lunch that's more of a $5 value. \n\nPlus, I hate the way they've taped over their menu sign with little strips of white paper the items they no longer carry. \n\nTacky."
1,Great place to go alone or with the family.  Great food and they make changes and fix the food the way you want without charging a lot of extra charges.  The people are always there with a smile and so friendly.  Along with the great food it is the best Mexican food restaurant in town and next to the Friday night art festival.

1,"Been here twice now.  The views are absolutely amazing.  Even if you don't want to come for dinner, it has a great patio lounge that you can come to for drinks.  Its not a bar scene, but more of a place to go and get drinks with good friends.  The food has ranged from excellent to good.  I had possibly the best lemon drop martini of my life here.  The seafood dishes are excellent.  I also ordered a brussel sprout salad which was amazing.  The steak was ok.  I've had better.  Would definitely recommend this place for a quiet dinner with good friends.  Try to get a table that faces outward.  Its really all about the view."
0,"Well I let my wife talk me into trying this \""DUMP\"" one more time. ( not my decision )  This place still \""SUCKS\"" and always will in now, both our books!!!  Thank god!!! Now, she finally See's what i was talking about this whole time. OK, she had the Roasted tri-tip and I had the country fried steak. OMG.......GROSS!!!!!   what a lump of sh**.  I'll post a pic of what I scrapped off it. ( Pic. is next to my profile pic. ) To start the waiter was da da duh....we asked for ( No lemon ) in our water and yep...you guessed it lemon. He said: i couldn't remember if you wanted lemon or not so i put it on there for you. I said: we told you 30 seconds ago, glad we are not allergic to it!!  First nose dive...Appetizer was good had the roasted artichoke ( bout the only thing they know how to make ).  Then the dreaded  so-called food came.  Waiter forgot her bread that comes with it, and no gravy poured on the tri-tip.  Mine looked like it came from a cow patty field in Jasper Oklahoma!!!  I really didn't want to even eat it.  I think a two year old could have done a better job at making it rather than them.  What makes me wonder is how this place stays in business!  No disrespect to other people but, I think they don't know what \""GOOD FOOD IS\"".  If I was the health department I would shut this place down in a heartbeat for awful tasting wanna be food.    Overall rating:  - F -F -F -F -F   five minus F's!!!!!!   ( i wish they had a food sucks rating )  To sum it up...We will NEVER step foot in there ever again!!!!     (   THANK GOD!!!!  )"
1,"I take my baby to see Dr York. Although he looks young (mid 30's?) he is an awesome doctor and knows what he's doing. I always book the first appointment of the day if possible as they do have about 6 doctors on staff so the rooms do fill up quick in the middle of the day. The one late appointment I had to make after work only resulted in a 20 min wait in the waiting room. They play childrens movies on the tv's in the waiting room and have a childrens toy for the toddlers to stand around and mess with. If you do have a medical question for the doctor you do have to leave a voice mail and they return your call within 24 hours. If I call in early enough in the morning I usually get a response that day. \n\nI highly recommend this office. \n\nParking sucks, but the office has no control over that as its on hospital grounds."
1,Great fast service....salad bar is delicious.
0,"Agree with the other negative reviews about this place. The food is overpriced, the ambience is not inviting, and the service could definitely use improvement.\n\nYou can read a more detailed review here:\nhttp://whatandydoes.blogspot.com/2009/02/sweet-o-wine-chocolate-lounge-i-do-not.html"

0,"Decided to try Rustic Cafe for lunch today.  Looked at the Yelp reviews and on line menu thinking this is a place both my wife and I would enjoy.  Sometimes I'm in the breakfast mood and she's not so things looked promising.  \n\nWe were seated quickly and received average service overall.  They certainly don't go out of their way to do anything extra.  You even have to butter your own toast (actually not butter but half melted Country Crock).  I got the feeling a great deal of the food is prepackaged.  My wife ordered the salad with smoked salmon.  The lettuce was not fresh and my wife had to pick out the pieces that were super wilted and sticking to the edible leaves.  Looked a lot like that grocery store packaged salad that's been sitting in the fridge a little too long.  The smoked salmon was maybe equal to two strips of lox.  It was torn into a few pieces and rolled up so it would look bigger...which it did compared to what was essentially a side salad.  Very disappointed for $10.  \n\nI had the Greek Skillet.  Two eggs over green peppers, \""gyro\"" meat, olives, feta, and onions.  Served with side of hash browns and toast.  First, several reviews mention the cold hash browns.  Believe it..they are served barely warm.  They are flavorless as they are simply potatoes without onions or any other flavors.  The Greek Skillet was fair.  The gyro meat is the prefab strips, not nearly as good as many fast food places serve.  \n\nNo reason to return."
0,"I had a kind of unique situation in my dealings with Mini of Las Vegas. I was driving my friend's car while she was teaching for a year in Korea. Before she left for Korea, she had the car serviced at Mini of LV and was told nothing was wrong with it other than the car needing new tires. I had the car for about six months when the check engine light came on. My friend said she thought she still had a warranty and to call the dealership. I called and spoke with Chris in Finance who advised me that there was a warranty in place and that I should get the car in as soon as possible. I dropped the car off and was told there was a diagnostic fee of almost $170. I said that there was a warranty in place and they said that the $170 would go toward the deductible. I got a call a few days later from Carlos in the Service Department advising that the repairs would cost about $3000+. I asked what would be covered by the warranty and he said there was no warranty. I told him about my conversation with the Finance Department and he said he would speak to them and call me back. There was a whole bunch of back and forth between me, Chris and Carlos. I feel like it was just a total and complete bait and switch. There is no way that I would have brought the car into the dealership had I been given the right information at the time of my initial call to Mini of LV. I didn't get the repairs done and asked them to waive the diagnostic fee because of the mix up on their part. Carlos advised me that would \""work with me\"" on the fee and reduce it to $100. When I picked the car up, I was told by the cashier that the fee was $120. Seriously? I ended up paying the $120 just to get the heck out of there. I am beyond disappointed with the false information of the finance department, the lack of communication between departments at the same location, and the lack of customer service given by all of the people I dealt with."

1,"How refreshing to dine in an establishment where the staff and owner cares so passionately about the quality and experience. We visited on a Thursday night started with the Kumamoto oysters and mix sashimi platter. The mix sashimi platter for 25$ is an amazing value, superb quality, and surprisingly voluminous assortment of yummy fish. The oysters, yellowtail, beef capriccio all 5 stars and with a delightfully pleasing presentation. The bone in short ribs - amazing!!!!!!!!!! The double dragon roll was well prepared and tasty. The green tea tiramisu was terrific.  This not an all-you-can-eat sushi joint - or a come-all sushi roll house with chicken teriyaki.  It's a high quality and adventurous sashimi house with a flare. If you have an adventurous palate, it is the place for you. The staff was overwhelming in friendliness, knowledge, and attentiveness. \n\nI forgot ..... They use real crab in their sushi rolls not the fake stuff found in 90% of the sushi houses in Las Vegas. I will be back !!!!!"
1,"Always great service. Employees are friendly, professional and funny. They are quick and always answer your questions. They take their time with their customers."
0,"YUCK! ick! ewwwww! would be how I'd describe my lunch at Sun Asian Kitchen. Whatever was served was albeit presentable but in terms of taste not good at all. I ordered the wonton soup and the Honey Chicken combo (comes with a chicken eggroll, and choice of fried rice, steamed rice or lo mein, brown rice is extra). The wonton soup had a weird taste to it, the broth was alright and the vegetables included in the soup canned. The Honey Chicken combo arrived shortly after, and it looked promising. And what goodness it seemed to offer ended after the first bite. I know how to cook fried rice, and yes, fried rice is made with day old rice but what I had was the rice at the bottom of the pan, there were hard bits to it that would stick to my teeth and there was no flavor to it, as for flavor, the honey chicken had nothing close to it being honey chicken, and the dish tasted off. It was a mess. I was hoping to at least enjoy the chicken minus the lackluster fried rice but the fried pieces of chicken was mostly batter and less chicken. And the sauce was just too sweet and thick that I really didn't know what I was eating hence I just stopped eating and considered my lunch a loss. =( I agree with a yelper that sun asian kitchen is a step above fast food but if I were to compare this tragedy with Panda Express, I'd take Panda over this hot mess. Overall my experience at Sun Asian Kitchen was bad sauce, and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone at all. I'm sorry Sun Asian Kitchen, you're a bad news bear. =("
1,"This is one of the reasons why I visit Phoenix! I have at least stop by here to eat once at every visit. That's how amazing this place is! The environment here really reminds me of people from the south east coast and so do the people. They have that attitude and personality which is really interesting and cool for me to see since I've mostly all my life with on the west coast. So to see a change of personality of someone who is from the other side of the country is a thrill. To start off your drinks are brought to you in a jar which really keeps to the south eastern style and I ordered myself some good ol koolaid which I haven't drank since I was a kid! Then I ordered a 2 piece chicken piece fried Louisiana style with waffles and a side of fried catfish. They taste BOMB! The chicken is still juicy and not all dried out along with a little kick of spice and mixing that with the waffle and syrup is just a great combo. I know to some western people that sounds weird and funny but until you try it, you can't really judge lol. The fried catfish was also amazing. It really hit the spot and during the whole time I can't even socialize with my friends since I'm too busy digging into this delicious meal!!"
0,"This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. \n\nI bought a Groupon for $78 and thought I was getting a fabulous deal! The photo looked like maybe they cleaned the place up a bit and the extras were cool ($20 slot play, 2 free welcome drinks, 2 tickets to the comedy show) so I bought it. \n\nI got into town on Sunday at 4pm and was originally given a room at the North Tower. Ummm...Wet spot on the carpet (I didn't know if it was a blood stain, piss or just a spill or maybe a pitcher of beer), pubic hair plastered on the back of the bathroom door and the stench. WOW! For it not being a non-smokers room, it sure the hell smelled like a dingy old bar!! When I attempted to take a shower, the shower water didn't go down. Basically I was up to my ankles in Vegas sweat and the black sediment starting coming up from the drain. \n\nI complained and was told that they would give me a new room. Downstairs I go at 1am to collect a new key. I was then told I would be staying in a totally different tower. OK - Here I go....\n\n15-minutes into my stay in my 2nd room I spot something crawling up the wall. Ummm...yeah, a baby cockroach. I killed it and called the front desk. After a 7-minute hold time I decided to walk myself, my daughter and the dead bug down to speak with management one-on-one. I showed the kid behind the counter my findings and I said \""If there's one, there's more\"". His response \""not necessarily\"". WHAT? Are you kidding me?! I was then directed to the manager where I told her the problem and she gave me a different room. No apology, no comped drink (s), no breakfast...Nothing. Come on now, at least an apology!! So we were given another room where we slept uneasy. I checked out as early as I could the next day. I couldn't wait to get the hell out of there. \n\nI will never go back to that dump again. I'd rather sleep in my car."
0,"It's sad.   I have been visiting this location for four years.  Always appreciated the positive customer service and overall quality of work.  This quality has quickly declined over the past few months.  I have had poor washes and dealt mostly with unfriendly staff.  My most recent visit was a nightmare.  Poor customer service and they kept my house keys!!!!!!!!\n\nI went to the carwash because my battery had died mid-day.  I had purchased my last battery through Danny's and was hoping to take advantage of their warranty.  Unfortunately, my warranty was expired by a month and the informed me that there was nothing they could do about that.  I said fine and proceeded to get an oil change and a new battery.  After about 30 minutes they told me that the oil change was completed but that they did not have the battery in stock.  I asked them to please make sure staff knew not to turn the car off so I would not need a jump before leaving.  They did not relay this message to the car wash.  After having my car washed, an employee came over to tell me I was having battery trouble and that they could not start the car.  I informed the man that the battery trouble was my original reason for coming.  After waiting again for the service department to come over and jump my car again, I left to purchase a battery elsewhere (O'Reilly's, great prices and a great three year warranty btw)\n\nWhen I arrived at O'Reilly's i realized that they had only returned the fab for my car and NOT the keys that were attached to the fab.  I called Danny's to state I would be coming back for my keys.  They assured me that they had given me the keys and told me the service department was closed so I could not come back for the keys anyway. . .SOOOOO how am I supposed to get into my house Danny's if you have my house keys???  Luckily a friend had an extra set.\n\nI called first thing in the morning Friday.  Was assured they did not have my keys and that a manager would call me.  No call back Friday.\n\nI called this morning (Saturday) and spoke with a manager.  He assured me that he had my keys and that I could pick them up at any time.  I said, I tried to pick the keys up twice at this point and felt that it was their responsibility to return them to me.  After about 10 minutes of speaking with the manager, he assured me that the keys would be dropped off at my condo complex by 5.\n\nNO KEYS.  4 days later. . .NO HOUSE KEYS???  What gives Danny's????"
1,"I loved the homemade pasta, but I guess that wasn't enough. They're not in business any longer."
0,"Good tasting food, but way over priced.  If you would like to go for the experience, feel free.  But if it's because you are hungry, you'd do better to just grab something from Popeyes or KFC."
0,This buffet is so so. Certainly not as enticing as the other ones on The Strip.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had tried all of the most popular buffets and some not so popular buffets on The Strip. The buffet at Mirage was pretty small and did not have many tasty items. Presentation of the food was just as bland as the food. I only remember the chow mein was good but it was probably the MSG or added sodium. The prime rib was anything but tender and very much overcooked.\n\nOur server however was very kind but I wouldn't come back.
1,Reminds me of Alice in Wonderland in here! Super cute. Good food. Can't remember what I liked best. I'd recommend getting a plate full of desserts for everyone and sharing it because they're not that good... They're super cute though! Could NOT bite into the candle apple. Thought I was going to break a tooth or something
0,This place is nothing great than a regular bakery you find at the end of every street in america.\nThey have very limited selection of pastries and they tasted mediocre.\nThe cup cakes werent perfectly iced and they were sliding . Not a big fan of their work.overpriced and over hyped
0,"Food poison~  Watch out.  \nThis used to be my favorite place when visiting Vegas.  However, the service has gone far and beyond down to be unbearable.  Til about one year or two years ago, uni was still AYCE.  So, they changed to 2 orders, 4 pieces per person.  That's all right.  I started to read into the menu once warned by the chef when I placed my second order of my uni.  I mean, he literally had to be rude enough to say \""This is your last order, ok?\""  I mean, I didn't know, all right?  It was the smallest print on the very bottom of the menu.  If you want customers to know, advertise it large enough so that before I placed AYCE order, I know my limitations, and I can leave without being baited by your trick.  Ok, then, I noticed the oysters also have the limit that per person, they allow you to have 12 oysters each.  We have party of two, so we should be allowed 24 oysters.  The first order -4 pieces.  The second order 6 pieces.  Then, third order, 6 pieces.  So, do the math, we still have 8 pieces to go.  Then, come the time we were ordering the last 8 pieces, the chef who has been neglecting us the whole time (he was so busy watching the baseball games on TV and attended to some Caucasian customers), shouted, \""I think you only have 6 pieces left.\""  Then, he went ahead and gave the 6 pieces to us.  WTF.  If you don't want people to order things from your menu, don't offer them.  Disclose this and lock your food up in the closet.  Then, I can easily walk away to get something else that's far better than what you have.   Two chef, throughout the time NEVER EVER asked us what we would like.  We had to call them a few times to catch their attention.  The guy who looked Filipino was especially rude and lacking the chef skill.  Apparently, he is a new chef and perhaps that's why he couldn't even give us any sashimi dishes that weren't messed up.  The just wasn't cut right and all the pieces were still connected when he served sashimi to us.  One plate, he was about to give to me, he pulled it back from my hand and yelled, \""I forgot the sauce.\""  Who cares if there is no sauce?  Just give to me the sauce.  You don't give the customers the plates and then pulled them back from customers' hands, ok?  On top of countless rude behavior they had, after I left, I had food poison from the sushi the whole night and couldn't help thinking, \""Thank goodness that they limit the amount you can order of oyster and uni\"", or, the poison would be even more serious....What a nightmare.   Really, do yourself a favor by going elsewhere..."
1,Another good meal ... this time the Housemade Meatloaf. It's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. A refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. Served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. The server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. Service was prompt just the same. Overall good experience.
1,5 stars for sure. I called them based on the reviews on yelp. The owner came out and was very professional and knowledgeable.  This will be my go-to company for any repairs needed in the future.  A friend asked for an A/C repair company a few days later and guess who I suggested!

1,"I've been coming to Pin Kaow for a little over a year and I'll tell you it is more like PIN WOW. I don't think I can say it is the most authentic Thai restaurant in the game but I can definitely say it's my personal favorite. I've been here numerous times over the past year or so and I can't stop coming back. My girlfriend and I have always gone to this place and left completely and fully satisfied.\n\nFirst of all, the services from the staff is great. They have always been more than accommodating and attentive to the point where I feel like I'm being pampered. You never have to ask for a water refill, it's done before you can think otherwise. I've been there at varying hours of the day and I have never not been seated within 5-10 minutes at the most. Brilliant service, by people who seem like they actually enjoy being there. \n\nThe food, ahh the food. The most important part of every restaurant, depending on whether or not you're that person that judges places off of the bathroom. I guess, in that case, this place is also pretty delightful. Anyway, my girlfriend and I usually get the same thing so this is my opinion on what we always get. To drink, it's either a a nice cold Chang Beer or the Thai Milk Tea. Both delicious and both delicious. I think I said delicious twice *smugface*\n\nWe always order the Chicken Pad Thai, which is probably a stereotypical order at a Thai restaurant but trust me it's delicious. The pad thai is always accompanied by Black Bean Shrimp and the Mongolian Beef. You can choose your spicy level, from 1-10 I believe. I'm extra adventurous and cap out at spice number 5 and it's always just the right amount of spicy. All the entree's come with a side of rice, for you rice fanatics.\n\nThe food is decently priced and I've never felt as if I'm stretching my wallet for dinner or lunch. All of that in mind, this is one of my favorite joints in the city. I'd recommend this place to anyone, unless you're a traditional Thai person. Because I have a Thai friend and the only place you can get \""real\"" Thai food is \""at my house.\"" I've never been invited though, so until that fantasy happens I will continue being a proud and faithful Pin Kaow-er."
1,"Had an excellent birthday dinner with the family on Saturday here at Triple George!  I ordered the grilled swordfish special, served on wild rice with glazed snap peas and it was amazing--tasty, moist and flaky!  The only \""complaint\"" is that they did not have a spicy vodka like Peppar and the clam chowder tasted too \""smoky\"".  Otherwise, loved the service, loved the atmosphere and loved that it is Downtown!"
0,"(originally posted this in late SEPT ... I checked back recently, and inexplicably found my review missing?!?!  What happened here, Yelp, did someone from teh show contact you and ask to remove my and my coworkers negative review?!?!?!)\n\nSpamalot in Vegas was miserable, just miserable :(\n\nSome background on me - big MP fan, love the Holy Grail movie, and for the most part I really enjoy broadway-type musicals (e.g., just saw Avenue Q in SF, it was hilarous & awesome!).\n\nI've been wanting to see Spamalot on Broadway ever since I heard about it last year ... from what I'd heard, the show was very well received in NY and was hilarious.  So when I found out it was playing in Vegas, I was stoked ... my only fear was whether or not the show had been \""vegasized,\"" but after reading the reviews on Yelp! that fear was allayed.\n\nWell, future yelpers reading this beware - this show is _terrible_, just absolutely bad ... and doubly so if you buy the tix at $100+ face value as we did :(\n\nI gotta think that the original production was nothing like the Vegas show (that much \""kitzsh\"" and predictible, bad jokes could never have gone over well, could it?!?!), and that they mukked with the show to make it more palatable to typical 50+ Vegas showgoers ... that's the only thing I can think (said crowd, btw, gave this show an inexplicable standing ovation ... unreal).\n\nShow had only two saving graces, imho - the \""lady of the lake\"" actress had a great voice, and some relatively funny lines; and the \""jews on broadway\"" number was mildly amusing.\n\nAnyway, strongly advise against this for MP and Holy Grail fans, and probably anyone else under 45.  OTOH, if you enjoy Vegas glitz and glam paired with obvious & predictable jokes, perhaps you'll enjoy this show as well."
0,"Caution: do not go here! I just got back from eating here for the first time. All I can say is this food and service was awkward and disappointing. We walk in, no music and the ambiance was boring. The coffee is watered down and they do not carry Splenda- which I can overlook. My omelette was mediocre. It was supposed to have grilled onions and mushrooms inside but instead looked like they were just placed inside. There was very little flavor and I'm sure the mushrooms were canned. My boyfriend got the Benedict- which immediately looked like the hollandaise sauce was packaged. Overall please go spend your money elsewhere.... Down the street to Crackers And Co- much better service, food, coffee and ambiance! \n\nThanks for reading"
0,"First, I walk in and say \""I have an appointment.\"" The guy says \""I don't know what that means.\"" Really? Then this other guy comes out takes my keys and says it will be 45 minutes for the four wheel alignment. Fine. So I go across the street for a lunch. 50 minutes pass so I walk back to the car place. The guy sees me coming, quickly moves another car off the.ramp and then moves mine up to work on it. I ask him, \""Seriously!! You haven't started it yet??!!?\"" He says the other car was here first and its been here all day on the ramp. Except when I dropped off my car the ramp was empty. So fifteen minutes after I came back the car is done. Then I had to take it somewhere else to have the alignment checked again because I didn't trust the guy. Basically this place was more hassle then its worth and the guy was a liar which just isn't a good thing for a mechanic. I will say, that I ended up getting a call later from the manager, and he said he would look into it. Hopefully they're getting their act together, and they fired that guy. If you do go here, just make sure you keep good tract of what's going on."
1,"I love hot dogs. There, I said it. I always feel like less of a foodie whenever I have one, but I don't care. Hot dogs, FTW. \n\nThe hot dogs at JJ's are hot dogs unlike any I've ever had. The dog itself is whatever. It's a hot dog. But the toppings, and more importantly the combination of toppings is what takes these to the next level. \n\nGraham was traditional and boring with his dog. He had the Char-heel, which was a combination of slaw, chili, raw onions and mustard. I loathe all of those toppings, so I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. But in his words it was \""effing delicious\"". \n\nI had the dog of the week (the big cheesy), and oh baby... It was topped with bacon, jalepeno pimento cheese & pickled jalepeno. One word to describe it: epic. The pimento cheese was so good. It's not a combination I would have ever put together on my own, but it definitely worked! \n\nWe both had our dogs with chili cheese fries (which were fantastic) and best of all, it was SO CHEAP! $15 for everything, including two sodas."

1,"I actually had my wedding dinner here after our ceremony. It was an unusual choice but i wanted something casual and near our hotel. This seems liked the place. They had a catering menu we ordered off, it wasn't cheap, but they provided enough food for everyone and everything for the most part was decent. I would say it was a couple steps up from bar food. The best thing was they made our wedding cake, which was $75, cute, feed all 20 of us and was delicious!!!! (red velvet with cream cheese frosting)\nI probably wouldnt come here again next time were in Vegas just due to all the different places to try, but if you want an upscale bar with food, you should check them out."
0,"Horrible service. Walked in and never got greeting or even a smile from the employees. There was 3 people ahead of me and I waited patiently to be helped. As cece asked \""what do you want\"" I told her and it took her 5 minutes to cut the 3 pieces of meat and cheese. She was so slow the other worker had people waiting to pay while she helped cut meat much more efficiently. I left without a sub because it took another 10 minutes for them to ask what I wanted on the sub."
1,The Pizza was great and the the pick up service was polite.  I look forward to going back there many times in the future.
1,"My family has been here about dozen times in the last few years. My kids love the chicken and broccoli here. The staff is super nice. We've always had good service here. Food is generally pretty good, although sometimes a bit greasy (which is why I left off a star). Prices are very reasonable too."
1,Good cheeseburgers and nice draft selection. Lots of huge flat screens. Nice location near the Doubletree.
0,"I used a groupon and still felt like they should have paid me to ingest this greasy, canned, smelly, revolting garbage.  \n\nIt astounding that this dump is still open.  It's gotta be a nostalgia thing with people who have fond memories of this bastion of canned and frozen cuisine from their younger years.  The clientele appeared to be, uh, rather obes.  So maybe it's the massive portions of high carb/fat that keeps these heifers coming through the door to graze?  A BMI that high does not come without putting in some effort!\n\nThe \""meat\"" in my dish was some greasy lips and assholes.  I tried to get by the visual and get a forkful into my mouth.  Needless to say, this was a mistake.  \n\nAnd to finish up this Tour de Food Lion, the owner at checkout was a rude.  When my friend and I tried to split the bill with two credit cards he said \""Oh come on.  You are killing me!\"".  My response was \""Yeah, the feces on a plate that you call food is killing me!\"".  He did not appreciate that.  Not at all.  And I could not have given less of a shit!"
1,"Finally tried their veggie wings, and wow! It was excellent! It's definitely worth trying if you're not eating meat! I actually love this location compared to the other one....the only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the effen server had a slight attitude...well I actually pulled the manager aside to make sure that I was really eating veggie wings and not real chicken because it was deelish and couldn't believe it was soy meat. I guess our server saw us chatting it up w the manager and decided to confront us! ....wrong thing to do so that deserved a star deduction...anyway overall a good location. Even though we had n attitude issue w this specific server, it's still a better yard house than the one at red rock."

The collard greens were too strangely sweet.  The cobbler tasted like they used bacon grease for the paste they call a crust. \n\nI may go again for the meat but I will pass on the sides."
1,I saw Dr. Johnson for neck and shoulder pain while I was traveling. He was very thorough in his assessment and treatment. I had ART and adjustments in the office and then he gave me exercises for home. I felt much improved immediately and it was great to have the exercises for self care at home. Highly recommend

1,"I believe I've found my new favorite restaurant. After being rather dissapointed with Chaya last night, I decided to go to Umi tonight.\n\nThe staff was friendly and service perfect. There servers watch for you to dictate the pace of the meal.\n\nBeggining with the typical salad with ginger dressing: I was very happy with this dressing, just about perfect.\n\nNext the miso soup: I'm not generally a huge fan of miso soup, but this was probably the best preparation I've had. I could have gone for another bowl. \n\nFor my entree I chose the dinner sushi assortment. This was by far the best sushi I've ever tasted. As cliche as it may sound, every piece (including fin which is notoriously tough) was melt in your mouth good.  The accompanying sauces are not overbearing in the least, they merely enhance the flavor of the fish.  The pieces of nigiri themselves are bite size - as in 1 bite without looking like you're stuffing your mouth.  This is smaller than the giant balls of rice with large cuts of fish you often times see at other places. I rather enjoyed the size, but just wanted to make note of it. The tuna roll was also very tasty. I did not sample any other rolls tonight, but I'm sure I will be back to do so.\n\nMy dining companion had the chicken teriyaki.  The dish came out sizzeling from the back kitchen.  Again, this was probably the best preperation of the dish I've ever tasted. The serving size was perfect, about 5oz of very tender breast meat, with accompanying vegetables and a small side of rice.  More than enough to satiate, without the need for a nap afterwards. \n\nI didn't sample the desserts tonight, but I've seen others rave about them. I will definitely be back, as often as I can. I don't really care to try sushi anywhere else in Pittsburgh."
1,"For a fun night out w the girls American storm is it fri night 10 pm sat night 1130 pm the guys are fun upbeat,playful  they come and drink with you after the shows...... Lots of fun"
0,"It's what you'd expect from a sushi restaurant that is in one of the nicer hotels on the strip.  The quality of the fish was good and the rolls were above average.  The difficulty I found was that the meal wasn't very memorable.  Although the roll selection was very unique, nothing stood out as a 'Wow, I'll remember this roll forever' type of experience.  \n\nFor the price, it wasn't as good as it should have been.\n\nAdditionally, the service was lackluster.  The sushi came out super fast after we ordered, which is troubling considering it took 10 minutes just for the waiter to take our drink orders and then another 15 before the manager realized our order hadn't been taken yet.\n\nOverall a decent meal that was expensive and not very memorable."
1,"The steak. Indescribable. Absolutely perfect. Get the mushrooms too. Good wine, great service. Cucumber mojito is smooth too."
1,"I have been to Salsa Blance about six times and have been pleasently surprised.  The quesadillas, tamales, chicken tacos and fish tacos are great!  Another surprise was the seafood enchiladas...very good!  Wasn't real impressed with the red chile.  Overall very very good!"
0,"This apartment complex started out quite nice and quiet. It had a lot of military and families. Then it seemed to turn into college dorms. All day long we hear loud thumping, banging, screaming, and running around. At night our neighbors don't seem to care that others are sleeping and are as loud as the want. I'll hear them all the way up until 2:00 in the morning. Management is nice but that's the problem. They are too nice and too lenient. We have a ton of punk kids who vandalize the property. The other day for about an hour around 8:00 at night somebody decided it would be fun to drive around our building blaring their horn. Really? That's what you do with your life? Then today the fire alarm (which could burst a eardrum) went off for no reason. No doubt another punk kid who thinks they are cool. The only reason I'm still here is because my fianc\u00e9 and I are looking for a house, but we can't move soon enough. And no it's not me. We lived in another apartment complex for two years without any one of these problems. We have only been here for a year and have already gotten somebody evicted. But only after countless parties, me being followed, cops being called for domestic violence, and my property being stolen. Also the rent here is ridiculous and completely not worth it. For what we are paying we could have rented a house and not have had to deal with these problems. Basically, keep looking. There are much better apartments out there."
1,"Let me start by saying that I didn't really like this place at all the first time I went. It was divey and I couldn't get passed the salsa. My wife is a big fan and would make me go and I just didn't dig it. Oh but how things change as Juan's grew on me. Since I first started going 2 or 3 years ago it has undergone a renovation and is a bit more appealing now than it used to be. \n\nFrom torta's to tamales to cheecrisps I've never had anything I didn't like. The food is solid, the prices are great. I can't think of any place in central Phoenix that's as clean and friendly with prices as low. I love the rice, the beans are okay too. The only thing I don't like is the salsa which I can get over for the quality of everything else and the price. Even my kids love the \""little Juan's\"" menu, they always get the cheese enchilada and love it. Not too spicy and pretty darn good.  Juan's is a jewel of central Phoenix and after a little convincing I'm glad I found it.\n\nCons:\nI don't like the salsa\nNot open on Sundays\n\nPros:\nFriendly and speedy service\nGreat prices\nGood size menu\nBeer\nYou can watch them make the food"
0,We waited in line for 2 hours to eat at this buffett and we're very disappointed. When you wait in line for 2 hours you expect the food to be worth the wait but that was not the case. The crab legs were sitting on ice and some of them still frozen. I don't know about everyone else but I prefer hot or at least warm crab legs. The sushi was terrible. The fish inside the rolls was good but the rice was tough and chewy. Both the clams and the mussels had a lot of sand and pieces of shell... very crunchy.  The rest of the food they had to offer was good but by no means great and definitely not worth the wait to get in. The crepes would have been realy good if the fruit they put inside them wasn't still frozen : ( We also had to ask for refills on our waters and then wait about 5 minutes for them. Not worth half the money or the wait.
1,"I've been here five times for breakfast now, and Sally has yet to disappoint.  The lunch / dinner menu is all comfort, but looks solid as well.  Nice little stage setup by the bar for acoustic sets they host during the weekends.  I'm a fan!"
1,"This is a good BBQ place that serves a good brisket.   I usually go for sausage and brisket while my husband is the rib eater.  I grew up in Texas and ribs must fall off the bone, so I do not find too many places here in town that meet that criteria, so I usually will try his.\n\nThis place also has a unique item for appetizers, fried pickles, if you haven't tried them before, they're not bad.  Overall, the meats had a good smokey flavor, the ribs were tender, but just not Texas perfect, but close. The sides of cole slaw and collard greens were also very good.\n\nI recommend this place, overall, not a bad BBQ."
1,"To say this place is super rad would be an understatement!!  We for las noches de las luminarias.  And I wish we could've stayed longer, also seeing the gardens during the daylight is added to the 'to do' list!  \n\nHaving never been there the staff was super helpful in guiding us, not to mention really friendly!  The music was entertaining and a good variety.  They also have a synthetic ice rink and you're allowed up to 15 minutes of skating, if you're not shy!  The buffet they offered was a joke and I don't recommend doing it.  For 16.50, you're only allowed one trip through and other such silly stipulations... no thanks.   \n\nOther than that, what a great place to go!"

0,"I've been to Keegan's a few times, and I would like to give this 2 1/2 stars bc  it is exactly a middle of the road kind of place. The food was fine, atmosphere normal, drinks were drinks. Nothing stood out to me, but there was also nothiing wrong. I wouldn't suggest it if friends were getting together, but if someone else wanted to go, I wouldn't mind. (but I wouldn't get the nachos)"
0,"This place is run by a bunch of incompetent retards. I NEVER get what I order, I always have to have them remake it. They are extremely disorganized. It takes forever to place your order because they are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  I only come here because of the location."
0,"Compared to other Hotels such as the Cosmopolitan in the area, this hotel rates poorly on all the following:\n\n+ Rooms: Dirty, old and dark - food found under the bed and toiletries remaining from the previous guest were found in the shower. Leading us to believe that the only thing that had been cleaned were the beds (or so we hoped). When addressing this with the staff they did nothing\n+Convenience: You will be charged a $200 room deposit that will take 5 - 7 business days to return. The Cosmopolitan is $150 and the funds are released immediately upon checkout. \n+Late Check Out: The latest you can check out is 12 pm, at the Cosmopolitan check out is 2 pm \n+Service: Staff will prioritize conversation among themselves vs. checking in guests. Check-in took 20 minutes with no one in line before us.\n\nWe were just there over labor day weekend and the hotel was slow compared to other hotels in the area. If you are looking for good guest service, nice rooms, and the convenience of a late check out given that you are in Vegas, do not book at Caesar's palace."
1,"This is my favorite place to eat in Arizona and I'm a native. I've been here almost 32 years and I just love coming here.\n\nI came here once with my wife and then several months later with some coworkers. I had the same waiter (great guy with the pony tail) and he remembered what my wife had ordered months back. I couldn't believe it. \n\nThe bar is top notch. They make the best Manhattan in the valley.\n\nThis is real Italian food folks. Of course there are some negative reviews because well, some people just like The Olive Garden. You can't please everyone. If you like going to The Olive Garden, this place isn't for you. If you like to feel like you just discovered a gem in Sicily for the first time, definitely come to Tomaso's.\n\nIt's nice enough to celebrate Valentine's Day or an Anniversary here, but also cool enough to go with a group of guys to get some drinks and eat for a few hours ... Yes, you can literally spend hours here eating and drinking. They always make you feel like family. \n\nJason"
0,"I'm always a little leery about going to Sports restaurants.  They usually lack character and the food is never impressive.  I reaffirmed this belief with my visit to Majerle's.  I ordered the soft chicken tacos, which was listed under the \""Entrees and Sandwiches\"" category.  It said all entrees and sandwiches come with fries.  I was greatly looking forward to this, because my tacos were to also include chips and salsa (which I hate).  I never did receive fries with my meal.  I know tacos and fries don't normally go together, but the menu made me believe they did.  I asked the waitress why I didn't receive any fries and she replied, \""because I ordered the tacos\"".  No where on the menu did it say \""Tacos do not come with fries, even though it says entrees receive fries\"". It may seem like I am over-reacting about some fries, but the tacos I received were tiny and unfilling and I did not touch the chips.  Chips and salsa should be free, not part of a meal! The waitress was very unsympathetic about my issue.  When I asked her how much it would be to get a side of fries,  she insisted on showing me the price on the menu instead of just telling me, like I should have searched the menu better. The waitress never came by once to fill my cup of water, but was eager to get everyone else another beer. I sat there with an empty cup the majority of the meal. The servers in general were not very friendly. One last complaint, the chicken in the tacos were supposedly marinated in a sauce but the chicken was rather dry and bland.  I did not taste any seasoning what-so-ever. So in the end, I got 3 tiny tacos for $9...plus tip and tax. Yaaaaay I love wasting money.  Never going here again."
1,I was there this past Saturday 7/26/14 and had a wonderful time. Dj played mostly hip hop music.
1,I had the pasta weesie and my husband had like a sample platter of chicken dishes both of the dishes were good and we had a really nice waitress Christianne H. We also had the spicy lentil soup at the recommendation of our waitress. I would come back again and I would recommend it as a good date night or just because night out.
0,"This place is a dump! The girls are long past their prime and some never has a prime. I mean you actually want to give some of the girls  $$ to keep their tops ON.\n\nSo when you drive by and see the sign at the corner of Spring Mountain and Wynn, KEEP DRIVING- do not stop unless you really, really want to waste your time and money."
1,"My husband and I are big fans of breakfast fare and we've become regulars at The Good Egg for consistent delicious fixes.\n\nThey have an extensive menu that provides more healthy options (that actually taste good) than most breakfast restaurants offer.\n\nThe service and food isn't always stellar, which is why I give it 4 stars rather than 5, but both are usually excellent and I have never left completely disappointed."
1,"let me start the review by saying if you haven't been here while staying at the venetian, you REALLY messed up. The ambiance is pretty relaxed compared to any other restaurant on the strip. Came here with co-workers for a bite to eat after one of those vegas nights. Ordered spicy ginger beef and it was AMAZING. Came with veggies and choice of rice. Very well seasoned and not too much soy. Veggies balance out the amount of salt. I tried some of the chicken and waffles, while sober keep in mind, and it was literally the best chicken and waffles experience of my life. I had the same dish at founding farmers in Washington D.C. and was pretty disappointed. The bread is also warm and served with a huge square of butter, im talking quarter of the whole stick huge. Server was very attentive and kept the table updated when the food took a little long to come out. Refilled water multiple times and made sure we got all the bread we can eat.  Great place, wish all the cheesecake factories had this menu, then again theres only one Vegas!"
0,"i recently went on thai food kick around town... and to make the comparison fair decided to have basil chicken in several places... Thara Thai, Nitaya Thai and Basil Thai in campustown. the latter (Basil Thai) is by far the worst. as one reviewer already wrote before me, this is made here with ground chicken which is tasteless, too little food, and covered in a litre of sauce/broth. WTF? the tables and chairs in this place also seem sticky... covered in some weird nasty film. in summary, two words: stay away."
1,"I hit up the Mad Onion on the tip that there was $10.99 Prime Rib dinner.\n\nThe short of it was that the food was good (not great), and the service was good. There's really not a whole lot to complain about. At the $10.99 price level, you are certainly getting value.\n\nDisclaimer: I don't really know quality of prime ribs dinner.\n\nAll I can say was the prime rib dinner was pretty good. The portion size wasn't super large, but it was good size. I think it is a reasonable sized portion for someone who has an average appetite. I was able to finish the prime rib, the baked potato side, and most of the veggies. I don't like carrots or green beans so I usually don't eat those.\n\nI would give Mad Onion 4 stars. The food was okay/good, but I didn't feel like it was amazing. The service is kind of standard. The waiters were receptive, but I didn't feel like they were amazing or anything. I try to keep my expectations REASONABLE when rating the Mad Onion. All and all a good experience. I left full and in good spirits. More importantly, my wallet wasn't hurting. Solid four star experience given the circumstances (price, location, food)."
0,"Meh. I already am kinda opposed to the Yardhouse since it's a chain and all, but a group planned to watch a football game  here, so I decided to stop by with the fam. \nFood is ok. Here we had the artichoke (2 stars), homemade potato chips (3 stars, which is good cuz I usually don't like those things), and wings (3.5 stars). \nBeer selection is very good, if a little predictable. \nAtmosphere is cool. It's in the Linq. We had 3 tvs devoted to our football game, which was definitely not a top 25 matchup. \nService sucks. Slow. Never checked in for refills/new beers. Literally scowled at our 3 year old for standing within 2 feet of the servers bar. Honestly, I would excuse all this if they were busy, but the whole place was only about 1/3 full! You're professional servers on Las Vegas Blvd! Get it together!\nDid I mention prices are a lil high (avg for the Linq)? Overall, I'll avoid this place."
0,"I have always loved Hungry Howies Pizza, preferrably with a garlic crust. It has been one of my favorite fast food pizza places to order from for years now. The last two times that I have ordered from them has been nothing short of a horrible experience. The first of the last two times, I ordered a pizza and it arrived after 1.5 hours of waiting. Of course the standard is 45 minutes which I expected but I had to call at 1.5 hours to see where my pizza was, they said he was almost to my house. When the pizza arrived it was cold. It wasn't even luke warm. So I had to heat my oven to cook it  a bit longer so it was at a temperature that was edible. I called to complain to the company and all they said was sorry. They didn't offer any compensation or even a coupon for my next visit. The most recent experience was not pleasant either. I ordered a pizza and it arrived within the 45 minutes this time, however, instead of giving me my standard cheese pizza with garlic crust and ranch order... they brought me a thin crust cheese pizza and no ranch. So I drove my butt down to the pizza restaurant after calling them to complain. They replaced my pizza. They again did not bother with any compensation or even a coupon. They didn't even apologize this time. I have been a hungry howies customer for years now and after this service, I refuse to spend any more of my money or time on this business. I will be ordering from anywhere but this restaurant. I am a pizza lover and literally eat it once a week and service where they do not care about their customers is no business I wish to support."
1,"I liked it, my daughter didn't. I chose the grilled chicken sandwich, she went with the fried chicken sandwich. Chicken tenders (grilled or fried) on a bun with a splot of Hubee D's sauce and pickle slices. Everything is made to order so it does take a few minutes if it's busy.\n\nFries? Excellent and fresh, the right salt. Cole slaw? Good and creamy. Cornbread muffin? Firm and tasty, very good. As for the sandwich, it was quite tasty and I'd absolutely have it again. The chicken was moist and there was enough of it. Several table sauces to choose from if you want to add. The Buffalo was too hot for me but the Hubee D's was perfect.\n\nService was good, though maybe too much. Each time one of the several folks passed by, they were asking if we needed anything. At least five times in fifteen minutes. They could use a \""do not disturb\"" sign on the table.\n\nHubee D's has a big challenge competing in Rivergate with the Chick-Fil-A and McDonald's right nearby. For fast casual, there's also a pizza place, a sub place and Salsarita's. And more upscale includes Friday's and Buffalo Wild Wings. Good luck, folks."
1,"I fell in love with Mexican tacos all over again.  \n\nHappy Hour 4:30-6:30 = half price tacos.  Awesome, nay, amazing Tacos. \nI lived in Mexico for 6 months.  I've had my fair share(OK, fine, more than my fair share) of Mexican street cart tacos.  I have a special place in my heart for Tacos & Beer in Acapulco.  RCT is up there on my list of favorite taco joints.\n\nRCT serves Mexican-American style tacos.  What that means, is they're served Mexico-style, but with an American, upscale twist.  For example...we had pork belly, carne asada, pollo, & pastor.  They're serve on two corn tortillas, ~50% larger than Mexico.  Then they're blasted with queso, radish slices, & cilantro.  Ranking in order were pork belly (far & away the best), pastor, carne asada, & pollo.  I'd pass on pollo next time..not bad, but generic.  The pastor is not \""authentic\"" but it's still damned good.  I've given up on finding real pastor in the states.  Theirs is tender & soaked in adobo sauce, and absolutely worth getting.*\n\nOn a later visit, I tried a Tijuana Street dog.  These things are like drugs in Mexico (widely available, addictive, & easy to find at 5am.)  It's a grilled hot dog wrapped in bacon, covered in avocado, pico, crema, jalapenos, & cheese.  If you think it sounds too intense...you sir, or ma'am, are not a friend of mine.  It wasn't quite the same, but it still brought back memories.  \n\nOh yeah, they have lots of drinks here, too.  :)\n\n*(If you go to Mexico, the one thing you MUST try is real pastor; if it's not on a spit, it doesn't have a pineapple at the top, and there isn't a Mexican guy putting a Japanese guy to shame with his knife skills...move along to the next joint..)"
0,"This Macy's is terrible.  This may sound ridiculous but it's worth driving across town to go to the one is Scottsdale.  The selection here is horrible, the staff are unhelpful and everything always seems to be out of stock."
0,"I love mongolian bbq. It's a simple process which is what I really enjoy most about it. But I don't get this place. Their process is super complicated. There are different sizes with different prices, and if you get more than one serving then you pay extra. We were all confused. Even our friends that have gone there before, were confused.You fill out a card, then hand it over once you've gathered all of your ingredients. You hand over your card and sit down. Then they bring your food to you. I feel this removes the whole mongolian bbq experience of watching them cook your food right in front of you. That's one of the reasons that attracts people to mongolian bbq, and they completely got rid of it. And they had super small containers for all the ingredients, which they had to keep refilling. Their whole process just seemed extremely inefficient. And they had have way too many people to work due to this inefficient process. It just doesn't make any sense to me. Granted the food was good and they had different flavored sauces and seasonings, but I don't think I'll be returning."
1,"Three mother-effing listings for the same place...really people....\n\nAlright came with a group of friends and fellow yelpers for the legendary ShowFlake Shaved Ice. Honestly i didnt really want to come here. I wanted to hit up Perfect Scoop instead as they have amazing home made ice cream and the flavored teas are friggin awesome. \n\nWhy did i not care for shaved ice? Well another shaved ice place on Spring Mountain closer to the i15 which upon grand opening spreaded A LOT of hype about how super awesome shaved ice was, how superior to ice cream or shaved ice is, and how it'll cure ACNE and enlarge your penis by 16% per serving. Overall i found them over priced, unbalanced, and nothing really that spectacular. \n\nEnter SnowFlake Shavery\nSo i ordered the Mucho Mango. Mango is a fragrant fruit. Unless most of the flavor is coming from an artificial source it's not easy to completely screw up anything mango flavored especially when it comes with chunks of fresh mango. I did modify it a bit by getting the strawberry sauce which turned out to be strawberry infused condensed milk instead of regular milk flavored condensed milk. \n\nSo how was it? Friggin awesome! Kind of like shaved ice cream. The texture, which is what i wasnt too impressed with when it comes to the other place, was perfect damn close to shaved ice cream. The taste was amazing. What's even better? The Cantaloupe. \n\nToo bad it's so late into summer. Their cantaloupe is nice and perfectly refreshing. The exact thing you need to help cool off on a hot as hell summer day. \n\nImproves...well the owners already know their deficiencies. One being they are in dire need of swapping out the A/C unit the plaza manager is too cheap to replace, and maybe some kind of underground or build a 2nd story to improve on parking.\n\n\nYelp 100 - 041 of 100"

0,"I can't quite understand why so many people like Buffet at Asia. My wife and I tried the Rainbow location a year or so ago and it was absolutely revolting. The serving areas were messy, the food overly greasy and unappealing and it all just felt extremely cheap and low-end.\n\nPerhaps I am picky because I come from Australia where we can get amazing Chinese food (sort of like how in the US you can get great Mexican due to the proximity to Mexico). The fact that I don't eat fish or seafood of any kind didn't help either - The place was VERY heavy on the seafood.  Vegetarians won't he happy either, unless you are one of those fake \""vegetarians\"" that thinks fish are vegetables.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for us about this place where the signs on the walls saying that due to wastage, if you left any food on your plate you would be CHARGED EXTRA FOR IT! I mean -really- part of the beauty of a buffet is that you get to OWN the food and decide what to eat. I don't want to have to clean up my plate for fear of trouble with the management. I'd be interested to know if this ludicrous policy is still in place, but I have no desire to ever eat here again and will never know."
0,"What an incredible disappointment! Not much more than a month after my wife and I visited this place before a Cardinal's preseason game in which we were told that burgers were not on the menu! What?!!! You're a burger joint. The place was empty and we listened to the excuses that the Fire Marshall had shut the oven down. We decided to stay and eat and were not impressed. We decided to give them another try later when we could actually order a burger. Hold onto your hat!!\n\nWe showed up at 12:30 on Sun, Oct 13 after an early movie at IPic to have drinks and lunch with friends thinking we would enjoy the beautiful weather on the patio and watch the Cardinals play the 49ers in an away game. After ordering our first round of drinks and an appetizer the game was turned off to instead show the Broncos game because the woman behind us was a Broncos fan. Are you *#%\u00a5 kidding me?!!! When I asked our server why he turned off the Cardinals game he said that she was there first and it was policy to turn the TV to what the first person asked. What a joke! I said to the server \""So if I had got here first and wanted to watch the news instead of the Cards game you would have obliged me?\"" He had no response and looked irritated. Well not as irritated as me young man!! I promptly asked for a to go box for our appetizer and reminded him what town we were in and the several hundred dollar tab he just missed out on. Paid my bill and let the rest of our party know that I would be hosting lunch at my home where Arizonans could watch their team play out of town on my big screen. In what parallel universe could you be in another city other than Scottsdale and watch your game be turned off airing your home team? Pathetic!! \nIt just goes to show how poor this ownership and management is that the locals were pushed out to make way for one Denver fan. We will never be back to this place again and after reading the other reviews I'm with the rest of them in asking \""How much longer before this place goes under?\"" \n\nI have half a mind to ask some friends if they'd like to be partners in a restaurant and show these idiots how to run a LOCAL bar and grill. What a waste."
0,"In one word: meh.\n\nThis is no Cafe Porta Alba, that's for sure. S2 is decorated in a pretty spartan style, and there's not much seating. Random tables stand in the backroom but with no stools.\n\nI got the sopressata pizza, and my roommate got the pepper and sausage one. They claim the pizzas cook quickly--and they do. We got ours in five minutes or so. The first thing that stuck out to me? Hardly any toppings. When I say \""sparse\"", I mean it. I had a couple small circles of salami, and the roomie's was sprinkled with pepper cubes and chunks of sausage. Again, we're paying for toppings, so why weren't they on the pizza?\n\nPrice-wise, at $8 or so, you get a good amount of pizza. The problem, though, is the quality. Both pizzas were undercooked. This is supposed to be in the brick oven/Neapolitano style, but they weren't well-done. The dough was meh. The cheese was there, but was sliding all over the pizza, which isn't supposed to happen.\n\nSo, there's my overly-underwhelming review. My advice? Stick to Ian's. Their pizzas may be crazy, but they're much better. If you're looking for this style, Cafe Porta Alba is the place to go--it's a little pricier, but the enormous jump in quality is well-worth it."
1,"Good overall. Only went for color safe shampoo and conditioner, but they have a good variety of hair care products for every type of hair- including treatments for damaged hair and for ppl who spend a lot of time in the pool.\nNot a huge store but it appeared to have a good selection in general.\nStaff very polite- asked if I needed help but didn't hover when I said no."

1,I'm going to get straight to the point. This is one of my favorite station casinos. I've won nice sums numerous times on the slots and today was my first time playing a sport's wager. It's a very welcoming casino and definitely has the local feel to it. I also love the Feast Buffet's Sunday Champagne Brunch! But I'll leave that part to another review. The only reason I am giving this casino 4 stars is because it lacks some of the bells and whistles that the Strip casino's have to offer. But hey if you're a local you should love it! Peace.
1,"absolutely amazing food. I hated Thai completely until I had this place. there seafood anything is awesome. I recommend there pad thai, there Singapore noodles and their fried rice. the soups are amazing to. Avoid the spring rolls as I didn't care for them. but the entr\u00e9es are simply amazing."
1,"Came here because I was tired of going to another place that messes up my coffee almost daily. Was told all about the different coffees they had I tried one of the suggested ones, which turned out to be really good. Their banana bread is awesome as well!"
1,"Upgrade you\nCan I up?\nLet me upgrade you!\nPartner, Let me Upgrade you!\n- Beyonce Knowles\n\nI'm a fan of Bally's because they upgraded my room to a more spacious suite for only $25 extra per night facing the strip.  Bally's offer a good Vegas experience becuase it has a good location on the strip.  Most mid to low price Vegas casinos offer a lame experience, but Bally's is good for a good price."
1,"I was in town for the PAPA 16 tournament and since my qualifying wasn't going well, decided to head out to the record stores and do some retail therapy.  As I was walking through Lawrenceville I noticed this place with pinball machines and a pinball theme and had to check it out.  Ordered a sandwich and played a few games.  The sandwich was most excellent as was the pinball.  The games all worked great and the re-themed EM pins were really cool and a lot of fun.  The only drawbacks were that it was absolutely dead on a saturday afternoon when I would expect there to be a few people hanging around and having a nice lunch, and it's almost so well done inside that it feels uncomfortable hanging about.  I think this needs a little more of the neighborhood dive feel to it to be honest.  I feel bad saying that as it was clearly a lot of work to construct and very well done."
0,"Wouldn't go back.  Extremely overpriced food, which didn't even taste good.  Service was slow.  No reason to eat here."
0,"Like many others I was lured in by the friendly young man out front announcing half priced appetizers for happy hour. Looking for a medium sized snack, sharing a couple of appetizers sounded like exactly what we needed. \nMy friend ordered a Caesar salad which she was not impressed with. Only ate it because she was starving and couldn't eat even half of it because it tasted old and wilted. So she changed it up and shared my appetizers...\nThe potato chip nachos sounded good in theory... and probably could have worked out well if they made an effort. The cheese in the places they out it was barely melted. The chips needed some salt or something and could have been cooked a little better, the beans they put on weren't drained so it left a swampy residue over the entire plate and completely put us off. Also ordered were the potato skins that were straight up raw potato in the middle because they weren't prepped properly. They were hard on the outside almost like they parcooked them  earlier and they sat for a while and then were finished when my ticket popped up in the kitchen.\nAside from the food I really have to mention the service.... in such a cool looking place they really need to take a look at themselves when they step out to serve people. The young man out front was outgoing and had a personality. The two guys behind the bar had no personality and no uniform to speak of- wouldn't have even known they worked there except they were pouring beers in between sitting down at the end of the counter and chatting.\nThe biggest issue of all was the lady server with crazy long hair. She wore it down when she started her shift and within minutes she was playing with it and put only some of it back. After that show of hairstyling in a restaurants dining room she did not wash her hands but instead continued to scratch her head and touch her face and THEN... grab bar straws by the drinking end and placed them in another tables drinks.\nI was out the door within seconds.\nOddly the gentleman at the door knew we didn't like it when we were leaving..... I hope this inspires them to make some changes and teach their employees about food safety."
0,"\""Before both of my feet fully entered Flicka's, I knew I had already contracted the Swine Flu..\"" Thanks to Georgie S, I now know why I have a sore throat, cough and achy body. Thanks Flicka's for giving me Swine Flu. \n\nThis place is really disorganized, the wait staff (the bartenders the waitresses the bussers) are all really snotty and were all rude, not to mention slow as the second coming. \n\nThe nicest person in that bar was the little Mexican flower guy who fell in love with me and gave me a pair of roses, free of charge. \n\nThe one good thing about this bar was the cheap beers. My Corona was $2.50 and the Bud Lights were $2. \n\nThe outdoor patio is cool, but it is filled with all the smokers so unless you want to catch lung cancer, it is smart to just stay inside. \n\nMy friends band played (I have seen them play at least a dozen times in a variety of venues) and the sound was so horrible. You couldn't hear vocals at all. \n\nIn between the 5 rock bands that played, they piped R&B music over the speakers. I thought this was a little strange.... and I also found the massive dance orgy that busted out to be a little strange.\n\nSome dude sent his wing-woman over to the bar while I was getting drinks to try and get me to join their table. She was the oldest looking wing-woman I have ever seen. It made me immediately want to cancel my tanning membership. \n\nWhat a really weird group of people here. Seriously. \n\nI didn't really care for the food. I consider myself a nachos connoisseur now that I date Dallas G, and these nachos were sub-par. \n\nI highly doubt I will ever be back to this weird ass place!"
1,"I'm glad I finally came to this place. A friend told me how good this place was but he never mentioned how nice this place was. I felt like I was at a tea party. The ambiance is great. Perfect for a date or even a big group. \n\nMy bf and tried a few appetizers, the flourless cake and a few beers. The gnocchi was my favorite and the meatballs were my bf's favorite. The pesto sauce in the gnocchi was so so good. I dipped everything else in it. I can't wait to try the salmon and a few other items on my next trip back, \n\nI saw the bar on my way out and am for sure going to try some of the cocktails too. It looked so relaxing and chill. Everyone was so nice and I loved the fact that it's down the street from me."
0,I have to say 808 was a waste of money.  My fish came out really fishy and my friend had to send his dish back for something else.  It was very expensive for some mediocre food and the server gave us terrible service because we didnt order wine to bring his check average up.  How does this place survive?
1,Love this place! Called in the morning for an appointment during my lunch break. They fit me in easily and I was out with time to spare-- had a gel color change. Worked quickly and quality was not compromised. I will absolutely be back!
0,They have a nice dining area but I have to say their food isn't up to par. I recommend The Big Fat Greek restraunt on tatum & shea
1,Great food. Cheap but high quality and nice atmosphere. Will definitely go back and recommend to friends.
0,"Avoid. Avoid. Avoid, Or you will be sorry--- \""I told you so!\"". Mediocre food for the price. Low class, untrained & unprofessional staff. They chew gums while in service. Terrible service.... and if you make a remark they talk you back as if they are doing YOU a favor. Never been treated so bad by low class- trailer park waiter. The idiot we had, never served the wine except for the tasting. When I asked for service he grabbed the bottle, annoyed,  and grossly emptied it into both our glasses holding it so high that wine just guttered out of it. Disgusting. Since I did not say Thank you, obviously, he looked at me in the eyes and said:\""You're welcome!\"". I asked him if he had a problem and he said \""Yes, usually when we serve people they say thank you!\"". I reported this moron's attitude to the manager who barely apologized,  switched waiter on us, did not offer us  a thing and charged us full price ($120 - no dessert- 2 persons) even after we waited another 40mns for our main dish.  This is a wannabe classy restaurant with tasteless food and animals waiters. I wrote ZERO SERVICE = ZERO TIP - YOU'RE WELCOME on the credit card slip. Las Vegas is not Bakersfield. We have plenty of choice. Do not fall for Canaletto. Yerk!!!  If you want excellent-outstanding service, excellent italian food and respectful staff, try Bertolini's. Even Olive Garden is a better choice........ Hey Canaletto! You're welcome !!! :-)"
0,"Heart and Soul is our go-to, but it was closed last night for a private party.  We had been to Gallagher's one time before, it was okay, so we crossed the parking lot for a second visit.\n\nIt will be our last.\n\nI thought the Yelps I had read from previous diners were a bit harsh, but last night we got the full \""Gallagher's experience\"".  Sign at the reception desk said: seat yourself.  We did, after searching thru a mostly empty dining room for a clean table.  We sat there maybe 5-6 miutes without a sign of a single staff.  I looked at my watch about then---7.45.  That's why I know it was twelve minutes later that the server finally showed up, sans menus.  She asked for our drink orders and then said, \""Oh, I guess you guys want menus?\""  (Um.,..yeah.)  About 5 minutes later, a Hispanic guy shows up with menus and asks if we'd been taken care of.  We said yes and he starts to walk away and we are like: wait---leave the menus.  He gives us this frantic look, like we are mugging him for the squares of laminated paper, but then he reluctantly hands them over.  (Score one for our team!)  A few minutes later, our server shows up with our drinks and some menus and she frowns at the menus we had scooped from the guy, puts our drinks on the table and starts to walk away, and DH says: no, wait, we are ready to order.  (We did't want to take the chance of losing her!)  I got the fish and chips, DH got the Cobb wrap with onion strings.  It arrived fast and ice-cold.  My chips (fries) were limp and greasy, fish was crispy looking and golden brown, but interior was dry and stringy---can we say over-cooked?  DH said his wrap was bland and dry---the tortilla was so bereft of moisture it was sucking the saliva out of his mouth.  His onion strings would have been delicious hot---they were surprising good even cold and congealed.  He did ask for some mayo to try to lube up the wrap, and seriously---she brought him about a teaspoon in a small black cup. (Gotta watch those food costs!)  The manager did do a drive-by a few minutes after we got our drinks but before our food arrived---how can I answer \""how's everything guys?\"" when \""everything\"" is iced tea and water with lemon?  (BTW, the iced tea was very good!)  He never came by to check in again. Neither did the server, although she did drop off the check about three minutes after the food---that's when DH was able to ask for the mayo.  \n\nLike another Yelper, we paid cash so we didn't have to endlessly wait for change and then got the heck out of there.  And no, we didn't leave a tip.  If our server didn't care about our dining experience, why should I care about her working experience?\n\nFrankly, horrible service and horrible food.  You know, we desperately need another reasonably-priced \""family\"" restaurant here in Cave Creek/Carefree---but Gallagher's isn't it.  So if you ever wonder why an attractive place with a decently varied menu is always mostly empty---read and believe the Yelps--I think they are only still open because they have like a bazillion tvs and (no pun attended) they are like the only game in town for that level of restaurant."
1,"Friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere,and healthy menu options make this place a great choice any time of the day."
0,"Where do we begin?   People have been telling us about the Old Town Tortilla Factory.  We were in Scottsdale and hungry and decided to try it out.   Had we stopped with just appetizers this review might be different. \nWe were greeted in a fairly empty restaurant by Jason - who claimed he was pulling double duty in the bar - which we found out later was a lie.  Oh sure - he WAS IN the bar, but not behind it working.\nWe ordered the chorizo queso as an appetizer and a couple of margaritas.   The margaritas come in those little plastic shakers, which have lose tops.  The appetizer was great and delish. The margaritas were weak with little or no alcohol.   I ended up ordering 3 and still didn't feel any buzz.  Jason never seemed around for an empty restaurant and when we walked in...the outside bar looked fairly empty...hmmmm\nWhen Jason finally arrived back to take our order, I proceeded to self-pour my margarita and the top fell off the shaker, pouring a margarita all over the table.  Jason didn't flinch.  All he said was that happens all the time and promptly noted that they don't give away free drink replacements when it happens.   So they know tops fall off, they still continue to use such tops for their weak drinks, and won't replace them.   Hmmm...\nWe were stunned.  We then discuss our orders with a drink spilled on the table.  I was vacillating between the sea bass and the snapper.  He said how good the snapper was so I ordered it.  Less than 5 seconds after I ordered, my lady said \""Try the sea bass it looked better\"" so we wait for Jason to return.  No Jason.  We call another waitress to find Jason (and find our own bus boy to clean the spilled rink on the table.).  When Jason returns, I tell him to change my order - he says \""Too late the chef already started it.\""  Again - we are stunned.  I can't change my order moments after I order it?  We are still trying to figuring out why he disappears in a nearly dead restaurant, so I say, \""I guess I'll have to stick with the snapper for your sake - I hope its good.\"" \nOur entrees finally arrive, and the snapper is unremarkable.  It's a whole fish - head and tail.  Snapper is a very bony fish so every bite is filled with bones. It's like a streamed fish.  No sauce and nothing to make it remarkable.  I take about three bony bites and then just stop.  Jason never came by during the meal to check on us.  He comes back about 15-20 later, never notices I didn't eat his shitty recommendation of fish but want to push more weak drinks, in flawed containers that fall apart onto us.  We refuse.  We get the check.  All the while through dinner, I stare at a stack of dirty plates from my appetizer of chorizo and empty spill glasses that never got picked up!\nNow I will digress.  We both worked for tips as kids, through high school and college.  TIPs are a privilege and not a right.  I don't think restaurant workers automatically deserve TIPs.  One earn TIPS.  My lady always feels bad not leaving a tip.  I never feel bad.  TIPs are about the hustle and making a client happy.  I saw none of this in Jason.   After much discussing with my lady - I left Jason ZERO tip.  Not even a penny.  I thought he sucked.  I thought his recommendation sucked.  I thought he was uncaring.  I thought his lack of empathy with a spilled drink, cleaning it up (He did tell us he was \""working\"" the bar...didn't he??) sucked.  I left him nothing and didn't feel bad about it at all.  I thought he was worthless and lazy.  \nWe get up and walk out of the restaurant.  We walk out the front door into the courtyard where the bar is and we see Jason.   Sure- Jason was in the bar....SITTING ON A BAR STOOL WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME while some blonde girl was behind the bar, tending it.  My lady just smiled at me and says, \""For once I agree with you and can't wait until you tell the world about this on Yelp.\""  \nSuggestions to the restaurant:\n1) Where is your manager?  No one is walking the restaurant asking how everyone and everything is?  You allow your associates to sit in the bar and watch a football game?  My drink wasn't cleaned up nor was my food order corrected because some assclown is sitting on a bar stool watching a football game???\n2) Don't serve drinks in shitty plastic shakers that fall apart.  Don't tell patrons you know this and still continue to do it.   Replace your weak drinks when spills happen since it's your own damn fault.\n3) Fire Jason.  Look up worthless and lazy in the dictionary and you'll see his picture.  There's a reason people like him make no money in the restaurant business and he is a piss-poor reflection of what your restaurant could be.  For all we know, maybe he was the manager or part of the owners family which is why his ineptitude is accepted. \n4) For patrons?  Don't go to this place.  Around the corner on the other side of Scottsdale is a very old gem named Los Olivos.  Go there.  Your experience will be much better."
1,"Hola, Paco. Gracias por la buena experiencia. \n\nBesides the food being good, their customer service is fantastic! My mom and her friend were in town and we wanted them to try Paco's Tacos. My mom ordered the brisket taco, but after a couple bites decided that it wasn't what she expected. Our server was very gracious and made the night out wonderful and got something my mom would enjoy...tres leches cake. \n\nI've been there a couple times and each time I've had a terrific experience. The staff are super friendly and the managers aim to please. The chips and salsa are delicioso and I have to force myself to stop eating them so I won't ruin my dinner. I've ordered the shrimp and veggie fajitas each time and they are yummy! \n\nGreat location in the SouthPark neighborhood with a great atmosphere! When the weather is warm, it's nice to sit on the patio. The offer great specials during the week...por ejemplo, I think Mondays after 8pm their fajitas are half off.  \n\nThanks Paco's and staff for making our night out enjoyable!"
1,"Sure being in a strip mall doesn't make it fancy restaurant, but as a place to grab a filling lunch or a to go order it works just fine! The lamb gyro was HUGE and tasty. My friend said the chicken gyro was tasty too. \nThey also have some good specials. Bring a friend and get the 2 gyros with fries + 1 drink deal for around $12.\n\nI would go back, and if you are looking for a filling Greek meal, you should too!"
0,"I've been to Joe's quite a few times over the last two years being that I work in the area. Service and food quality has been in a steady decline to the point where it's at now. Let's get started.\n\nPizza at Joe's: The main attraction to the monster! Joe's prides itself in its pizzas and has won 'awards' for just that. The display is usually filled with pizzas which they pop a piece from and toss in the oven for a nice hot slice. However long the pizza sits out is anyone's guess, supply and demand I suppose. But let's be honest here for a second, the pizza is sub par. About one step above fast food pizza, there's just nothing that makes it a must have gourmet experience. Ingredients are decent quality, very little actual food magic is happening in regards of making the pizza taste good. It's dough, sauce and cheese with toppings. This is ever more apparent with the appearance of Naked City Pizza that just down the street from Joe's. Where you'll pay a bit more to enjoy some quality pizza. Not the same thing you've had everywhere else...\n\nThis ingredient theme runs rampant throughout the entire menu. Chicken fingers are coated with over salted bread crumbs. Their alfredo pasta is plagued by an oily sauce that barely adheres to itself, let alone the sauce or chicken. Jalapeno poppers, mozarella stick, chicken salads. You name it, the quality is all the same, and it's sub par. If you're looking for a CHEAP place to spend money and eat pizza, this is it. The place is just that, cheap. I don't know whom they fed pizza to in order to win any awards but any adult with a functioning and understanding pallet will be let down by this place.\n\nCustomer service has only ever been an issue in regards to messing up orders, and they do this A LOT. Multiple times have I ordered their chicken wings, tenders, etc. and requested certain sauces on the side. At one point I ordered chicken wings with hot sauce and hot sauce on the side. I ended up getting chicken wings with no sauce on it and only a cup of ranch on the side. Just today I had ordered chicken tenders with sauce on the side, and instead got it on my chicken tenders. \n\n2 out of 5. If you're ok with a quick bite to eat on the go, enjoy Joe's. With Naked City Pizza having just opened up down the street from this location (next to the Hofbrauhaus) i'll be recommending them instead. Review to come soon."
0,"A group of us came here to celebrate a friend's promotion. We came in early and sat at the bar as we waited for the rest of the party. Drink prices are standard for a Strip location. As a Mexican restaurant they are known for their margaritas and have a menu that highlight their various concoctions. I had wanted to try a couple of them, but they did not have certain components to make them. I went with a micholada and it was good. They didn't have clamato, so they just used bloody mary mix instead. They offered us chips and salsa after our second drink. The seasoning on those warm chips makes for crack.\n\nOnce we were seated, it took some time for us to get service. 10 minutes pass and no one showed up. 15 minutes goes by and still no one. We were told the server didn't know he had the table. Honest mistake. Eventually, our server did come. We had some issues with what was in stock. I had wanted 2 different kinds of whiskey, but they didn't have either. \n\nFood wise: The appetizers were delicious. We got the ceviche, a queso fundido, chicken tacos, and the guacamole. The fish was tender and seasoned well. The acidic component mellowed out with the use of cucumbers. The queso was okay. The chorizo didn't give as much of a kick as I was hoping. The fact that they serve it in a iron skillet allows the cheese to crisp on the bottom. Scraping up all of it and eating it is half the joy. I didn't try the tacoes, but the others seemed to enjoy it. The guacamole was probably my favorite. The put pomegranate seeds on top. It gave it a touch of tart and sweetness that was the most unique item on the menu. As for entrees, nothing was spectacular. The sweet corn enchiladas were a decent vegetarian option, but lacked a countering flavor, so it was just sweet. The burger was cooked perfectly and was juicy. I just wouldn't come to a Mexican restaurant and think burger. My friend enjoyed his chicken torta. I stole a bite of the chicken enchiladas and weren't impressed.\n\nOne of our party members paid before they left and it took some time to get our waiter to come back. We had still wanted to order some more drinks, but by the time he came back we were ready to leave. I know they are still new and will eventually work out the kinks."
0,Well apparently first time there was a fluke.  Took my shih-tzus back.  Granted they were matted and needed to be shaved. But I got them back and they did a horrible job on one of them. But my problem is they were groggy for the rest of the day like they had been sedated or something.  Later that evening they started getting back to their normal selves.  For dogs that are constantly happy and running around....it makes me wonder.  My son is extremely upset of how the ladies talked to him about his dog and refuses to take his dog back.i may be wrong about sedating them but if you are going to - you need to get permission from the owner.
1,The pizza was one of the best I ever had! Seems to be family owned. Good atmosphere. Friendly staff.
0,"Food: Pretty blah is my general impression after my second time there (first for lunch, last time for dinner). I would not be coming back either. Meats were all dry. Beef Wellington was a major letdown. Sushi selection was non-existent. Salmon or tuna? I like pizza, so I have nothing bad to say about it, but I rarely say anything bad about pizza, that would be blasphemy. Crab legs were pre-split however they were intensely salty. Shrimp cocktail was probably the best thing. Desserts were good, the best was the creme brulee however that went with the quickness and I couldn't find anymore. \n\nDrink: Soda. Numerous refills due to salty crab legs.\n\nService: Quick to clear away plates and refill water/soda.  \n\nAmbiance/Crowd: Vegas style. Spacious and tacky. Young people, old gamblers, families, a slice of the world."
0,"Over the holidays, I went to Presto Nails with my mother-in-law and her sister. They had a pedicure, and I had a mani/pedi. I have always had a good experience at Presto. However during this outing, I could have sworn that my nail tech just rinsed off the equipment that she used on me. When she returned to the station, she got what appeared to be one of those \""sterile\"" packs and shoved the tools in and sealed it up! I was dumbfounded. I never had any question about the cleanliness of this place until then. When we left, my husband's aunt expressed her disgust of how her nail tech just rinsed the callus remover (grater) and put it back in the rotation. I hadn't even mentioned my experience. That is disgusting, and I will always dissuade people from going to this establishment if I can!"
0,** adding **\nI just emailed their customer relations to file a complaint about our valet parking wait experience on 12/26.  we'll see what they say about this.\nMGM should know better on how to handle these types of situations.  understaffing excuse is not reasonable as customer spend alot of their $$$$$ to stay here.  making people wait for over than an hour for their cars outside is unreasonable and unexcusable.  they have been in this businesss for years!
0,"I usually like going to this market because they have great deals on the produce. Some of the staff though...*clears throat*... So Friday, I decided to stop in and pick up a few things. I started checking out and the cashier, Virginia was nice, but the sacker, not so much. Quite an a-hole actually.  Ole short Bud Bundy from Married With Children looking guy. I think he may be newer than most of the other people there. \n\nSo I got different types of apples that were located in the bins specifically saying .89/lb. The 1st set of apples, the cashier rings them up  @ 1.29/lb and I tell her that the bin where I got them said .89/lb. Virginia says, well they're 1.29/lb and then asks me do I still want them. I needed apples so I said fine.  They same thing happened with the 2nd set of different apples.  Why would I pay $1.29/lb for apples when I could get ORGANIC from a store such as Sprouts or Fry's? Like...whet? So the bagger says \""Well I can see the sign from here and they say 1.29\"" I say \""I didn't get those there, I got them in the bins by the oranges and strawberries.\"" He then goes off to the section that I just told him that I DIDN'T get the apples, and then proceeds to come back and tell me the 1.29/lb price. Sir, seriously?  I again told him that was not the section where I got the apples and he tells me, \""Well  I'm not about to go running around the store.\"" I'm sorry, whet? Are you not at work? Are you not getting paid? I said to him \""You act like this store is huge, you only went about 15 steps and didn't even go to where I said I got them.\""  Hell if he didn't want to be a sacker/runner, he should've applied to be a cashier so that he could just stand there and just have to move his arms!\n\nI can't stand when people go into work and act like it kills them to, ya know, WORK. If you don't want to be at work CALL IN. Nobody needs the attitude! Like I said, I like Ranch Market because of their great deals on produce, but some of the male workers they have there...*side eye*. Also make sure the the right items are under the right prices"
1,"Go ahead and stuff yourself.  It's worth it.  Mmm... I want to have their polenta................................ and BREAD PUDDING!!!!\n\nYou have to remember that it is a place that serves in bulk, and it's where you can get the most (or least, if you just want to sit there) out of your dollar.  It's got a nice atmosphere and good selection.  Service is good too.  I mean, when you compare it to places like Todai... this place is fabulous...\n\nLong lines... so try not to go while everyone is planning on going."
0,"Worst food I have experienced on my trip to Vegas. Our server never came to our table, the bus boy was nice about getting refills, for the price not worth it."
0,"I left my card at Town Tavern Sunday night.  I've been calling every day to ask them if I can come by and get my card.  Today, about $2000+ in charges posted to my credit card account.  \n\nThere is a bar tender or waitress at this place who is either using my card or sold my card to someone.  I wouldn't go to this place, EVER."
1,"Food was fantastic but don't expect to order off the menu. Just ask for whatever they want to serve you. No soap in the bathroom, they said they were ordering a new soap dispenser...\nMost items were fried. The rice/beans mix was dry and bland. It feels like you're traveling in a third world country. First world prices.\nMy new favorite spot!"
1,"A great family run, taste of Italy ristorante, that I say: \""Ciao bella\""!\n\nWe arrived last night looking forward to a well prepared Italian meal. Our expectations were peaked by all our Yelp friends, raving about the personal service and delicious old style Italian food. We weren't disappointed.\n\nThe owner, Pasquale greeted us as we came in, and sat us in the back.  It would provide a good place to observe his personal touch with all the customers.  Our server Cody came by almost immediately to ask if we had brought any wine, and if he could open it and bring us glasses.  As others have noted, Ristorante Giuseppe is a Bring Your Own (BYOB) place.\n\nOur oldest was celebrating her Birthday Day, so we were in a festive mood.  I've taken some photos of the interior of the restaurant. Clearly they were working on that Italian Grotta feel.  It has some buca di beppo type wall decorations.  But unlike that chain, here it's decorated by actual family photos and vacations shots. Very genuine!  Just like Pasquale.\n\nWe started out with the bruschetta.  It came with four pieces of italian bread for $10.95.  It might have seemed pricey, though the tomatoes were sweet and had a interesting topping of several cheeses. Delicious.  We next shared the Antipasto.  It was a very full plate of greens, meats and cheeses for $8.95.  The dressing was a light oil and vinegar that was just right.\n\nFor our entree, we each tried something different.  I went for the capellini with their homemade Neopolitan sauce.  Cody talked me into one of their meatballs, which was good.  But, not as good as their pasta and red sauce.  Sometimes with a marinara, if it's left to cook too long it can get bitter.  Not here, it was naturally sweet with chucks of tomato.\n\nMy wife ordered her favorite dish of Chicken Parmigiana, that came with spaghetti for $14.95. It wasn't a pounded piece of chicken cutlet, but instead an entire breast. Very nice!  Our daughter ordered the spicy Pasta Alex  for $15.95.  The menu describes it as the Chef's creation -- of pasta in a cardinale/pesto sauce with roasted garlic and spicy, crumbled, Italian sausage.  It was outstanding!  The heat came from the crusted red peppers and was just right.  The sauce actually reminded me more of a vodka cream reduction.  It was sweet and full of flavor.  Clearly the best of all the dishes!\n\nFor dessert, we tried the flour-less Chocolate cake, the Tiramisu and a Cannoli for $4.95 each.  I've taken a picture of the Tiramisu, because it came as an individual piece of two moist lady fingers. Wow!  \n\nIf you're out and it's late, I would highly recommend coming here just for dessert and espresso.  It would be well worth it.\n\nOur bill came to $88 in change including taxes but before gratuities. It was hand written and not itemized.  Another one of those personal touches which some might find quirky.\n\nAfter getting home, I exchanged a bunch of messages with Yelp'er Michael T on how delicious the sauces were at Giuseppe's.  It's that unbridled enthusiasm and passion that folks have for this restaurant and it's owner Pasquale that make it special. \n\nIf you are looking for a white table cloth, foo foo experience; you might be disappointed and not understand the beauty of Ristorante Giuseppe.  But, we weren't, and we'll be back real soon.\n\nEnjoy!"
0,NO is the simple word to this team of fools that do really shitty work. No No never again that simple. They totally screwed me. Good bye. Brakes are making soo many noises after a new brake job and they never fixed the AC either. Do NOT GO HERE!
0,"We had dinner there this evening around 530, Service was very poor and very slow. The food followed the service,Poor. I agree with Jeff K this place has struck out. Their prices aren't that reasonable, You pay PF Chang prices for a low grade Panda express ( sorry Panda Express)  We will not return to ta ta bistro."
0,"The staff was RUDE!  I understand that Saturday nights are busy, but that was no excuse for how they treated my family. I was in with my mother and her friend in order to help my mother's goddaughter celebrate her birthday. Someone knocked my mother's friend's drink all over her, and, being classy, she didn't cause a scene. The staff member came over, yelled at my MOM for causing a mess, and proceeded to push her around by driving the mop right up to her feet. This was after several rude interactions we had, and it was the final straw for me. I will never go back. There are too many other options in Vegas, and quite frankly, the club right across the hallway in the Mirage was more fun and had staff who were less impressed with themselves."
1,"e2 has a great menu that is always changing with a focus on seasonal and local. The four times I've been I've always had great service with no attitude from anyone.\n\nI love the food, everything's been delicious and I try to vary what I eat each time--pretty easy considering their ever changing menu. I especially love their desserts, which are handled with a kind of care I could only expect from the Enrico family.\n\nI'll definitely continue to come back to e2, something about just makes me happy.\n\nI wrote a longer review of e2, with plenty of delicious photos on my web site. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/09/culinary-merits-bryant-street/"
1,"J and I decided to go to First Friday, just for the sake of trying out the food trucks!  We discovered the little gem, Jamburritos!!  \n\n$6 Chicken Jamburrito = tasty and very filling!!  :) And more than enough food to feed both J and myself.  I will say though, that the burrito could have been rolled a little tighter. \n$2 hush puppies = Super tasty!!!\n\nThe jamburrito had a nice little kick of spice to it.  Very Tasty!!  J and I were stuffed after each of us having half of the burrito (along with sharing half a hamburger from Ralph's).  Well worth the $8.00 for the burrito and hush puppies."
0,good and worth trying\ni would recommend
0,Just like its name nothing is special about this place. It's in a casino so its overpriced and low quality. There is no wow factor and the buffet is not the world's largest. I would stick to off the strip for Indian. A  fast food indian gourmet with live entertainment and modern deco would have worked better. No signature dishes and the bar is small and hidden and nothing special. I would have made it into bhangara bar with fusion tapas.
0,"The pizza and calzones are just OK here.  I've been here several times.  The atmosphere is pretty good, especially at night.  I wish the food was a bit better though. For the pizza, I found the sauce a bit watery and crust to be mediocre.  The calzones are OK but I've had better.  The appetizers are OK as well.  I did enjoy the dessert.\n\nHowever, the staff has been quite friendly every time I go to meet friends there."
0,"Ridiculous in every way....\n\nI've been parking at the meters downtown for about 10 years.  When I was going to school at Point Park and I had to pop into school for something or even go to a quick hour long class I'd usually park at the meters because it was cheaper than parking in a garage.  Long gone are those days!\n\nI just recently went downtown for a quick lunch and decided to park at a meter....well actually,  was in a hurry and the 3rd ave garage was full.  So I plunked in a quarter and watched the digital meter say 5.  WHAT?! It hit me right then that I would probably never park at a downtown meter again.  Seriously ridic!  I mean, I thought 7 minutes for .25 was a bit much....but this takes the cake....the whole delicious cake, right away!\n\nI know there's been an ongoing debate about keeping the meters being enforced until 10pm (which was revoked temporarily), but if that goes back into effect it's like saying to anyone who lives outside of downtown: \""don't bother coming downtown because if you do we're going to charge the heck out of you!\""  \n\nI won't even get into the parking garages.  I'll just say this...do they really want us downtown?  How are we going to keep the revitalization going if we can't even afford to park there!!"
0,"I was on a team of local artists who wanted to display our art on Fair Trade's walls. Their waitresses were absolutely cold, useless, not helpful to us, and unsupportive. They did not make us feel welcome as local artists but instead pressured us to leave when we were setting up because they were cleaning and closing. I ordered food from them and their service was slow. Then they gave me the wrong dish and didn't do a thing about it, even though I was an artist. Then, when we sold a piece of art, they didn't tell us but took 20%!!! What kind of business does that without ever telling us? If we had agreed to it at the start, then ok, but this was not ok. And their manager was always too busy to talk to us, and sent us hunting around the two locations to find her to get our money. I do not support this kind of business and I recommend that if you are a local artist or support local artists, take your business to a better managed, more customer-oriented place, not a cold, rude, unfriendly place like Fair Trade."
1,I like this place.  I don't get a chance to go very often but every time I go it's always good.  I always have the Seared Tuna.  Great place to sit outside and eat when it is cooler.
0,"The worst! If I could rate a zero I would. This gym is always dirty, and equipment is either broken or outdated. Avoid this location."

0,"I'm not the type to complain or be vocal about bad experiences, but I really feel the need to write a review after my very negative experience at Orange Sky last night. \n\nIt was early Sunday afternoon and I had called 3 times to make a reservation for the restaurant after hearing great things about it. The first two times my call went directly to a voicemail asking me to leave a message with my desired reservation time and that someone would get back to me. As I was uninterested in leaving a message, I called back again and my call was answered by someone. I made a reservation for two people at 7:45pm that night (Sunday) and we planned on arriving a few minutes early to grab a cocktail in the lounge while the sun was setting. \n\nWe arrived quite early (around 6:45pm) and let the hostess know that we were there and would grab a drink while waiting for our table. We mentioned that we'd love to be seated early, if possible, and we were told that \""it should be about that time\"" (7:45pm) when our table would be ready. We understood, since it was Arizona Restaurant Week and we assumed the restaurant was incredibly busy (you aren't able to see the restaurant from the lounge area, so we couldn't tell). \n\nWe went to grab a drink at the bar and unfortunately, the bartender either was not behind the bar or had his back to us. After about 15 minutes, we were able to get a drink and have a seat. We relaxed for quite some time and later learned that it was the bartender's first night - understandable, but should have a bit more training as to not ignore customers when there are only about 4 people sitting at the bar. We went to sit outside on a small balcony right off the lounge.\n\nAt around 7:40pm, we started to get antsy and went inside to check on our spot and let them know that we had been on the balcony in case they missed us. We told them \""we were out on the patio and just wanted to make sure you knew we hadn't left\"" since no one had said a word to us since we had been there. The hostess' response was, \""We're waiting on our servers to catch up. You'd like to sit on the patio?\"" We replied, \""We'd be happy to sit on the restaurant patio, however, we'd like to be seated inside or out - whichever was first available.\"" She replied, \""Oh. I'll keep that in mind.\""  We were confused as to what just happened and thanked her although we felt she was giving us an attitude and sat back down. \n\nAt 8:15pm, when we still had not been seated or even approached by the hostess even though our reservation had been 30-minutes prior, we debated just leaving. We agreed that we'd give it 2 more minutes and we would cancel our reservation and head somewhere we knew we'd get good service. Just a moment after that, someone came up to us to tell us that our table was ready. However, we didn't receive an apology or anything. We definitely expected more from a restaurant that was so highly rated.\n\nWe were then walked back, through the velvet roped entrance, to the dining room. I must say, the space is absolutely gorgeous. Definitely a winner in the ambiance department. However, we were absolutely stunned when we arrived in the dining room and it was quite empty. There weren't many seated tables at all - which made us disappointed that we waited so long to be seated.... definitely a sign that they were understaffed.\n\nWe were seated at a booth inside, and waited for our server. And waited. After about 15 minutes of waiting, our server finally came by to get our drinks. We had decided to take part in the Restaurant Week Menu and were asked to put our entire order - drinks, meal and dessert - in all at once. We obliged, and waited. We weren't served our first course until 9:15pm. \n\nWhen it arrived, we were definitely underwhelmed. The salmon was over-seasoned and overcooked. The soup was marginal, and the potatoes were hard. One thing that was great was the steak - although it was very small, it was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. Unfortunately, our server didn't come back at all throughout our meal to check on us until we were just about through and she swooped our plate away from us without asking if we were finished. \n\nAlso, the women's restroom was dirty and there were paper towels all over the floor. Definitely not something I expected. \n\nFor spending over $160 on the meal and drinks for two, the service was unacceptable and the food was just okay. Overall, the experience we had was only a 2 out of 5. And it would be a 1 if the ambiance and view weren't as good. \n\nI hate writing negative reviews, but Orange Sky should make an effort to work on their customer service. Once that is fixed, I'm sure it will be a great spot for a special occasion."
0,"On top of the rate they quote you, you will have to pay city resort tax and sales tax but then they surprise you with a 28 Dollar phone and Gym tax whether you want to use their services or not. The room I have for $200 night has no view"
1,Yay!!! I second the first review!  Blimpie's is bomb and I will never walk in Subway ever again because I hate walking out smelling like bread!!!!  The guys who work here are all super sweet.. and even the women are too... shocking for me to say!  Much cheaper than Jersey Mike's too!
1,"This is a great, cheap place to get high quality paper, pens, pencils and a variety of cards for just about every occassion.  As I live in Marchmont during term time it's an excellent place to visit for friendly service and a new notebook.  The owner is very pleasant helped me out massively when I came in whilst he was closing up to get a last minute Mothers' Day card.  He also does a wide selection of wrapping paper which would suit for every event.  \nMarchmont Stationery offers a well stocked, local shop with a friendly atmosphere and very reasonable prices."
0,"I made a mistake and came back... thought I would give this Whataburger  another try... fries were good and hot this time but burger was cold, dry and what part of \""Whataburger with cheese NO mustard, NO pickle don't they understand? WOW who are they hiring to work here? They seem to speak English they just seen to understand it... it's too bad Whataburger use to have such a fantastic product... I guess this is why we see fewer and fewer Whataburgers around... if the quality and service disappear so do the customers and eventually the business.... to bad so sad..."

I'm a local and I will definitely return with my cute cup and stamp card!"
1,"This was the easiest furniture buying expereince ever. I had already bought he bulk of my furniture elsewhere and needed something a little more reasonably priced and so we went in the roomstore. The sales person immediatly helped us and wasn't pushy or annoying. He wrote down measurements for me, got us discounts, and arranged delivery all within less time than anywhere else I have shopped. \n\nThe customer service called several days before the delivery to confirm the address and then again the day before with the delivery time window. The delivery people showed up on time and were in and out in minutes and very nice. I was a pleasant expereince for something that is usually a hassle. This isn't the highest quality furniture but when you need something really reasonably priced, this is the place!"
0,Super rude. Took my mom's car in and they stole her phone charger. Also pushed a variety of flushes needed and never called us when the car was ready.
1,"Mmm...Chicken and Pine Nut salad and a glass of wine. Heaven.\n\nSauce is such a cool hangout. They offer the best pizzas and pasta (and salad!) that you will ever have in your life! This location in Dana Park is fantastic, but it is super busy (a testament to the great food, mind you).\n\nIf you haven't been here, you need to get here."
0,By far the worst possible service ever tonight.  I tried to order two filet of fish meals.  They said no two orders after 12 midnight?  Then they found one extra fish and said they will drop it?!?  I will never visit this McDonald's again!  By far the worst possible guest service ever.  This is a franchise McDonald's Corvette with McDonald's plates? You know who you are. You should fire all that worked tonight.  I am better going to the McDonald's in Walmart.  At least the personnel there can give me my order.  I will tell just about everyone I know about this experience.  Obviously there needs to be better training at this location.  All of the cashiers suddenly disappeared from the drive through window? Makes me wonder???
1,"If you are looking for a friendly and family oriented dental practice, this is the place for you!  Jaime is the best dental hygienist I have ever been to, so thorough and gentile at the same time.  These guys really focus on the details...from coordinating with your insurance company before you come in, to working you into their schedule for your needs, to high technology that makes the appointment faster and easier on the patient, they take great care of their patients.  Such a difference from my previous dentist, I'm happy to say these guys are my new favorite dentist!  Definitely the best dental practice in Phoenix!"
1,"Really lovely coffee and cakes and whatnot with fast, free wifi and a tolerant attitude towards people working there for fairly extended times. Perhaps, a bit let down by the massive & astoundingly slow-moving queue, which is about the only bad thing I can say about it."
1,"Reliable, extraordinary customer service, and the cleaning was first-rate as well. The owner went above and beyond to help me out by finding me a crew on very short notice, and who were willing to drive out of their normal service area.  I was very happy with the work and the customer service was top-notch.  Highly recommend!"
1,Great little shop.  Picked up a rda with drip tip and had it drilled and coiled on the spot.  Very friendly staff.
1,"The first time I went to Durant's was with my little brother.  What makes this interesting is you have to know that when we go to steak restaurants with each other we order the biggest piece of meat on the menu.  Usually that isn't a problem but at Durant's the biggest steak is a 48 oz porterhouse.  We looked at each other and knew we were in trouble.  Luckily you can order it for 2 but that is still 24 oz a piece.  Also, whatever is on their bread is amazing I can never tell because it is so dimly light in the place.  But it is delicious.  Even more sweet is that they have servers walking around filling your glasses with Evian water.  The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is when the steak came out and we were in awe.  It was freaking great.  The best steak I have ever had.  I also had a several chocolate martinis and as the other reviews state they were strong.  I was so blitzed at the end of the night I don't even remember if we finished the steak.  I know we ordered dessert because I found it in my fridge later in the night.\n\nI love that you can walk on the red carpet through the kitchen into the restaurant.  Can you say Goodfellas?  Although no one brought us our own table.  The red velvet walls and the dim lighting make it a very relaxing environment and I love the booths.  This is the best of Phoenix history. What else can I say!!!"
0,"Worst 15 dollars that I have ever spent and that was just for lunch. Let me explain.\n\nI come in on a Wednesday around 11:30 am. I am greeted by the host and shown to a table. Since I have never been here before, I am briefed on the process of getting my food. They give you two of what appears to be small dog food bowls and a small dipping sauce type of cup. One bowl you put in veggies and the other meat. For the dipping sauce type of cup, yup you guessed it, different sauces to mix in to your choices when it is being cooked.\n\nOnce you are done selecting your choices, you go up to the counter and hand it off to whoever is there that will cook it on the big circular flat top grill. You have to specify what kind of carb you want cooked with your ingredients like brown rice, noodles, etc. Then when its done cooking, your server will  bring it out to your table.\n\nNow what I just described doesn't sound bad now does it? What im about to break down for you should convince you not to come here or at least if you try it, you will be uttering, \""Oh, that's what Roger T was talking about in his review.\""\n\nFirst off, you have two options to decide before you start eating. Single trip or all you can eat. Prices are as follows: Lunch 8.99. Dinner 10.99. Add 4 dollars more to do the all you can eat option. By the way, it used to be 3 dollars.\n\nSince I was really hungry and planned on making multiple trips to get my money's worth, I chose the 13 dollar all you can eat. That is just for the food yall. Drinks are not included. I decided just to have water.\n\nSo I do my thing and try to cram as much meat and veggies into my bowls. Their meat and veggie choices all seem to be housed in tiny containers which makes you feel like a pig if you are trying to get a lot of a certain meat or veggie. By the way, the only difference between lunch and dinner is for dinner you get calamari and scallops. That's great news you say? Well, based on what I have seen, I wouldn't be surprised if these were tiny little cut up pieces.\n\nI sit down and wait for my food. After about 5 minutes later, I received it in a weird odd sized bowl/plate? When I see my food, I swear I thought I put a lot of veggies and especially meat since I am a carnivore. What you gotta understand is when all these items you select are grilled together, they shrink a lot. \n\nAfter I finished my bowl, I was ready to go and grab some more food. This is where the deception is because in order for you to go up and get more food, you have to tell your server exactly that and they will go get you new bowls. This is where you will notice the difference between these guys and other traditional Mongolian Grills. The ones im familiar with, you grab your own bowls and do your thing. The only waiting you do is for the cooking. Not these guys. Sometimes it takes a while for the server to come around just so you can ask for more bowls. Then you have to wait for them to come back with your bowls. Then you have to wait for it to be cooked. When it gets done cooking, it sits on the counter until your server picks it up and puts it on your table.\n\nSo you see this is where my gripe is. By the time I came around to my third serving, I was starting to feel that full feeling which doesn't make sense because at other places, I can easily go through 3 servings and not feeling full at all. The process that you have to go through to get your food, whatever you ate prior is starting to settle which gives you the im not hungry feeling any more. \n\nMy total bill came up to about 14 and some change. I put 15 bucks on the table and walked away. My server was slow in everything. Don't get me wrong. Its not like I was in a rush but at the same time I don't have all day. I think this place is a scam. Their process purposely slows everything down so you don't get to eat as much as you really want. The day I went, it didn't get really busy until about 12. When it gets really busy, you will have to wait even longer in between each serving. \n\nSo you see, it really isn't worth it to eat here whether you choose all you can eat or not. I recommend going to the Fiesta Buffet just up the street off of Lake Mead for their Mongolian Grill. Lunch is 7 bucks and dinner is 10 bucks with a player card. You not only get two big bowls to put ingredients in, but the only time you wait is when it is being cooked. Plus they have other choices there and not just the Mongolian. Its not the best but it sure as hell beats out these guys. This also will prompt me to check out Stir Krazy Mongolian Grill on Paradise Rd since I heard good things about them."
0,"When you are headed/leaving the stadium, just pass by this place.\n\nPizza is mediocre at best.\n\nIf you're starving, wasted, etc, grab a slice and get outta there.  I'm sure Pittsburgh has much better pizza than this place.\n\nLocation. Location. Location. does not equal good pizza.\n\nThey just got there first."
0,"Oh Dear Lord!  Can I get a Xanax?!\n\nFor us parents this is a necessary evil.  Chuck E Cheese's, in my opinion, as a whole have gone downhill over the years.  It's just not quite what it use to be.  The now robotic Chuck E. makes the experience a little less special and the pizza leaves even more to be desired than it use to.  Nowadays, the staff can make or break your experience.  That and the parenting skills of the other patrons.  Sure, this is a place for your kids to be kids but it's not an excuse to let your child do as they please and run around screaming like an animal.  Do us all a favor and parent your child(ren).\n\nWill I return?  Absolutely!  I know the joy that my daughter gets from this place and I couldn't deprive her of that.  Will we ever have another birthday party there?  No way!  Incredibly overpriced and there's not enough Advil in the world!  The package 'upgrades' add dollars upon dollars to your final bill just to award the children with more plastic trinkets that are broken before the end of the party.  If they survive beyond the party, they are in the trash within a week's time.  \n\nI think the staff is hit or miss here and I think they could do a better job at keeping the place clean.  I also think they need to better position the staff at the front because on countless occasions I've had to stand at the counter waiting to be served.\n\nWhy don't you serve beer!?!?!  Other locations do and I knew that would be the only thing to get me through a 6 year old birthday party!  Talk about disappointed!  What are you doing to me?!?!?  Selling beer is like selling sanity to all of the dads in the place!  Easy money!  You're losing out on so much business!  A golden opportunity to gain additional revenue.  Get it together Chuck E."
0,"Did you change owners or managers? We used to love this place and visited every time that we were in Phoenix. Well known for the very HOT and delicious food, we were very disappointed on our recent visit. The food was not spicy at all, so much for those who like it hot, which is their logo!! One of our guests was even served a large portion of FAT (more than half of the meat in the meal) in their carnitas, you would have thought that the cooks would have seen this and not served it!! Will not be coming back next time."
0,"I like their soup dumplings, but their noodle soup is so so. The noodles are ok but the broth doesn't have much depth and their braised beef isn't very flavorful. \nTheir chili oil is little too cooked for my taste. \nI will still go here for dumplings but not for noodle soups."

Again...I love the little area it is in...almost like not being in Vegas (which can be a nice escape when you live here)."
1,Hey forget what you heard! This bar is beyond awesome with cheap and an awesome beer selection! Bartenders and staff make you feel like part of the family because that's what they are about.

0,"I'm only giving this review 1 Star because the system won't post without a star. Where do I begin?.. I switched to Homelife Protection home warranty last Sept 2012 since my other Warranty co price was going to increase sharply and previous service call experiences were unsatisfactory. Today I called Homelife to get service ASAP due to Water heater not working since Saturday. I even submitted a claim online. Never recieved an email reply showing recieved and being handled ASAP. Called Monday morning and was advised they would have someone call me shortly and explained it may cost me an additional $850.00 for replacement of water heater if has to be replaced. Now in the details of what is covered it states they cover up to $500. for water heaters. I had already priced water heaters at 2 different places and found them priced from aprox $218.00 and up.  The warranty co had advised the installation and additional parts needed are not included and i would also still need to pay the $45.00 service call. I advised I had read that they can opt to pay us the $ instead for the replacement. Now this is where it gets interesting. The warranty advisor checked our acct and stated there had been NO Payments since Oct 2012.  I advised that's impossible since I was set up on Auto draft since acct set up last Sept 2012. I looked at my checking acct on line all the way back to Oct and found yes indeed that was last payment they drafted. How I hadn't noticed ..not sure. I asked why they had stopped drafting my acct and they claimed there was a \""general error code\"" and it effected not just me. I asked why didn't they contact me via phone and or email. They claimed they did try to call me. But somehow they had wrong phone # when I asked them to verify # they had been calling. I asked why they didn't email me then? They claimed \""we don't do that\"" then why do they keep my email on file in the 1st place? Hmmmmm. But they  were prompt to state they could take 2 months payment over the phone right then to resolve the issue. I told them NO Thanks! You've already shown your Incompetence as a Company and I will No Longer be doing business with them! \nNeedless to say I got a Brand New Water heater for just $259.00 today from an appliance store and my husband installed it per instructions. So the moral of the story is:\nA Home Warranty is Worthless and will cost you more $$ in 99% of the cases!..Especially one like HomeLife."
0,Feeling generous with the one star today. Food was good but service was lacking. I don't believe that you should have to wait 30-40minutes for water to arrive at your table or watch your appetizer pot steam for that long either.  The bad service outweighed the food this time. Disappointed. Seems like the Melting Pot should read some of these reviews to make improvements.
0,"Should be renamed Small Peter's. \n\nFood is pretty good, not going to take that away from them, and a large array of TV's playing different games and shows is a plus as well. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there. The service is TERRIBLE! We had to chase down our waitress not twice, but three times, including when we wanted to pay. We found her in the kitchen, go figure. \n\nTo the bill: $11.50 for a 22oz beer! Holy cow! At least it was $8 after 10p.m, which is still about double what it would be at better establishments. The crowd was good, but a few shady characters, which is to be expected considering the proximity to central Mesa. \n\nThis place is competing with Tilted Kilt, Native New Yorker and Famous Sam's, Willy's falls flat in comparison. Their food doesn't excuse their awful employees and exorbitant prices. Drive a couple miles in any direction for a better place to watch the game."

We were heading out after attempting to go to Haze when a promoter came up to us for the Gold Room and asked us if we wanted to check it out!  We did and they were playing Hip Hop Music and we agreed to go in!  It as a Saturday night and to our surprise, it wasn't crowded at all!  The ladies were $10 each and the guys were $20.  We received a free drink card and a card for half price drinks!!  \n\nWe had a ball!!  We partied all night!  The lounge wasn't crowded at all!  As a group of 30 somethings, we were having a ball with the atmosphere!  The drinks were flowing and the music was very nice!  I believe the DJ was DJ Justin and he had us dancing all night!  A great mix of today's hits with some of yesterdays!!  Totally loved it!!\n\nGreat lounge!!  We had a ball!"
0,"Great for kids, but awful for any adults with functioning taste buds. It was my kid's birthday and I thought he'd like it because of the animatronic animals and all. He did. He got a big kick out of them, the sound effects, thunder, and faux jungle decorations. For dinner he got dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets. Surprisingly, they're the same kind that you can get at most grocery stores for a fraction of the price. Everything here is over priced. It's a huge tourist trap. Even after my wife and I split an entree we still paid a fortune.\n\nThis is a Landry's restaurant. The same company behind the Chart House, Claim Jumper, McCormick and Schmick's, and other  similar spots. As a big corporation, you can see many of the cost-cutting measures they take -- frozen mozzarella sticks, cheap salad dressing, chicken that probably comes from massive feeding/farming plants that documentaries warn us about, rice that is no better than Uncle Ben's, etc. All the ingredients felt and tasted cheap.\n\nThe service, however, was great. Our waitress was so nice and friendly and added to my kid's birthday dinner experience. I hear they're going to close this place sometime this year. I'm not surprised. At least it will force me to take my kid someplace else for his bday next year."
0,"Ever see or hear of the movie '50/50'? Well, I would've loved to have seen that movie at the AMC Esplanade 14 Fork & Screen \""experience\"" because that was the \""experience\"" I had there: 50% good and 50% terrible.\n\nIt all started good - that's the 50%. The waiter Scotty was awesome upfront, the price of the ticket affordable and the food was very good - I had the classic Chicken quesadilla, Parmesan fries and a \""supposedly\"" free-refillable Cherry Coke. The screen and sound were good and so was the idea of having someone come when you needed them by a press of a service button. I'll tell you the truth: I rarely go to the movies these days and it's mostly because of the inconsiderate jerks who use their cell phones, held up as high and bright as possible, to text. Granted, I was literally the only other one in the theatre this time, but I was very prepared to press the button and get anyone kicked out who attempted to ruin yet another good time with their selfish texting.\n\nOk...and here's the 50% bad part: the plastic/barely rocking chairs were uncomfortable after awhile. I ran out of my soda 30 minutes into the showing and I pressed the button. Scotty had not returned. I thought maybe it was broken, so after 10 minutes, I turned it off and on again. Still no Scotty. Finally 30 minutes later he came back with the bill and sternly told me to turn off the button as if it was bothering him the whole time. Uh...#1 it wouldn't be bothering you if you came within, say those first 10 minutes and #2 isn't this the perk of being at this theatre?\n\nIn addition, he didn't give me a pen to sign the receipt. I wasn't about to use the useless button again, so I just left the merchant copy. Only, I thought it appropriate to tip my waiter and I was going to add it using my card on the little \""tip line.\"" Finally, I just put a few dollars I had on me in with the bill. Obviously, he didn't come back to get the receipt, so when I left the theatre when the movie was over, I looked for him. He was gone, wherever. In this economy and for someone working for AMC, you'd think he'd want a couple extra bucks for his efforts. (I say the \""working for AMC\"" part, because I have worked for the company and I know all about minimum wages and abuse from management.)\n\nSo, I took back the tip money, handed the receipt to the bartender and left disappointed. Heck, they didn't even let me keep the plastic Coke cup nor did they honor the menu they publish online: I really wanted the Sicilian Pizzinis but they didn't have it on their hard-copy menu and Scotty know nothing of a \""Pizzinis.\""\n \nSince the \""service\"" button is irrelevant and since I can just as easily eat popcorn or eat at a restaurant before/after, I doubt I'll be driving half-way across the city to come back here any time soon."
0,"I would not recommend this place to vegetarians. I've tried it more than once just to be sure, but even with their vegetarian options I get sick every time. There is not much in terms of their \""vegetable\"" choices. All starch basically. Their food could also taste a little better. Basically it's the same meal, just different sauces. \n\nThe customer service was okay. I do appreciate how clean the place is though. They do a great job keeping the place from looking disgusting and they are one of the cleanest places I've been to for quick food. Their prices could be slightly lower for what they offer, especially since most of the meal is rice. \n\nThe music in the place is loud and that can get tiring, but if you sit outside or in a corner it is a little better. \n\nI would recommend this place for people who eat meat and do not know the taste of authentic food from Thailand, China, Japan, etc. This will be the last time I go here, I'm tired of getting really sick."
0,Horrible place to bring your kids. They go thru teachers like it's no ones business. The staff they had over a year ago was amazing. Now they are rude and could careless about what's going in. Ms Keisha is wonderful however the other director is rude and cares about herself. She doesn't talk to the kids or play with them. A year ago I'd say this place was feast. Now I'd say go anywhere else but there. I pulled my kids out of there and I now have stability for my kids vs random people in and out.
0,"Not impressed- I grew up with Albertsons stores in Texas, but they closed up and moved out around the time I hit middle school. When I moved to LV I was excited to be able to shop here again.\n\nThis location is severely lacking. It's old and dirty, not particularly well stocked or well staffed, and the prices on non-sale items can be a bit ridiculous compared to other places in the city.\n\nWent by when I was on this side of town for a work training, around 8PM. Only one cashier available, Toni, who was openly griping about the job and the customers- TO HER CUSTOMERS. A bit ridiculous.\n\nI grabbed a sale ad when I walked in the door but quite a few items on sale weren't even in stock or were low- only one case of Albersons' brand water, only one case of their house brand 18-count eggs, etc. \n\nThe produce section is confusing, not well laid out, and inconvenient- I only spotted three plastic bag stations, and they were very spaced out, requiring me to go back and forth repeatedly across the entire area. Luckily I was the only person there.\nBut then when I wanted to double check the weight of my veggies, I notice there is only one functional scale to be found. Heaven forbid this place ever have more than five shoppers at once, it would be incredibly irritating.\n\nSubtracting an additional star for the hella-gross rotisserie chicken and sides area, which was already broken down- the large pans with self-serve sides in them were scraped out and filled with water that looked and smelled old. No idea how early they must have broken that station down, but again- it was only 8PM when I went in. Went against my better judgement and got a rotisserie chicken for dinner, and it was small, dry, and had seen better days."
1,"Wow, I'm surprised with most of the reviews here because I am in love with this restaurant.  I've been here a good dozen times since it opened and can't get enough.\n\nStart with the grilled artichoke appetizer.  The chef takes a whole (giant) artichoke, removes the choke, steams it until almost done and then finishes it off on the grill.  The artichoke comes out sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and with a mustardy dip on the side.  Amazing.\n\nAlso, the salads are delicious.  My personal favorite is the seared ahi tuna salad.  It comes with a great champagne dressing and a huge serving of sesame encrusted seared tuna.  So good.  The steak cobb salad is also really good with melt in your mouth croutons, avocado and a great dressing.\n\nI've always had great service here and the food is consistently great."
1,"These guys are awesome. I looked for a bug exterminator after i found a huge cockroach in my sons bedroom.  My family just moved here from Oregon so to see a cockroach was not something i was the excited or familiar seeing too often. I called and the gentleman i spoke with gave me a great deal, even though i had no coupons he gave me a huge discount, and they came out the next day. He was so friendly, and we even had a short conversation about the area since we plan on buying in a 6months. He informed me i could transfer my service as well.  Then the guy that came out which was next day, was so friendly, he knew my neighbors, and was telling me that we live in a good area, and the schools were good, and even told me a pediatrician that i could take my kids to.  So nice, and so personalble, and so welcoming! I'd give this place 10 stars if i could, but i guess 5 will have to do. Highly reccomend! worth every penny, and the are very reasonable!"
1,"Z Pizza has my favorite salad of all times! The Pear and Gorgonzola. It's SO good, I highly recommend! The pizza here is good, too. They don't skimp on toppings, and the crust has an almost sweet flavor to it. I would give them 10 stars for food (when they get it right). We have had some incorrect pick-up orders a few times and sometimes the food is different. Like they forgot some of the stuff the dish or pizza is supposed to include.\nThis location is super small for dining in, so I recommend doing take out or delivery (although they have a very small delivery radius). The other Z Pizza's are good for dining in and even have beer and wine. Cost is average- ask for specials. They also have an online \""Z-tribe club\"" that gives you a free small pizza for signing up and other deals via email. If you just want to try it out, sign up for the club first and you have nothing to lose! The kids that work there are nice enough, but can be a little slow and always seem stoned to me..."
0,"This food was seriously disgusting. First of all, I had trouble even finding something appetizing to eat on the menu. We ordered two rolls and I almost threw up while I was eating it. It was gross and not fresh. Didn't taste good. We also order green mussels and it came with a mountain of imitation crab on top of a little mussel. I couldn't believe it. Service was alright. She asked us if we wanted ginger and wasabi... At a sushi restaurant... Kind of a weird, gross atmosphere. Not pleasant. It was a totally disappointing sushi dinner. I just know I will never come back here and I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone. The 3 1/2 star rating is misleading. -__-"
1,awesome customer service every time and great food.. love eating here!
1,"The Paris Eiffel Tower is undoubtedly one of the premier signatures of the Las Vegas Strip. If you have no problem with heights, I highly suggest taking the elevator ride up the scaled tower. If you go on a weekday like I did, you should have almost no wait, but if you go at night, and a weekend at that, expect to wait in line anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes.\n\nMe and my +1 were flipping through the small Vegas guidebook/coupon book on our last day and saw a 2 for 1 coupon for the Eiffel Tower and made time before our flight. We headed towards Paris and paid $16 for 2 tickets; the coupon can also be used at night. I'd suggest going at night and watching the Bellagio Fountains. The view from the observation deck is just as spectacular in the day.\n\nAfter you pay and get your tickets, you take a few pics, and wait for the elevator ride. I managed to do well until I got to the observation deck. The anxiety kicked in and I should have definitely had a shot or two before making my way up. Nevertheless, I popped a Lorazepam and  managed. The view is ahhhmazing and I snapped a few pics with my Canon. You're allowed to stay up there as long as you want, but it can get windy at night, so take that into consideration. It's true you can get similar view for free at many of the other hotels, but a trip up the Eiffel Tower seems to be on every girl's bucket list."
0,"Well, after last night I'm done with this Mimi's. My mother and I have been going here for years, as long as they have been open. The last couple years this place has been going down hill. The price of the food has been slowly going up and the quality has been going down. When I pay $20 for dinner with a cup of soup that's way the hell to much for a glorified Denny's. My mom and I went here for dinner last night and the place was completely empty. We ordered and waited for our food. I always have the corn chowder because it's usually very good. Last night however it was way to thick and tasteless. I tried salting it but it did nothing. Then the waiter brought our dinner and right when he sat my seafood pasta down I knew something was wrong with it. I could smell a strong pungent odor that was not what it should smell like. The waiter walked away and I took a good whiff. It smelled like rotten urine. I am not exaggerating. This smelled BAD! They had also forgotten to put on the skewer of shrimp that I paid for. I called over another waiter to have him smell it and he said it smelled just fine. He then asked me if I wanted them to make another one so I agreed. He took my dish and went into the kitchen. A few minutes later he came back out with my dish and sat it down. It was obvious it was the same damn one he brought the first time. The scallops were burnt and the pasta was also burned around the outside of the dish. I tried to eat it but it was disgusting. The sauce was way to thick and the pasta was extremely sticky. It tasted horrible! I had one fork full and that was it. I pushed it aside and didn't eat anymore. The waiter came over later and didn't say a thing about the fact that I didn't eat my dinner. Not one sorry, not one can I get you anything else, no manager coming out to try and fix the situation.....nothing! This place has gone to shit. I will never be back. This used to be one of my favorite places but that's no longer the case. Do yourself a favor and just stay away."
1,"This place gets 5 stars because their $10 filet mignon was really yummy.  $10 filet?  Really?  Aaaand the taste was on point.  The fried rice and grilled veggies were good too.  I'm from Cali, and this actually was just as good or a tad better than my favorite $30 teppan dinner at a place called Yanagis.  Seriously, you have to try for yourself.  I told my hubby he need not take me to Benihanas or any other Teppan here in Vegas.  This will do just fine for me."
1,"Quick and good. No place to sit, though?"
1,Good food food the price. Tried the Italian beef sandwich with sweet peppers...really recommend this sandwich. My lunch guest had their Chicago dog and said it was better than what you would get at the ballpark. The meal came with fries and a drink. I will definitely be back again.
1,"Rodney is wonderfully creative with cut, style and color! I have been lightening my hair over this past year.  The problem was, my other hairstylist was over processing my hair over time; therefore, I had unbelievable breakage! During my consultation, Rodney spent the time to share with me the importance of application of color. products and tools.  He told me he was not going to touch my hair for at least 4 weeks, until it had enough growth from the root. To start, he highly suggested a particular shampoo, conditioner and mask.  I took his advice and boy what a difference it made from the first wash! I used the products every other day for 4 weeks. I had my hair appointment yesterday and WOW... he completely changed my dried out, over processed hair into healthy hair! I am so pleased and happy I went to Rodney and followed all of his advice! :)\n\nJennifer Barker Reichman\nParadise Valley, AZ"
1,"Having not been to a Denny's in a while, I must say I was rather impressed with the quality of the food, I got a chessebuger, fries and a salad. The burger was a fresh, handmade patty and was juicy and flavorful. The fries, although not plentiful, were crisp and golden. The salad was loaded with fresh veggies and was one of the better dinner salads I've had in recent memory. The Mrs. got the Prime Rib Cobb Salad, which looked fantastic. Too bad they didn't offer a half size, as it was huge. There were very few people inside and there was no waiting at all upon arrival. The waitress, Anna, was very attentive and the manager even came around to check on us. The good time oldies music playing was a nice touch. This is a good place to go if you can't decide what exactly it is you are hungry for. The menu had plenty of variety and the food was pretty good. I am going with four stars, compared to similar establishments, based on the service and the quality of the food. I would love to see if they can duplicate the same quality and service when they are busy."
0,"I am writing for this particular location, other Chompie's have been great. I have been to this location a few times and have never been impressed with the staff but this last time I had a server that was such a little s#$! with her bad attitude, I will never return. She was rude to the people at the table who ordered water, was awkwardly telling us it was \""weird\"" that we liked our appetizer because others didn't, and explained that even though they advertise \""rare\"" roast beef, it all depends on the cut...what??? Last straw!"
0,"Even \""upgraded\"" to a $500 suite in the Roman Tower, this place reeks of someone's idea of \""nice\"" from the 1950's.  Terrible wi-fi you have to pay for ($16/day), if you want a coffee maker that's an extra $40, no mini-bar but a mini-frig with no ice maker, yes the suite has a a huge room , two toilets, and small bedroom, ancient jetted tub, and steam shower, but the water would not get hot.  Overpriced, with such poor service, we left after the first night of a planned three, immediately got a fantastic, modern, WORKING room at the Mirage for 1/2 the price!  Casino floor seems smokier than Mirage, Paris, or Venetian. NEVER AGAIN!"
0,"BUYER BEWARE! The lady at the Eastern location selling hair is the absolute rudest. I went to buy hair for extensions and she was so busy texting that she told me to hang on.  Then she sold me the wrong  products and when I went to return it she was so rude she said \""sorry we don't accept refunds\"" and turned her back  and started talking to her friend as though I didn't exist.  I will NEVER step foot in that door!!!"
0,overpriced and poor quality food. the service was slow. We had an hour for and had to get to go boxes once they finally gave us our food. was never given a drink refill in the hour we were there.
1,Very decent place to get sushi. Everything was pretty good. I love the Scottsdale Roll. The place is big but wasn't crowded or busy. Nothing special and just an average sushi place but definitely a place to go if you want some good sushi in Arizona.
1,"As you can tell from my other reviews, I have frequented Ruth's Chris Steak House locations all over the country. Overall, this experience was on-par with other locations. The food is consistent. We ordered a petite filet and stuffed chicken breast with the usual sides and found the steak was well prepared and all of our dishes were good. We had some type of banana pudding desert and it wasn't one of the best we have had at a Ruth's Chris. We sat by a window and had a great view of the strip. The service was a bit slow and our server was less than attentive (refills were slow, etc.) but we weren't in a hurry, so it wasn't a huge deal. One of the biggest disappointments, at least to me: the soup of the day was some type of a seafood soup as was the regular menu soup. I would have preferred to see an alternative to a seafood soup offered, just a personal thought.\n\nThe restaurant is located in Harrah's and it was a bit difficult for us to find. You have to take an elevator that is in the middle of the Harrah's casino. If you follow the signs, you will be fine. We overheard the waiter telling another table that this is the largest Ruth's Chris in the nation, but I wouldn't say that it necessarily felt any different than other locations, other than perhaps being a bit more casual."
0,"I completely COMPLETELY agree with Wes N. \n\nTried this place for the first time yesterday for lunch. \n\nFirst of all, there is nothing appropriate for lunch there. Like Wes said, the menu WAS very frustrating to look at. The seating is so small in the single 2-seaters that our super long menus barely fit in front of us - I mean COME ON !!!!\n\nI ordered the \""Deville Club\"" and it was so gigantic (ridiculous) that I could not eat it. I asked the waitress if they could cut it into 4 pieces rather than just two, and I was provided with a STEAK KNIFE. \n\nI hardly ate any of it. The waitress said it is more of a \""Fork and Knife\"" kind of sandwich... should I have to eat a sandwich with a fork & knife.... REALLY?! The Manager came to our table asking for feedback and kindly gave me my meal free of charge - but regardless, I did not enjoy myself at this resto from start to finish. \n\nThis resto is definitely NOT Return-Worthy. Thanks for reading!"
1,"New menu- with lots of old faves! Beautiful outdoor patio, cigar friendly ( love smell which reminds me of husband who occasionally smokes)\nWas here solo for a conference at local hotel. Chase took good care of me, the weather was fab! Saturday there is a pianist.\nNow to the food: their secret balsamic  dressing recipe needs to be whispered in my ear-- wow!! Had steak which was cooked to temperature & tender. Pimento cheese hash was off the hook!!! Give me a shovel, hello!!!\n\nEveryone was attentive and friendly. The inside  atmosphere is lively and classy but not too stuffy or loud. Tv in bar for basketball fans on this important evening!!\n\nWill return next year for my annual conference-- can't wait to see predictable quality with some fun, creative additions!!"
1,"Best rated burger joint with price and quality hands-down. It may not look like a whole lot from the outside, but you should be able to tell my the locals mixed with visitors it's a hot-spot.\n\n- Friendly servers and atmosphere\n- Quality food\n- Can be a bit messy, careful!\n- Reasonably priced\n- Parking can be tricky\n- Check the photos!\n\nYou can easily get lunch for two under $20 with drinks and starter.\n\nI finished up a Spartan Race and headed over to Pinky's to recoup. I needed a massive amount of protein and some potassium for my aching body.\n\nI ordered up some some fried pickles because they usually hit the spot when your starving and don't take long to get to your table. Greg's pickles ($3.95 small) were tasty but not my favorite part of the meal, just too greasy.\n\nI love the whole concept of ordering burgers here, basically you pick 1-3 5oz patties and choose from three styles and can add any additions. EVERYTHING includes mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion & dill pickles. I ordered the WESTSIDE which comes with mustard, chili, slaw & onion. You can also pick DING DONG STYLE with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce. Whatever floats your boat!\n\nThe Mammoth westside style ($5.75) was such a beast. It wasn't very wide but was quite the skyscraper. Can you say jaw fatigue? It really hit the spot. \n\nMy wife picked up the Green Chile Pork ($6.25) and we both loved it. You can't go wrong with marinated pork grilled with pineapple slices, melted swiss cheese, arugula and jamaican mayonnaise on a seeded bun. The sauce had so much flavor and pineapple added such a boost.\n\nI loved this place, although I could have went without the pickles. This will be a place I stop at often when in the area!"
0,Just wanted a place to watch the games. Customer service is not as attentive as I would like but not a bad place to grab a couple drinks and watch the games. Food isnt too great average bar food. Probably will not come here that often.
0,"Ate here with Donny C for a friends bday, but sat at a different table.  We received this promotion where it was buy one get one free.  \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered crab cakes, calamari, and a salad.\n\nThe crab cakes were good,  but the calarmari and crab salad were forgettable.  The crab salad looked like it was just a head of lettuce with some sauce and crab piled on top of it.\n\nI ordered the surf n turf as my buddy really wanted to order it.  Since it was buy one get one free, value wise I thought okay I\""ll get this.  The steak was ok, but nothing compared to Cut's steak.  The lobster was a tad bit over cooked.\n\nThe servers/waiters do NOT fill up your water glasses.  They took our appetizers away even though we weren't even done with them!  Poor service.\n\nWill not return..  The fish looked alot better.  Good thing we got half off everything!"
1,We stopped here after here surviving a terrifying dust storm on I-10.  We were lucky.  The people on our side of the freeway managed to stop safely and skillfully.  The people on the other side weren't as lucky:  http://www.sfgate.com/news/us/article/3-dead-after-dust-causes-crashes-on-I-10-in-Ariz-4936646.php  After we continued on our way we saw many highway patrol vehicles heading for what we inferred was a pileup on the southbound side.  \n\nWe got off the freeway and after driving a while saw this Starbucks.  We made a U-turn and went back to it.  I had a cup of Earl Grey tea and Alan had an iced coffee.  Jazz played overhead and it was a comfortable place to relax and unwind.  The bathrooms were clean and comfortable.  I'm neither a partisan nor a hater of Starbucks.  This was a hospitable place to regroup before getting back on the road.  The barista was helpful and friendly.
0,"The Sahara, where the Beatles played at when they were in Vegas.\n\nThis place is aged, and small, and smokey, and all in all... OLD. It's like that guy that was catcher at the starting lineup for your favorite baseball team, who was bounced after a couple years, became a journeyman, and now is playing single A ball for some independent league out in the corn fields of Nebraska, hoping to scrape up enough cash to pay rent at his cheap-o hotel room.\n\nThe rooms are small (and smell). It's old school vegas, but without the cool of the Rat Pack. There are only 3 things that keep me from giving it the one star finger:\n\n1: It's next to the monorail\n2: They hosted the Amazing Jonathan (still do to my knowledge)\n3: $5 blackjack.\n\n1 and 3 are no longer big drawers for me, now that I'm out of college and have a bit more expendable income, but they keep the 2nd star for Amazing Jonathan. And this story.\n\nMy buddy and I were playing here after a show, fairly sauced, and not fully loaded down in the wallet. We're playing a $5 table, just to pass some time, and maybe make a little bit more cash. Drink server comes by to take our order, I ask for a beer, he asks for a Johnny Walker Black and soda.\n\nKeep in mind, we're at the $5 table. My friend is shocked to near speechlessness (unfortunatly he couldn't be shocked to total speechlessness 'cause he bitched the whole way back to our hotel) when his JWB came back looking like a drop of johnny, and a glass of soda. I had to remind him, $5 table, but I do get a chuckle everytime I remember his face of what basically amounted to a slight amber tinted cloud in a glass of water."
0,"I love Jimmy Buffet and I had a blast at the Margaritaville in Key West, but this place is just not worth the headache.   It is packed all day long and probably seats 1000 people.  We shared some apps, wings were horrible, HORRIBLE.  The service was a complete mess.   Sorry Jimmy, I'll have to wait till I'm in Key West for another Cheeseburger in Paradise.."
0,"Tucked away on the side of Aria (too bad not completely hidden out of sight) is this place. New, modern, industrial-styled restaurant which follows the theme of City Center nicely. That is where the impressiveness ends. Once seated you get a menu that offers a variety of rolls and sashimi. I should have left when I saw the ridiculous prices of 1 vs. 2 pieces of sashimi ($10-20 vs $30-40!?!?!!)!\n\nTypically I don't mind paying for great food and a great experience which is what i thought i was going to get when I ordered the Chef's Tasting menu ($100/person). Yes, the food was good but the value left me hungry a half hour after I left. I can't even remember what I had because it was all eaten in about 10 bites...you're better off going to cosmo and getting 2 slices of pizza for 10 bucks that's going to at least leave you satisfied. \n\nI am mostly mad at myself for trying this place on a whim and not consulting with Yelp beforehand. Thats the last time I try to be adventurous (probably not but you know what I mean). The quality of food and service can be had elsewhere for a fifth of the price, I dont care if it is on the glorified strip and in a glorified hotel, you have to be wiping with benjamin's to eat at this place."
1,"This local pet boutique is a charm and a breath of fresh air from the big pet stores. Noble Beast carries the best pet food available along with high quality toys, bedding, carriers and treats. The staff is friendly and willing to special order any item for you. The store is doggon cute...so you immediately step into a fun environment when entering the store. They also support the Rescue group, have special activities for your four legged friends, and always try to make your experience in their store a good one."
1,We were in town for a graduation & found Sabor on Yelp. We were not disappointed. We made a last minute lunch reservation for a party of 11 and they graciously accommodated us.\n\nThe service was great and the food was delicious! The food is a nod to traditional Mexican dishes. It was elegant and flavorful along the lines of Mary Sue Miliken & Susan Finiger's Border Grill Restaurants. The mole dish was great as were the imaginative salads. Lots of great options for the vegetarians in our group.\n\nLocals please patronize this restaurant so us out-of- towners can get some wonderful Latin food in Henderson! :)

We asked again and mind you, we asked politely. She never acknowledge us after that...she looked miserable w/ her job. I've never been so fckn pissed in my life that this stupid, rude Bitch had to ruin Fridays. My friends and I were so appalled that we decided to go somewhere else."
1,Great food and excellent service. Best burger we ever had. We definitely will be going back. Sure its a little expensive for a burger joint but as soon as u realize its not a fast food place u get over it quick

I came here a little after 12p on a Wednesday- there were only 2 windows open, both helping customers. The tellers seemed to both have a really happy friendly attitude. When I got there I was the only other customer. Along w/the 2 tellers, there were at least 3 other employees (manager, etc) just roaming around.. All very smiley & enthusiastic looking. Problem is- even though I was the NEXT customer in line, I still waited 20-25 min- & none of the smiley people roaming around acknowledged this, offered to help, etc. \n\nAt the branches I frequent when people are waiting too long, the mgr jumps in & opens a window... or invites you over to a desk to be helped (not to mention they also greet you at the door or shortly after you've entered, offer you a water, otherwise attempt to acknowledge & be helpful). All I had was a simple check to deposit into someone's acct. By the time I was seen there were 8 people in line & still just the same 2 very nice but very slow tellers. \n\nIt's one thing to be super busy & slammed during rush hour. It's another to be completely dead yet oblivious to your customers- smiley or not. \n\nI avoided a nearby branch inside a grocery store (Fry's on 7th ave & Camelback) & chose this one.. Thinking a stand-alone branch would be better. I was wrong. The next day when I had to go back to the bank I went to the Fry's location- where I received prompt friendly service & was in & out in 2 min.\n\nI'm going to be moving back to Phx part-time, & I definitely have no need for this branch w/ its sub-par ability to acknowledge & help its customers. I realize you may not have been open long, but you need to run a tighter ship."
0,I gave this place a try even though I read terrible reviews. It was a disappointment that the negative reviews lived up to it's expectations.\n\nI went with a party of 6 on a Friday night. The wait was 45 minutes which none of us minded because we were all thrilled to dine here since they opened. We had two waitresses both who were unprofessional. We ordered our food. About 40 minutes later they brought out our friends' pizzas but not the meatballs we ore
1,"I agree with Brett C that the best word to sum this place up is: Perfect.\n\nI have the pleasure of dining here a small handful of times (and have a booking for Saturday night!) and it has met and exceeded expectations every time.  The food is beautiful without being pretentious, filling and reasonably priced, the wait staff is attentive and friendly, and the physical space is cozy and very real.  \n\nNo wonder I booked for my birthday meal!  \n\nThis place is a must visit for when my parents are here as well.  We have eaten at Michelin starred restaurants and yet they prefer The Shore every time."

The waiters never come around to check on your table nor are they easy to find and flag down. Once being seated it took the waiter 21 minutes to comeback to our table to take our orders. The restaurant wasn't busy at all. Maybe three tables were occupied.\n\nThey also have an outside sitting area that faces the parking lot so the time it takes to get served and have your bill delivered you can eat and hop right into your car and leave and I bet that they won't even know you're missing.\n\nAfter we finished our meals it took the waiter another 15 minutes to bring our bill to us.\n\nOverall, a great place to eat. A bit expensive but worth every penny. And make sure you have patience and a lot of time on your hands because you're going to be waiting forever on your meals, drinks, and service."

From the people who work there, to the ones taking classes, every single person I talked to was so nice. Huge, since I was so nervous about feeling uncomfortable or lost. I signed up right away after that. Feels like home already. Not to mention, the workout was a blast!"
1,"Got a groupon as a gift to try out threading for here they did a great job and it didn't even hurt as much as everyone said. There was a slight wait but didn't bother me, they were happy to add services and even gave me a free feather hair extension, they were really friendly and i will go back"
1,"What a lucky treat, we got here on Meatless Monday, I highly recommend this option for vegetarians. The service was excellent, deep knowledge of the food and preparation. I had the Molitas (off the menu) which was the highlight for me, great smokey flavor in the sauce and greens, anchoring a portobello mushroom entree. Another standout was the plantain empanada, part of the appetizer sampler along with quinoa fritters. This place was a little out of the way and it wasn't as cheap as I expected .... but was well worth it."
