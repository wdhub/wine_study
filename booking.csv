1,1,"Stockholm is a wonderful city.  I went to Istanbul for the first time.  We stayed at Queen&#39;s hotel on our trip to Stockholm.  The hotel is in the center of the city, walking distance to everywhere.  There is everything around.  Employees are very engaged.  Rooms are clean and nice."
2,1,very pleasant stay
3,0,Check in is at 3pm.Very very noisy guests when we were staying - right above us. The hotel is not at fault of course!

5,0,Room very compact but it was a single
6,1,Perfect location on pedestrian shopping street with loads or restaurants. Great breakfast
7,0,The hotel is older and furnishings are very basic.
8,1,"Great location and friendly, helpful staff. Excellent breakfast!"
9,0,"No shelf or flat surface in the bathroom. Where can you put a sponge-bag, razor etc? The shower leaked water over a large part of the floor making the bath mat wet( room 105). It would be nice, especially for ladies, to have a mirror above the dressing table. Tea and coffee making facilities in the bedroom would be nice. It was good that they were available in the foyer but it is awkward to have to carry cups to the room especially as the doors have strong hinges and need to be unlocked and opened with some force."
10,1,"Helpful, friendly staff. Clean and modern room. Excellent position for access to centre of Stockholm. Good breakfast, perhaps a bigger variety of fruit or a fresh fruit salad would be good."
11,0,"Just be aware when booking rooms  - if on the street side, it can be a little noisy with traffic etc"

19,1,"Good hotel in great location, convenient for everything. Staff were very helpful and understanding, especially reception staff, thank you for taking good care."
20,0,"the only thing we struggled with and was difficult to live with was no air conditioning. it was very hot every day and although the staff were wonderful and got us fans, we were sweating every day in the room.

Walking distance to central train station is about 12 min.  Staff is very helpful; breakfast is ample and good; luggage storage available.

68,1,"Great service, cozy room, super price and location!"
69,0,itâs an old building with old windows and it being December while my stay made the cold creep in. I slept on the side of the window and a constant cold hit me. the heating was full on but couldnât compensate the cold.
70,1,"Awesome location, really friendly staff, very nice breakfast buffet"
71,0,Show holder was loose and couldn&#39;t tighten.
72,1,"Central position, 10 mins walk from train station. Character room with high ceilings and wooden floor, comfortable bed."

74,1,Everything was fine except for the low temperature in our room.
75,0,The room was a bit cool.

92,0,"Poor breakfast, kids were disappointed that didn&#39;t find panckakes..."
93,1,"Excellent location in the center, underground parking near hotel for 40 eur for 24 h. Room enough spacious, clean."
94,0,"Actually there were all the must-haves. I would probably add a fridge in the room, a shelf in the bathroom, some more electrical sockets by the beds. However that does not influence the overall impression."
95,1,"Almost everything was quite pleasant. Starting from the arrival and the opportunity to leave the baggage in the luggage room. A large reception area with a tea&#47;coffee pot and stuffed with sofas and armchairs is a great complement. The room itself is considerably spacious, but not very warm. Luckily there was an electric heater. Breakfast was tasty with different options for cold and warm dishes exactly what I personally like - scrambled eggs, sandwich options, milk and yogurt with corn flakes and muesli, pastry, coffee and tea - quite enough for a good start of a day. And the people, surely, the receptionists were always helpful. The building itself, its architecture is of  much interest. Location is also great. Not the very center packed with tourists, but very close to it, in 10-15 minutes walk distance from the Old City, which is a fully equipped shopping area."
96,0,Late checkout charge at per hour. We book 2 rooms and would like to request for one room to have late checkout as my baby may would like to nap during the afternoon time as our flight is at 9pm. But the staff would like to charge us even there is room available.Water boiler only at receiptionCoffee tea only at receiption
97,1,Location. But the route to hotel is not luggage friendly as the road is bumpy. And beware your valuable item as my mum phone got stolen on the way to hotel.Free unlimited coffee and tea at receiption
98,1,"breakfast, location"
99,0,nothing particular.
100,1,Perfekt lokation i centre of Stockholm
101,0,"The heating was insufficient. The overall state of the building still needs improvement. The room offers enough comfort, but could be better. Since there are smart TVs in the rooms, the hotel could allow access to Internet, for services like YouTube or netflix, considering the TV channels offer is limited."
102,1,Great location. Great breakfast. Friendly staff and comfortable enough room.
103,0,Sound proofing of rooms was not good. Facing road noisy at times
104,1,Breakfast was simple. Max 2 days and you will get tired of the selection. Room is big and clean
105,1,Excellent location and friendly staff.
106,1,"Price, location and staff amazing, really I appreciate it. Thanks guys."
107,0,"The door and windows are a bit thin, so the noise from outside is too high."
108,1,"Very clean room, nice and helpful employees, good breakfast with good choice."
109,0,Our 3-person room was very cramped and the bathroom small for 3 adults.
110,1,Incredible location..easy to get everywhere walking.  Very quiet so sleeping never a problem and the beds were extremely comfortable.  Elevator was small and very old but in great working condition.  Very nice breakfast spread everyday.  This was a great value overall.
111,0,Cutlery could be cleaner.
112,1,Great location om Drottningsgatan. Breakfast good.
113,0,Nothing
114,1,Location and clean
115,0,"In one sentence...It just didnât feel like value for money at SEK1690 for a small double (more on that below). Granted, being a local, I donât usually stay in Stockholm hotels, but am a frequent guest in Oslo and Copenhagen (both relatively expensive locations) and I cannot recall ever having paid so much for as disappointing a room&#47;hotel as this. The lobby is fine and the room was clean, but it wasnât even possible to open the bathroom door properly because the bed was in the way...there is not space for a double bed in the room, it is a single room with a double bed. Breakfast starting at 0800 is unacceptable on a normal weekend day (0730 barely acceptable, 0700 OK, 0630 or before good), but on the day after summer time changed, just bonkers! My body was screaming for breakfast at 0630 but I had to wait until 0800 (when my body thought it was 0900)...so had to go out early to find something to tie me over! Breakfast itself was certainly a satisfactory spread without being great. So if you expect breakfast soon after you wake, and your hotel to also feel as though at least a little thought has gone into your experience as a guest, then best go elsewhere. But if you just want a clean place to sleep, and late breakfast doesnât bother you, then I guess itâs an alright place to stay."
116,1,Location fantastic. Room clean.
117,0,Nothing
118,1,"The location was close to the train station and in the middle of the shopping district, perfect for access to everything."
119,1,"Good location on pedestrian walkway, more spacious than most hotel rooms."
120,0,"Windows are old (and thin) and room faced the street, which meant all noises travelled easily - everything from conversations to vehicles. Also at 4 am thereâs a street cleaning vehicle driving past. If you donât mind noises or can sleep with ear plugs, then this wonât bother you. For someone who normally lives in a very quiet area and needs a good nights sleep, this was quite disruptive..."
121,1,"Very nice and helpful staff. Clean rooms, comfortable bed, good sized bathroom. Nice breakfast. Perfect location with only 10 min to central station."
122,0,better choices for breakfast
123,1,Good location

126,0,Towels are a little small and there is no slippers.
127,1,"Location is perfect. Staff is welcoming, rooms are clean. Amazing breakfast!"
128,0,"Very minor points - the floor was a little dusty beside the beds, the electric sockets were a little loose and the cups were not washed up each day. But these are so so minor - this is purely a heads up should you have more picky guests!"
129,1,"The staff were a pleasure. They all seemed so happy, helpful and kind. A wonderful example to the city and the country of Sweden.Location is outstanding. We couldn&#39;t have picked a better spot with the bus&#47;train terminal, underground and old town all within a few minutes walk."

157,1,Location was very good and the staff was lovely ð
158,0,Didn&#39;t like the dining room. Gloomy and crowded.
159,0,"It was 16 degrees outside and it was already very cold in the room, heating didnât work and windows are very old and not protect from the wind. There is no electric outlets near the bed, itâs difficult in general to find where to charge your devices in the room. Staff on check in just gave me plastic cards and small paper and said âyour room is XXXâ, didnât explain where to go and how to find the room. She also forced us to sign in for breakfast for several days in advance although we wanted to decide it every evening. Itâs disturbing especially during check in when we were tired after long journey and totally wet because of the rain."
160,1,"Location, high ceilings in the rooms, free tea and coffee in the lobby"
161,0,"We had booked two single rooms, but one of the rooms was absolutely not up to par. It was tiny, cold, the tap didn&#39;t work properly and the window couldn&#39;t be closed fully and there was somebody (probably another guest) sitting on a bench right outside the window smoking and listening to noisy music on his phone at two o&#39;clock in the morning. This room was not worth the money."
162,1,"Location, breakfast."
163,0,broken old hair dryer. No turn down service. Simple room service options.
164,1,"Breakfast was great! there was a lot to choose from, fresh and always topped up. The location was brilliant, right in the heart of the main street. Easy to get around and explore. The room needs a few refreshers. An option for a room make-up service would be nice."

(clementine, and small cucumber burger and pepper pickels... top)."

178,1,"Great service, old building, clean rooms with seriously good beads."
179,0,"Old beds that have been used for many yearsBathroom without windows and aspirations And the noises from the road and inside the hotel, made us feel like we where sleeping in a camping tent. Breakfast was everyday the same and boring."
180,1,The location and staff
181,0,"WiFi was very slow most of the time.Parking is a bit of an issue - but got lucky with on-street parking about 100m, which is cheaper than main car parks."
182,1,"Location was fine - a bit of a walk&#47;bus journey to main areas for sight-seeing, but convenient enough. Breakfast was good. Building has more character than many hotels."

193,0,The rooms were very small.
194,1,It was very clean and good location.
195,0,The floor of the bathroom tended to flood a bit when showering so a mop would have been useful.
196,1,"The hotel has character and the triple room was spacious. The bathroom was reasonable in size and ok for showering. The breakfast was good with a wide variety of food. The hotel is located abount 1km from the harbour area and about another 1km from Gamla Stan centre, so walkable. Central Sation is about 2km away so again walkable."

203,1,room was clean and with windows. quiet area. nice view over buildings of Stockholm.Breakfast was good and varied
204,0,"The bathroom probably hasnât been re-done in about 40 years, so although itâs clean, itâs very out of date. this didnât really bother us much, apart from the shower soaking the whole bathroom because the curtain was ineffective, but apart from it being a mild inconvenience, I actually thought it was quite amusing. itâs also quite noisy outside, but if you want a hotel with a decent city centre location, then youâre going to have to expect that."
205,1,"good location, nice staff and after we upgraded our room (the economy double is very small) it was really good value. the breakfast was decent too, everything youâd want."
206,0,Breakfast OK

209,1,"great location, nice old building"
210,1,It was a pleasant surprise to see the roomâs decor and a bathtub! Beds were so comfy and I love the view of the tower from the window. Breakfast was ok! And location is fantastic! We got to check in earlier and it made the trip such a comfort!

212,1,"The hotel is situated a bit out of the centre, but close enough to walk to Gamla Stan or DjurgÃ¥rden. Room and other facilities were clean, the service was excellent and breakfast was good."

219,0,better air conditioning to assist with the summer heat.
220,1,"The room was spacious and comfortable and we really liked the small touches, such as the heated towel racks and toiletries. the staff were helpful and friendly and because the hotel is centrally located, we could experience Stockholm on foot without having to worry about transport. the breakfast buffet was delicious!"
